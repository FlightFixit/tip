<h1>Two Hearts</h1>
<h2>by Peter S. Beagle</h2>
<h3>from <cite>Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</cite> - October&ndash;November 2005</h3>

<p><i>Friends, family, and fans have all asked me, over the years, to write a sequel to <cite>The Last Unicorn</cite>. To each in turn I have responded with some variant of the following: <q>It can't be done. <cite>The Last Unicorn</cite> is a one-shot, meant from the beginning as a kind of spoof/tribute to the classic European fairytale, an homage to such beloved influences of mine as James Stephens, Lord Dunsany, T. H. White and James Thurber. Writing it was a nightmarish, seemingly endless labor, and when it was done I vowed never to attempt such a balancing act again. So thank you for asking, but no.</q></i></p>

<p><i>It wasn't a hard vow to keep: there were other books I wanted to write, and I have always had a real horror of repeating myself. Besides, like everyone else (and quite against my own personal wishes), I grew older.</i> The Last Unicorn <i>is a young man's work, and I am not quite him anymore in so many different ways.</i></p>

<p><i>Yet here I am, writing an introduction for a sequel to <cite>The Last Unicorn</cite>.</i></p>

<p><i>I blame Connor Cochran entirely for the existence of <q>Two Hearts.</q> He proposed it as a bonus gift for the first 3,000 buyers of the audiobook of <cite>The Last Unicorn</cite>, and wheedled me into going along by assuring me that I needn't bring back a single one of the original cast&#8212;only the world of the novel, nothing more. So, of course, I presented him with four of the major characters, and references to a couple of others, and had an astonishingly fine time doing it. The trouble now, of course, is that I can't abandon Sooz, my young narrator. I'm going to have to bring her back and see where she wants to go &hellip; which will be, as I already know, into the real full-novel sequel to <cite>The Last Unicorn</cite>. Which I never wanted to write. <i>Bozhe moy</i>, as my Russian uncles used to say. Heaven help me&hellip;.</i></p>

<hr />

<p>My brother Wilfrid keeps saying it's not fair that it should all have happened to me. Me being a girl, and a baby, and too stupid to lace up my own sandals properly. But <i>I</i> think it's fair. I think everything happened exactly the way it should have done. Except for the sad parts, and maybe those too.</p>

<p>I'm Sooz, and I am nine years old. Ten next month, on the anniversary of the day the griffin came. Wilfrid says it was because of me, that the griffin heard that the ugliest baby in the world had just been born, and it was going to eat me, but I was <i>too</i> ugly, even for a griffin. So it nested in the Midwood (we call it that, but its real name is the Midnight Wood, because of the darkness under the trees), and stayed to eat our sheep and our goats. Griffins do that if they like a place.</p>

<p>But it didn't ever eat children, not until this year.</p>

<p>I only saw it once&#8212;I mean, once <i>before</i>&#8212;rising up above the trees one night, like a second moon. Only there wasn't a moon, then. There was nothing in the whole world but the griffin, golden feathers all blazing on its lion's body and eagle's wings, with its great front claws like teeth, and that monstrous beak that looked so huge for its head&hellip;. Wilfrid says I screamed for three days, but he's lying, and I <i>didn't</i> hide in the root cellar like he says either, I slept in the barn those two nights, with our dog Malka. Because I knew Malka wouldn't let anything get me.</p>

<p>I mean my parents wouldn't have, either, not if they could have stopped it. It's just that Malka is the biggest, fiercest dog in the whole village, and she's not afraid of anything. And after the griffin took Jehane, the blacksmith's little girl, you couldn't help seeing how frightened my father was, running back and forth with the other men, trying to organize some sort of patrol, so people could always tell when the griffin was coming. I know he was frightened for me and my mother, and doing everything he could to protect us, but it didn't make me feel any safer, and Malka did.</p>

<p>But nobody knew what to do, anyway. Not my father, nobody. It was bad enough when the griffin was only taking the sheep, because almost everyone here sells wool or cheese or sheepskin things to make a living. But once it took Jehane, early last spring, that changed everything. We sent messengers to the king&#8212;three of them&#8212;and each time the king sent someone back to us with them. The first time, it was one knight, all by himself. His name was Douros, and he gave me an apple. He rode away into the Midwood, singing, to look for the griffin, and we never saw him again.</p>

<p>The second time&#8212;after the griffin took Louli, the boy who worked for the miller&#8212;the king sent five knights together. One of them did come back, but he died before he could tell anyone what happened.</p>

<p>The third time an entire squadron came. That's what my father said, anyway. I don't know how many soldiers there are in a squadron, but it was a lot, and they were all over the village for two days, pitching their tents everywhere, stabling their horses in every barn, and boasting in the tavern how they'd soon take care of that griffin for us poor peasants. They had musicians playing when they marched into the Midwood&#8212;I remember that, and I remember when the music stopped, and the sounds we heard afterward.</p>

<p>After that, the village didn't send to the king anymore. We didn't want more of his men to die, and besides they weren't any help. So from then on all the children were hurried indoors when the sun went down, and the griffin woke from its day's rest to hunt again. We couldn't play together, or run errands or watch the flocks for our parents, or even sleep near open windows, for fear of the griffin. There was nothing for me to do but read books I already knew by heart, and complain to my mother and father, who were too tired from watching after Wilfrid and me to bother with us. They were guarding the other children too, turn and turn about with the other families&#8212;<i>and</i> our sheep, <i>and</i> our goats&#8212;so they were always tired, as well as frightened, and we were all angry with each other most of the time. It was the same for everybody.</p>

<p>And then the griffin took Felicitas.</p>

<p>Felicitas couldn't talk, but she was my best friend, always, since we were little. I always understood what she wanted to say, and she understood me, better than anyone, and we played in a special way that I won't ever play with anyone else. Her family thought she was a waste of food, because no boy would marry a dumb girl, so they let her eat with us most of the time. Wilfrid used to make fun of the whispery quack that was the one sound she could make, but I hit him with a rock, and after that he didn't do it anymore.</p>

<p>I didn't see it happen, but I still see it in my head. She <i>knew</i> not to go out, but she was always just so happy coming to us in the evening. And nobody at her house would have noticed her being gone. None of them ever noticed Felicitas.</p>

<p>The day I learned Felicitas was gone, that was the day I set off to see the king myself.</p>

<p>Well, the same <i>night</i>, actually&#8212;because there wasn't any chance of getting away from my house or the village in daylight. I don't know what I'd have done, really, except that my Uncle Ambrose was carting a load of sheepskins to market in Hagsgate, and you have to start long before sunup to be there by the time the market opens. Uncle Ambrose is my best uncle, but I knew I couldn't ask him to take me to the king&#8212;he'd have gone straight to my mother instead, and told her to give me sulphur and molasses and put me to bed with a mustard plaster. He gives his <i>horse</i> sulphur and molasses, even.</p>

<p>So I went to bed early that night, and I waited until everyone was asleep. I wanted to leave a note on my pillow, but I kept writing things and then tearing the notes up and throwing them in the fireplace, and I was afraid of somebody waking, or Uncle Ambrose leaving without me. Finally I just wrote, <i>I will come home soon.</i> I didn't take any clothes with me, or anything else, except a bit of cheese, because I thought the king must live somewhere near Hagsgate, which is the only big town I've ever seen. My mother and father were snoring in their room, but Wilfrid had fallen asleep right in front of the hearth, and they always leave him there when he does. If you rouse him to go to his own bed, he comes up fighting and crying. I don't know why.</p>

<p>I stood and looked down at him for the longest time. Wilfrid doesn't look nearly so mean when he's sleeping. My mother had banked the coals to make sure there'd be a fire for tomorrow's bread, and my father's moleskin trews were hanging there to dry, because he'd had to wade into the stockpond that afternoon to rescue a lamb. I moved them a little bit, so they wouldn't burn. I wound the clock&#8212;Wilfrid's supposed to do that every night, but he always forgets&#8212;and I thought how they'd all be hearing it ticking in the morning while they were looking everywhere for me, too frightened to eat any breakfast, and I turned to go back to my room.</p>

<p>But then I turned around again, and I climbed out of the kitchen window, because our front door squeaks so. I was afraid that Malka might wake in the barn and right away know I was up to something, because I can't ever fool Malka, only she didn't, and then I held my breath almost the whole way as I ran to Uncle Ambrose's house and scrambled right into his cart with the sheepskins. It was a cold night, but under that pile of sheepskins it was hot and nasty-smelling, and there wasn't anything to do but lie still and wait for Uncle Ambrose. So I mostly thought about Felicitas, to keep from feeling so bad about leaving home and everyone. That was bad enough&#8212;I never really <i>lost</i> anybody close before, not <i>forever</i>&#8212;but anyway it was different.</p>

<p>I don't know when Uncle Ambrose finally came, because I dozed off in the cart, and didn't wake until there was this jolt and a rattle and the sort of floppy grumble a horse makes when <i>he's</i> been waked up and doesn't like it&#8212;and we were off for Hagsgate. The half-moon was setting early, but I could see the village bumping by, not looking silvery in the light, but small and dull, no color to anything. And all the same I almost began to cry, because it already seemed so far away, though we hadn't even passed the stockpond yet, and I felt as though I'd never see it again. I would have climbed back out of the cart right then, if I hadn't known better.</p>

<p>Because the griffin was still up and hunting. I couldn't see it, of course, under the sheepskins (and I had my eyes shut, anyway), but its wings made a sound like a lot of knives being sharpened all together, and sometimes it gave a cry that was dreadful because it was so soft and gentle, and even a little sad and <i>scared</i>, as though it were imitating the sound Felicitas might have made when it took her. I burrowed deep down as I could, and tried to sleep again, but I couldn't.</p>

<p>Which was just as well, because I didn't want to ride all the way into Hagsgate, where Uncle Ambrose was bound to find me when he unloaded his sheepskins in the marketplace. So when I didn't hear the griffin anymore (they won't hunt far from their nests, if they don't have to), I put my head out over the tailboard of the cart and watched the stars going out, one by one, as the sky grew lighter. The dawn breeze came up as the moon went down.</p>

<p>When the cart stopped jouncing and shaking so much, I knew we must have turned onto the King's Highway, and when I could hear cows munching and talking softly to each other, I dropped into the road. I stood there for a little, brushing off lint and wool bits, and watching Uncle Ambrose's cart rolling on away from me. I hadn't ever been this far from home by myself. Or so lonely. The breeze brushed dry grass against my ankles, and I didn't have any idea which way to go.</p>

<p>I didn't even know the king's name&#8212;I'd never heard anyone call him anything but <i>the king.</i> I knew he didn't live in Hagsgate, but in a big castle somewhere nearby, only nearby's one thing when you're riding in a cart and different when you're walking. And I kept thinking about my family waking up and looking for me, and the cows&#8217; grazing sounds made me hungry, and I'd eaten all my cheese in the cart. I wished I had a penny with me&#8212;not to buy anything with, but only to toss up and let it tell me if I should turn left or right. I tried it with flat stones, but I never could find them after they came down. Finally I started off going left, not for any reason, but only because I have a little silver ring on my left hand that my mother gave me. There was a sort of path that way too, and I thought maybe I could walk around Hagsgate and then I'd think about what to do after that. I'm a good walker. I can walk anywhere, if you give me time.</p>

<p>Only it's easier on a real road. The path gave out after awhile, and I had to push my way through trees growing too close together, and then through so many brambly vines that my hair was full of stickers and my arms were all stinging and bleeding. I was tired and sweating, and almost crying&#8212;<i>almost&#8212;</i> and whenever I sat down to rest bugs and things kept crawling over me. Then I heard running water nearby, and that made me thirsty right away, so I tried to get down to the sound. I had to crawl most of the way, scratching my knees and elbows up something awful.</p>

<p>It wasn't much of a stream&#8212;in some places the water came up barely above my ankles&#8212;but I was so glad to see it I practically hugged and kissed it, flopping down with my face buried in it, the way I do with Malka's smelly old fur. And I drank until I couldn't hold any more, and then I sat on a stone and let the tiny fish tickle my nice cold feet, and felt the sun on my shoulders, and I didn't think about griffins or kings or my family or anything.</p>

<p>I only looked up when I heard the horses whickering a little way upstream. They were playing with the water, the way horses do, blowing bubbles like children. Plain old livery-stable horses, one brownish, one grayish. The gray's rider was out of the saddle, peering at the horse's left forefoot. I couldn't get a good look&#8212;they both had on plain cloaks, dark green, and trews so worn you couldn't make out the color&#8212;so I didn't know that one was a woman until I heard her voice. A nice voice, low, like Silky Joan, the lady my mother won't ever let me ask about, but with something rough in it too, as though she could scream like a hawk if she wanted to. She was saying, <q>There's no stone I can see. Maybe a thorn?</q></p>

<p>The other rider, the one on the brown horse, answered her, <q>Or a bruise. Let me see.</q></p>

<p>That voice was lighter and younger-sounding than the woman's voice, but I already knew he was a man, because he was so tall. He got down off the brown horse and the woman moved aside to let him pick up her horse's foot. Before he did that, he put his hands on the horse's head, one on each side, and he said something to it that I couldn't quite hear. <i>And the horse said something back</i>. Not like a neigh, or a whinny, or any of the sounds horses make, but like one person talking to another. I can't say it any better than that. The tall man bent down then, and he took hold of the foot and looked at it for a long time, and the horse didn't move or switch its tail or anything.</p>

<p><q>A stone splinter,</q> the man said after a while. <q>It's very small, but it's worked itself deep into the hoof, and there's an ulcer brewing. I can't think why I didn't notice it straightaway.</q></p>

<p><q>Well,</q> the woman said. She touched his shoulder. <q>You can't notice everything.</q></p>

<p>The tall man seemed angry with himself, the way my father gets when he's forgotten to close the pasture gate properly, and our neighbor's black ram gets in and fights with our poor old Brimstone. He said, <q>I can. I'm supposed to.</q> Then he turned his back to the horse and bent over that forefoot, the way our blacksmith does, and he went to work on it.</p>

<p>I couldn't see what he was doing, not exactly. He didn't have any picks or pries, like the blacksmith, and all I'm sure of is that I <i>think</i> he was singing to the horse. But I'm not sure it was proper singing. It sounded more like the little made-up rhymes that really small children chant to themselves when they're playing in the dirt, all alone. No tune, just up and down, <i>dee-dah, dee-dah, dee &hellip; </i>boring even for a horse, I'd have thought. He kept doing it for a long time, still bending with that hoof in his hand. All at once he stopped singing and stood up, holding something that glinted in the sun the way the stream did, and he showed it to the horse, first thing. <q>There,</q> he said, <q>there, that's what it was. It's all right now.</q></p>

<p>He tossed the thing away and picked up the hoof again, not singing, only touching it very lightly with one finger, brushing across it again and again. Then he set the foot down, and the horse stamped once, hard, and whinnied, and the tall man turned to the woman and said, <q>We ought to camp here for the night, all the same. They're both weary, and my back hurts.</q></p>

<p>The woman laughed. A deep, sweet, slow sound, it was. I'd never heard a laugh like that. She said, <q>The greatest wizard walking the world, and your back hurts? Heal it as you healed mine, the time the tree fell on me. That took you all of five minutes, I believe.</q></p>

<p><q>Longer than that,</q> the man answered her. <q>You were delirious, you wouldn't remember.</q> He touched her hair, which was thick and pretty, even though it was mostly gray. <q>You know how I am about that,</q> he said. <q>I still like being mortal too much to use magic on myself. It spoils it somehow&#8212;it dulls the feeling. I've told you before.</q></p>

<p>The woman said <q><i>Mmphh,</i></q> the way I've heard my mother say it a thousand times. <q>Well, <i>I've</i> been mortal all my life, and some days&hellip;.</q></p>

<p>She didn't finish what she was saying, and the tall man smiled, the way you could tell he was teasing her. <q>Some days, what?</q></p>

<p><q>Nothing,</q> the woman said, <q>nothing, nothing.</q> She sounded irritable for a moment, but she put her hands on the man's arms, and she said in a different voice, <q>Some days&#8212;some early mornings&#8212;when the wind smells of blossoms I'll never see, and there are fawns playing in the misty orchards, and you're yawning and mumbling and scratching your head, and growling that we'll see rain before nightfall, and probably hail as well &hellip; on such mornings I wish with all my heart that we could both live forever, and I think you were a great fool to give it up.</q> She laughed again, but it sounded shaky now, a little. She said, <q>Then I remember things I'd rather not remember, so then my stomach acts up, and all sorts of other things start <i>twingeing</i> me&#8212;never mind what they are, or where they hurt, whether it's my body or my head, or my heart. And then I think, <i>no, I suppose not, maybe not.</i></q> The tall man put his arms around her, and for a moment she rested her head on his chest. I couldn't hear what she said after that.</p>

<p>I didn't think I'd made any noise, but the man raised his voice a little, not looking at me, not lifting his head, and he said, <q>Child, there's food here.</q> First I couldn't move, I was so frightened. He <i>couldn't</i> have seen me through the brush and all the alder trees. And then I started remembering how hungry I was, and I started toward them without knowing I was doing it. I actually looked down at my feet and watched them moving like somebody else's feet, as though they were the hungry ones, only they had to have me take them to the food. The man and the woman stood very still and waited for me.</p>

<p>Close to, the woman looked younger than her voice, and the tall man looked older. No, that isn't it, that's not what I mean. She wasn't young at all, but the gray hair made her face younger, and she held herself really straight, like the lady who comes when people in our village are having babies. She holds her face all stiff too, that one, and I don't like her much. This woman's face wasn't beautiful, I suppose, but it was a face you'd want to snuggle up to on a cold night. That's the best I know how to say it.</p>

<p>The man &hellip; one minute he looked younger than my father, and the next he'd be looking older than anybody I ever saw, older than people are supposed to <i>be</i>, maybe. He didn't have any gray hair himself, but he did have a lot of lines, but that's not what I'm talking about either. It was the eyes. His eyes were green, green, <i>green</i>, not like grass, not like emeralds&#8212;I saw an emerald once, a gypsy woman showed me&#8212;and not anything like apples or limes or such stuff. Maybe like the ocean, except I've never seen the ocean, so I don't know. If you go deep enough into the woods (not the Midwood, of course not, but any other sort of woods), sooner or later you'll always come to a place where even the <i>shadows</i> are green, and that's the way his eyes were. I was afraid of his eyes at first.</p>

<p>The woman gave me a peach and watched me bite into it, too hungry to thank her. She asked me, <q>Girl, what are you doing here? Are you lost?</q></p>

<p><q>No, I'm not,</q> I mumbled with my mouth full. <q>I just don't know where I am, that's different.</q> They both laughed, but it wasn't a mean, making-fun laugh. I told them, <q>My name's Sooz, and I have to see the king. He lives somewhere right nearby, doesn't he?</q></p>

<p>They looked at each other. I couldn't tell what they were thinking, but the tall man raised his eyebrows, and the woman shook her head a bit, slowly. They looked at each other for a long time, until the woman said, <q>Well, not nearby, but not so very far, either. We were bound on our way to visit him ourselves.</q></p>

<p><q>Good,</q> I said. <q>Oh, <i>good.</i></q> I was trying to sound as grown-up as they were, but it was hard, because I was so happy to find out that they could take me to the king. I said, <q>I'll go along with you, then.</q></p>

<p>The woman was against it before I got the first words out. She said to the tall man, <q>No, we couldn't. We don't know how things are.</q> She looked sad about it, but she looked firm, too. She said, <q>Girl, it's not you worries me. The king is a good man, and an old friend, but it has been a long time, and kings change. Even more than other people, kings change.</q></p>

<p><q>I have to see him,</q> I said. <q>You go on, then. I'm not going home until I see him.</q> I finished the peach, and the man handed me a chunk of dried fish and smiled at the woman as I tore into it. He said quietly to her, <q>It seems to me that you and I both remember asking to be taken along on a quest. I can't speak for you, but I begged.</q></p>

<p>But the woman wouldn't let up. <q>We could be bringing her into great peril. You can't take the chance, it isn't right!</q></p>

<p>He began to answer her, but I interrupted&#8212;my mother would have slapped me halfway across the kitchen. I shouted at them, <q>I'm <i>coming</i> from great peril. There's a griffin nested in the Midwood, and he's eaten Jehane and Louli and&#8212;and my Felicitas&#8212;</q> and then I <i>did</i> start weeping, and I didn't care. I just stood there and shook and wailed, and dropped the dried fish. I tried to pick it up, still crying so hard I couldn't see it, but the woman stopped me and gave me her scarf to dry my eyes and blow my nose. It smelled nice.</p>

<p><q>Child,</q> the tall man kept saying, <q>child, don't take on so, we didn't know about the griffin.</q> The woman was holding me against her side, smoothing my hair and glaring at him as though it was his fault that I was howling like that. She said, <q>Of course we'll take you with us, girl dear&#8212;there, never mind, of course we will. That's a fearful matter, a griffin, but the king will know what to do about it. The king eats griffins for breakfast snacks&#8212;spreads them on toast with orange marmalade and gobbles them up, I promise you.</q> And so on, being silly, but making me feel better, while the man went on pleading with me not to cry. I finally stopped when he pulled a big red handkerchief out of his pocket, twisted and knotted it into a bird-shape, and made it fly away. Uncle Ambrose does tricks with coins and shells, but he can't do anything like that.</p>

<p>His name was Schmendrick, which I still think is the funniest name I've heard in my life. The woman's name was Molly Grue. We didn't leave right away, because of the horses, but made camp where we were instead. I was waiting for the man, Schmendrick, to do it by magic, but he only built a fire, set out their blankets, and drew water from the stream like anyone else, while she hobbled the horses and put them to graze. I gathered firewood.</p>

<p>The woman, Molly, told me that the king's name was Lir, and that they had known him when he was a very young man, before he became king. <q>He is a true hero,</q> she said, <q>a dragonslayer, a giantkiller, a rescuer of maidens, a solver of impossible riddles. He may be the greatest hero of all, because he's a good man as well. They aren't always.</q></p>

<p><q>But you didn't want me to meet him,</q> I said. <q>Why was that?</q></p>

<p>Molly sighed. We were sitting under a tree, watching the sun go down, and she was brushing things out of my hair. She said, <q>He's old now. Schmendrick has trouble with time&#8212;I'll tell you why one day, it's a long story&#8212;and he doesn't understand that Lir may no longer be the man he was. It could be a sad reunion.</q> She started braiding my hair around my head, so it wouldn't get in the way. <q>I've had an unhappy feeling about this journey from the beginning, Sooz. But <i>he</i> took a notion that Lir needed us, so here we are. You can't argue with him when he gets like that.</q></p>

<p><q>A good wife isn't supposed to argue with her husband,</q> I said. <q>My mother says you wait until he goes out, or he's asleep, and then you do what you want.</q></p>

<p>Molly laughed, that rich, funny sound of hers, like a kind of deep gurgle. <q>Sooz, I've only known you a few hours, but I'd bet every penny I've got right now&#8212;aye, and all of Schmendrick's too&#8212;that you'll be arguing on your wedding night with whomever you marry. Anyway, Schmendrick and I aren't married. We're together, that's all. We've been together quite a long while.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh,</q> I said. I didn't know any people who were together like that, not the way she said it. <q>Well, you <i>look</i> married. You sort of do.</q></p>

<p>Molly's face didn't change, but she put an arm around my shoulders and hugged me close for a moment. She whispered in my ear, <q>I wouldn't marry him if he were the last man in the world. He eats wild radishes in bed. <i>Crunch, crunch, crunch,</i> all night&#8212;<i>crunch, crunch, crunch</i>.</q> I giggled, and the tall man looked over at us from where he was washing a pan in the stream. The last of the sunlight was on him, and those green eyes were bright as new leaves. One of them winked at me, and I <i>felt</i> it, the way you feel a tiny breeze on your skin when it's hot. Then he went back to scrubbing the pan.</p>

<p><q>Will it take us long to reach the king?</q> I asked her. <q>You said he didn't live too far, and I'm scared the griffin will eat somebody else while I'm gone. I need to be home.</q></p>

<p>Molly finished with my hair and gave it a gentle tug in back to bring my head up and make me look straight into her eyes. They were as gray as Schmendrick's were green, and I already knew that they turned darker or lighter gray depending on her mood. <q>What do you expect to happen when you meet King Lir, Sooz?</q> she asked me right back. <q>What did you have in mind when you set off to find him?</q></p>

<p>I was surprised. <q>Well, I'm going to get him to come back to my village with me. All those knights he keeps sending aren't doing any good at all, so he'll just have to take care of that griffin himself. He's the king. It's his job.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> Molly said, but she said it so softly I could barely hear her. She patted my arm once, lightly, and then she got up and walked away to sit by herself near the fire. She made it look as though she was banking the fire, but she wasn't really.</p>

<p>We started out early the next morning. Molly had me in front of her on her horse for a time, but by and by Schmendrick took me up on his, to spare the other one's sore foot. He was more comfortable to lean against than I'd expected&#8212;bony in some places, nice and springy in others. He didn't talk much, but he sang a lot as we went along, sometimes in languages I couldn't make out a word of, sometimes making up silly songs to make me laugh, like this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Soozli, Soozli,<br />
speaking loozli,<br />
you disturb my oozli-goozli.<br />
Soozli, Soozli,<br />
would you choozli<br />
to become my squoozli-squoozli?</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He didn't do anything magic, except maybe once, when a crow kept diving at the horse&#8212;out of meanness; that's all, there wasn't a nest anywhere&#8212;making the poor thing dance and shy and skitter until I almost fell off. Schmendrick finally turned in the saddle and <i>looked</i> at it, and the next minute a hawk came swooping out of nowhere and chased that crow screaming into a thornbush where the hawk couldn't follow. I guess that was magic.</p>

<p>It was actually pretty country we were passing through, once we got onto the proper road. Trees, meadows, little soft valleys, hillsides covered with wildflowers I didn't know. You could see they got a lot more rain here than we do where I live. It's a good thing sheep don't need grazing, the way cows do. They'll go where the goats go, and goats will go anywhere. We're like that in my village, we have to be. But I liked this land better.</p>

<p>Schmendrick told me it hadn't always been like that. <q>Before Lir, this was all barren desert where nothing grew&#8212;<i>nothing,</i> Sooz. It was said that the country was under a curse, and in a way it was, but I'll tell you about that another time.</q> People <i>always</i> say that when you're a child, and I hate it. <q>But Lir changed everything. The land was so glad to see him that it began blooming and blossoming the moment he became king, and it has done so ever since. Except poor Hagsgate, but that's another story too.</q> His voice got slower and deeper when he talked about Hagsgate, as though he weren't talking to me.</p>

<p>I twisted my neck around to look up at him. <q>Do you think King Lir will come back with me and kill that griffin? I think Molly thinks he won't, because he's so old.</q> I hadn't known I was worried about that until I actually said it.</p>

<p><q>Why, of course he will, girl.</q> Schmendrick winked at me again. <q>He never could resist the plea of a maiden in distress, the more difficult and dangerous the deed, the better. If he did not spur to your village's aid himself at the first call, it was surely because he was engaged on some other heroic venture. I'm as certain as I can be that as soon as you make your request&#8212;remember to curtsey properly&#8212;he'll snatch up his great sword and spear, whisk you up to his saddlebow, and be off after your griffin with the road smoking behind him. Young or old, that's always been his way.</q> He rumpled my hair in the back. <q>Molly overworries. That's <i>her</i> way. We are who we are.</q></p>

<p><q>What's a curtsey?</q> I asked him. I know now, because Molly showed me, but I didn't then. He didn't laugh, except with his eyes, then gestured for me to face forward again as he went back to singing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Soozli, Soozli,<br />
you amuse me,<br />
right down to my solesli-shoesli.<br />
Soozli, Soozli,<br />
I bring newsli&#8212;<br />
we could wed next stewsli-Tuesli.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I learned that the king had lived in a castle on a cliff by the sea when he was young, less than a day's journey from Hagsgate, but it fell down&#8212;Schmendrick wouldn't tell me how&#8212;so he built a new one somewhere else. I was sorry about that, because I've never seen the sea, and I've always wanted to, and I still haven't. But I'd never seen a castle, either, so there was that. I leaned back against his chest and fell asleep.</p>

<p>They'd been traveling slowly, taking time to let Molly's horse heal, but once its hoof was all right we galloped most of the rest of the way. Those horses of theirs didn't look magic or special, but they could run for hours without getting tired, and when I helped to rub them down and curry them, they were hardly sweating. They slept on their sides, like people, not standing up, the way our horses do.</p>

<p>Even so, it took us three full days to reach King Lir. Molly said he had bad memories of the castle that fell down, so that was why this one was as far from the sea as he could make it, and as different from the old one. It was on a hill, so the king could see anyone coming along the road, but there wasn't a moat, and there weren't any guards in armor, and there was only one banner on the walls. It was blue, with a picture of a white unicorn on it. Nothing else.</p>

<p>I was disappointed. I tried not to show it, but Molly saw. <q>You wanted a fortress,</q> she said to me gently. <q>You were expecting dark stone towers, flags and cannons and knights, trumpeters blowing from the battlements. I'm sorry. It being your first castle, and all.</q></p>

<p><q>No, it's a <i>pretty</i> castle,</q> I said. And it <i>was</i> pretty, sitting peacefully on its hilltop in the sunlight, surrounded by all those wildflowers. There was a marketplace, I could see now, and there were huts like ours snugged up against the castle walls, so that the people could come inside for protection, if they needed to. I said, <q>Just looking at it, you can see that the king is a nice man.</q></p>

<p>Molly was looking at me with her head a little bit to one side. She said, <q>He is a hero, Sooz. Remember that, whatever else you see, whatever you think. Lir is a hero.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, I know <i>that,</i></q> I said. <q>I'm sure he'll help me. I am.</q></p>

<p>But I wasn't. The moment I saw that nice, friendly castle, I wasn't a bit sure.</p>

<p>We didn't have any trouble getting in. The gate simply opened when Schmendrick knocked once, and he and Molly and I walked in through the market, where people were selling all kinds of fruits and vegetables, pots and pans and clothing and so on, the way they do in our village. They all called to us to come over to their barrows and buy things, but nobody tried to stop us going into the castle. There were two men at the two great doors, and they did ask us our names and why we wanted to see King Lir. The moment Schmendrick told them his name, they stepped back quickly and let us by, so I began to think that maybe he actually was a great magician, even if I never saw him do anything but little tricks and little songs. The men didn't offer to take him to the king, and he didn't ask.</p>

<p>Molly was right. I <i>was</i> expecting the castle to be all cold and shadowy, with queens looking sideways at us, and big men clanking by in armor. But the halls we followed Schmendrick through were full of sunlight from long, high windows, and the people we saw mostly nodded and smiled at us. We passed a stone stair curling up out of sight, and I was sure that the king must live at the top, but Schmendrick never looked at it. He led us straight through the great hall&#8212;they had a fireplace big enough to roast three cows!&#8212;and on past the kitchens and the scullery and the laundry, to a room under another stair. <i>That</i> was dark. You wouldn't have found it unless you knew where to look. Schmendrick didn't knock at that door, and he didn't say anything magic to make it open. He just stood outside and waited, and by and by it rattled open, and we went in.</p>

<p>The king was in there. All by himself, the king was in there.</p>

<p>He was sitting on an ordinary wooden chair, not a throne. It was a really small room, the same size as my mother's weaving room, so maybe that's why he looked so big. He was as tall as Schmendrick, but he seemed so much <i>wider</i>. I was ready for him to have a long beard, spreading out all across his chest, but he only had a short one, like my father, except white. He wore a red and gold mantle, and there was a real golden crown on his white head, not much bigger than the wreaths we put on our champion rams at the end of the year. He had a kind face, with a big old nose, and big blue eyes, like a little boy. But his eyes were so tired and heavy, I didn't know how he kept them open. Sometimes he didn't. There was nobody else in the little room, and he peered at the three of us as though he knew he knew us, but not <i>why</i>. He tried to smile.</p>

<p>Schmendrick said very gently, <q>Majesty, it is Schmendrick and Molly, Molly Grue.</q> The king blinked at him.</p>

<p><q>Molly with the cat,</q> Molly whispered. <q>You remember the cat, Lir.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> the king said. It seemed to take him forever to speak that one word. <q>The cat, yes, of course.</q> But he didn't say anything after that, and we stood there and stood there, and the king kept smiling at something I couldn't see.</p>

<p>Schmendrick said to Molly, <q><i>She</i> used to forget herself like that.</q> His voice had changed, the same way it changed when he was talking about the way the land used to be. He said, <q>And then you would always remind her that she was a unicorn.</q></p>

<p>And the king changed too then. All at once his eyes were clear and shining with feeling, like Molly's eyes, and he <i>saw</i> us for the first time. He said softly, <q>Oh, my friends!</q> and he stood up and came to us and put his arms around Schmendrick and Molly. And I saw that he had been a hero, and that he was still a hero, and I began to think it might be all right, after all. Maybe it was really going to be all right.</p>

<p><q>And who may this princess be?</q> he asked, looking straight at me. He had the proper voice for a king, deep and strong, but not frightening, not mean. I tried to tell him my name, but I couldn't make a sound, so he actually knelt on one knee in front of me, and he took my hand. He said, <q>I have often been of some use to princesses in distress. Command me.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not a princess, I'm Sooz,</q> I said, <q>and I'm from a village you wouldn't even know, and there's a griffin eating the children.</q> It all tumbled out like that, in one breath, but he didn't laugh or look at me any differently. What he did was ask me the name of my village, and I told him, and he said, <q>But indeed I know it, madam. I have been there. And now I will have the pleasure of returning.</q></p>

<p>Over his shoulder I saw Schmendrick and Molly staring at each other. Schmendrick was about to say something, but then they both turned toward the door, because a small dark woman, about my mother's age, only dressed in tunic, trews and boots like Molly, had just come in. She said in a small, worried voice, <q>I am so truly sorry that I was not here to greet His Majesty's old companions. No need to tell me your illustrious names&#8212;my own is Lisene, and I am the king's royal secretary, translator, and protector.</q> She took King Lir's arm, very politely and carefully, and began moving him back to his chair.</p>

<p>Schmendrick seemed to take a minute getting his own breath back. He said, <q>I have never known my old friend Lir to need any of those services. Especially a protector.</q></p>

<p>Lisene was busy with the king and didn't look at Schmendrick as she answered him. <q>How long has it been since you saw him last?</q> Schmendrick didn't answer. Lisene's voice was quiet still, but not so nervous. <q>Time sets its claw in us all, my lord, sooner or later. We are none of us that which we were.</q> King Lir sat down obediently on his chair and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>I could tell that Schmendrick was angry, and growing angrier as he stood there, but he didn't show it. My father gets angry like that, which is how I knew. He said, <q>His Majesty has agreed to return to this young person's village with her, in order to rid her people of a marauding griffin. We will start out tomorrow.</q></p>

<p>Lisene swung around on us so fast that I was sure she was going to start shouting and giving everybody orders. But she didn't do anything like that. You could never have told that she was the least bit annoyed or alarmed. All she said was, <q>I am afraid that will not be possible, my lord. The king is in no fit condition for such a journey, nor certainly for such a deed.</q></p>

<p><q>The king thinks rather differently.</q> Schmendrick was talking through clenched teeth now.</p>

<p><q>Does he, then?</q> Lisene pointed at King Lir, and I saw that he had fallen asleep in his chair. His head was drooping&#8212;I was afraid his crown was going to fall off&#8212;and his mouth hung open. Lisene said, <q>You came seeking the peerless warrior you remember, and you have found a spent, senile old man. Believe me, I understand your distress, but you must see&#8212;</q></p>

<p>Schmendrick cut her off. I never understood what people meant when they talked about someone's eyes actually flashing, but at least green eyes can do it. He looked even taller than he was, and when he pointed a finger at Lisene I honestly expected the small woman to catch fire or maybe melt away. Schmendrick's voice was especially frightening because it was so quiet. He said, <q>Hear me now. I am Schmendrick the Magician, and I see my old friend Lir, as I have always seen him, wise and powerful and good, beloved of a unicorn.</q></p>

<p>And with that word, for a second time, the king woke up. He blinked once, then gripped the arms of the chair and pushed himself to his feet. He didn't look at us, but at Lisene, and he said, <q>I will go with them. It is my task and my gift. You will see to it that I am made ready.</q></p>

<p>Lisene said, <q>Majesty, no! Majesty, I beg you !</q></p>

<p>King Lir reached out and took Lisene's head between his big hands, and I saw that there was love between them. He said, <q>It is what I am for. You know that as well as <i>he</i> does. See to it, Lisene, and keep all well for me while I am gone.</q></p>

<p>Lisene looked so sad, so <i>lost</i>, that I didn't know what to think, about her or King Lir or anything. I didn't realize that I had moved back against Molly Grue until I felt her hand in my hair. She didn't say anything, but it was nice smelling her there. Lisene said, very quietly, <q>I will see to it.</q></p>

<p>She turned around then and started for the door with her head lowered. I think she wanted to pass us by without looking at us at all, but she couldn't do it. Right at the door, her head came up and she stared at Schmendrick so hard that I pushed into Molly's skirt so I couldn't see her eyes. I heard her say, as though she could barely make the words come out, <q>His death be on your head, magician.</q> I think she was crying, only not, the way grown people do.</p>

<p>And I heard Schmendrick's answer, and his voice was so cold I wouldn't have recognized it if I didn't know. <q>He has died before. Better that death&#8212;better this, better <i>any</i> death&#8212;than the one he was dying in that chair. If the griffin kills him, it will yet have saved his life.</q> I heard the door close.</p>

<p>I asked Molly, speaking as low as I could, <q>What did he mean, about the king having died?</q> But she put me to one side, and she went to King Lir and knelt in front of him, reaching up to take one of his hands between hers. She said, <q>Lord &hellip; Majesty &hellip; friend &hellip; dear friend&#8212;remember. Oh, please, please <i>remember</i>.</q></p>

<p>The old man was swaying on his feet, but he put his other hand on Molly's head and he mumbled, <q>Child, Sooz&#8212;is that your pretty name, Sooz?&#8212;of course I will come to your village. The griffin was never hatched that dares harm King Lir's people.</q> He sat down hard in the chair again, but he held onto her hand tightly. He looked at her, with his blue eyes wide and his mouth trembling a little. He said, <q>But you must remind me, little one. When I &hellip; when I lose myself&#8212;when I lose <i>her</i>&#8212;you must remind me that I am still searching, still waiting &hellip; that I have never forgotten her, never turned from all she taught me. I sit in this place &hellip; I <i>sit</i> &hellip; because a king has to sit, you see &hellip; but in my mind, in my poor mind, I am always away with <i>her&hellip;. </i></q></p>

<p>I didn't have any idea what he was talking about. I do now.</p>

<p>He fell asleep again then, holding Molly's hand. She sat with him for a long time, resting her head on his knee. Schmendrick went off to make sure Lisene was doing what she was supposed to do, getting everything ready for the king's departure. There was a lot of clattering and shouting already, enough so you'd have thought a war was starting, but nobody came in to see King Lir or speak to him, wish him luck or anything. It was almost as though he wasn't really there.</p>

<p>Me, I tried to write a letter home, with pictures of the king and the castle, but I fell asleep like him, and I slept the rest of that day and all night too. I woke up in a bed I couldn't remember getting into, with Schmendrick looking down at me, saying, <q>Up, child, on your feet. You started all this uproar&#8212;it's time for you to see it through. The king is coming to slay your griffin.</q></p>

<p>I was out of bed before he'd finished speaking. I said, <q>Now? Are we going right now?</q></p>

<p>Schmendrick shrugged his shoulders. <q>By noon, anyway, if I can finally get Lisene and the rest of them to understand that they are <i>not</i> coming. Lisene wants to bring fifty men-at-arms, a dozen wagonloads of supplies, a regiment of runners to send messages back and forth, and every wretched physician in the kingdom.</q> He sighed and spread his hands. <q>I may have to turn the lot of them to stone if we are to be off today.</q></p>

<p>I thought he was probably joking, but I already knew that you couldn't be sure with Schmendrick. He said, <q>If Lir comes with a train of followers, there will be no Lir. Do you understand me, Sooz?</q> I shook my head. Schmendrick said, <q>It is my fault. If I had made sure to visit here more often, there were things I could have done to restore the Lir Molly and I once knew. My fault, my thoughtlessness.</q></p>

<p>I remembered Molly telling me, <q>Schmendrick has trouble with time.</q> I still didn't know what she meant, nor this either. I said, <q>It's just the way old people get. We have old men in our village who talk like him. One woman, too, Mam Jennet. She always cries when it rains.</q></p>

<p>Schmendrick clenched his fist and pounded it against his leg. <q>King Lir is <i>not</i> mad, girl, nor is he senile, as Lisene called him. He is <i>Lir,</i> Lir still, I promise you that. It is only here, in this castle, surrounded by good, loyal people who love him&#8212;who will love him to death, if they are allowed&#8212;that he sinks into &hellip; into the condition you have seen.</q> He didn't say anything more for a moment; then he stooped a little to peer closely at me. <q>Did you notice the change in him when I spoke of unicorns?</q></p>

<p><q>Unicorn,</q> I answered. <q>One unicorn who loved him. I noticed.</q></p>

<p>Schmendrick kept looking at me in a new way, as though we'd never met before. He said, <q>Your pardon, Sooz. I keep taking you for a child. Yes. One unicorn. He has not seen her since he became king, but he is what he is because of her. And when I speak that word, when Molly or I say her name&#8212;which I have not done yet&#8212;then he is recalled to himself.</q> He paused for a moment, and then added, very softly, <q>As we had so often to do for her, so long ago.</q></p>

<p><q>I didn't know unicorns had names,</q> I said. <q>I didn't know they ever loved people.</q></p>

<p><q>They don't. Only this one.</q> He turned and walked away swiftly, saying over his shoulder, <q>Her name was Amalthea. Go find Molly, she'll see you fed.</q></p>

<p>The room I'd slept in wasn't big, not for something in a castle. Catania, the headwoman of our village, has a bedroom nearly as large, which I know because I play with her daughter Sophia. But the sheets I'd been under were embroidered with a crown, and engraved on the headboard was a picture of the blue banner with the white unicorn. I had slept the night in King Lir's own bed while he dozed in an old wooden chair.</p>

<p>I didn't wait to have breakfast with Molly, but ran straight to the little room where I had last seen the king. He was there, but so changed that I froze in the doorway, trying to get my breath. Three men were bustling around him like tailors, dressing him in his armor: all the padding underneath, first, and then the different pieces for the arms and legs and shoulders. I don't know any of the names. The men hadn't put his helmet on him, so his head stuck out at the top, white-haired and big-nosed and blue-eyed, but he didn't look silly like that. He looked like a giant.</p>

<p>When he saw me, he smiled, and it was a warm, happy smile, but it was a little frightening too, almost a little terrible, like the time I saw the griffin burning in the black sky. It was a hero's smile. I'd never seen one before. He called to me, <q>Little one, come and buckle on my sword, if you would. It would be an honor for me.</q></p>

<p>The men had to show me how you do it. The swordbelt, all by itself, was so heavy it kept slipping through my fingers, and I did need help with the buckle. But I put the sword into its sheath alone, although I needed both hands to lift it. When it slid home it made a sound like a great door slamming shut. King Lir touched my face with one of his cold iron gloves and said, <q>Thank you, little one. The next time that blade is drawn, it will be to free your village. You have my word.</q></p>

<p>Schmendrick came in then, took one look, and just shook his head. He said, <q>This is the most ridiculous &hellip; It is four days&#8217; ride&#8212;perhaps five&#8212;with the weather turning hot enough to broil a lobster on an iceberg. There's no need for armor until he faces the griffin.</q> You could see how stupid he felt they all were, but King Lir smiled at him the same way he'd smiled at me, and Schmendrick stopped talking.</p>

<p>King Lir said, <q>Old friend, I go forth as I mean to return. It is my way.</q></p>

<p>Schmendrick looked like a little boy himself for a moment. All he could say was, <q>Your business. Don't blame me, that's all. At <i>least</i> leave the helmet off.</q></p>

<p>He was about to turn away and stalk out of the room, but Molly came up behind him and said, <q>Oh, Majesty&#8212;Lir&#8212;how grand! How beautiful you are!</q> She sounded the way my Aunt Zerelda sounds when she's carrying on about my brother Wilfrid. He could mess his pants and jump in a hog pen, and Aunt Zerelda would still think he was the best, smartest boy in the whole world. But Molly was different. She brushed those tailors, or whatever they were, straight aside, and she stood on tiptoe to smooth King Lir's white hair, and I heard her whisper, <q>I wish <i>she</i> could see you.</q></p>

<p>King Lir looked at her for a long time without saying anything. Schmendrick stood there, off to the side, and he didn't say anything either, but they were together, the three of them. I wish that Felicitas and I could have been together like that when we got old. Could have had time. Then King Lir looked at <i>me</i>, and he said, <q>The child is waiting.</q> And that's how we set off for home. The king, Schmendrick, Molly, and me.</p>

<p>To the last minute, poor old Lisene kept trying to get King Lir to take some knights or soldiers with him. She actually followed us on foot when we left, calling, <q>Highness&#8212;Majesty&#8212;if you will have none else, take me! Take me!</q> At that the king stopped and turned and went back to her. He got down off his horse and embraced Lisene, and I don't know what they said to each other, but Lisene didn't follow anymore after that.</p>

<p>I rode with the king most of the time, sitting up in front of him on his skittery black mare. I wasn't sure I could trust her not to bite me, or to kick me when I wasn't looking, but King Lir told me, <q>It is only peaceful times that make her nervous, be assured of that. When dragons charge her, belching death&#8212;for the fumes are more dangerous than the flames, little one&#8212;when your griffin swoops down at her, you will see her at her best.</q> I still didn't like her much, but I did like the king. He didn't sing to me, the way Schmendrick had, but he told me stories, and they weren't fables or fairytales. These were real, true stories, and he knew they were true because they had all happened to him! I never heard stories like those, and I never will again. I know that for certain.</p>

<p>He told me more things to keep in mind if you have to fight a dragon, and he told me how he learned that ogres aren't always as stupid as they look, and why you should never swim in a mountain pool when the snows are melting, and how you can <i>sometimes</i> make friends with a troll. He talked about his father's castle, where he grew up, and about how he met Schmendrick and Molly there, and even about Molly's cat, which he said was a little thing with a funny crooked ear. But when I asked him why the castle fell down, he wouldn't exactly say, no more than Schmendrick would. His voice became very quiet and faraway. <q>I forget things, you know, little one,</q> he said. <q>I try to hold on, but I do forget.</q></p>

<p>Well, I knew <i>that.</i> He kept calling Molly Sooz, and he never called me anything but <i>little one,</i> and Schmendrick kept having to remind him where we were bound and why. That was always at night, though. He was usually fine during the daytime. And when he did turn confused again, and wander off (not just in his mind, either&#8212;I found him in the woods one night, talking to a tree as though it was his father), all you had to do was mention a white unicorn named Amalthea, and he'd come to himself almost right away. Generally it was Schmendrick who did that, but I brought him back that time, holding my hand and telling me how you can recognize a pooka, and why you need to. But I could never get him to say a word about the unicorn.</p>

<p>Autumn comes early where I live. The days were still hot, and the king never would take his armor off, except to sleep, not even his helmet with the big blue plume on top, but at night I burrowed in between Molly and Schmendrick for warmth, and you could hear the stags belling everywhere all the time, crazy with the season. One of them actually charged King Lir's horse while I was riding with him, and Schmendrick was about to do something magic to the stag, the same way he'd done with the crow. But the king laughed and rode straight at him, right <i>into</i> those horns. I screamed, but the black mare never hesitated, and the stag turned at the last moment and ambled out of sight in the brush. He was wagging his tail in circles, the way goats do, and looking as puzzled and dreamy as King Lir himself.</p>

<p><i>I</i> was proud, once I got over being frightened. But both Schmendrick and Molly scolded him, and he kept apologizing to me for the rest of the day for having put me in danger, as Molly had once said he would. <q>I forgot you were with me, little one, and for that I will always ask your pardon.</q> Then he smiled at me with that beautiful, terrible hero's smile I'd seen before, and he said, <q>But oh, little one, the remembering!</q> And that night he didn't wander away and get himself lost. Instead he sat happily by the fire with us and sang a whole long song about the adventures of an outlaw called Captain Cully. I'd never heard of him, but it's a really good song.</p>

<p>We reached my village late on the afternoon of the fourth day, and Schmendrick made us stop together before we rode in. He said, directly to me, <q>Sooz, if you tell them that this is the king himself, there will be nothing but noise and joy and celebration, and nobody will get any rest with all that carrying-on. It would be best for you to tell them that we have brought King Lir's greatest knight with us, and that he needs a night to purify himself in prayer and meditation before he deals with your griffin.</q> He took hold of my chin and made me look into his green, green eyes, and he said, <q>Girl, you have to trust me. I always know what I'm doing&#8212;that's my trouble. Tell your people what I've said.</q> And Molly touched me and looked at me without saying anything, so I knew it was all right.</p>

<p>I left them camped on the outskirts of the village, and walked home by myself. Malka met me first. She smelled me before I even reached Simon and Elsie's tavern, and she came running and crashed into my legs and knocked me over, and then pinned me down with her paws on my shoulders, and kept licking my face until I had to nip her nose to make her let me up and run to the house with me. My father was out with the flock, but my mother and Wilfrid were there, and they grabbed me and nearly strangled me, and they cried over me&#8212;rotten, stupid Wilfrid too!&#8212;because everyone had been so certain that I'd been taken and eaten by the griffin. After that, once she got done crying, my mother spanked me for running off in Uncle Ambrose's cart without telling anyone, and when my father came in, he spanked me all over again. But I didn't mind.</p>

<p>I told them I'd seen King Lir in person, and been in his castle, and I said what Schmendrick had told me to say, but nobody was much cheered by it. My father just sat down and grunted, <q>Oh, aye&#8212;another great warrior for our comfort and the griffin's dessert. Your bloody king won't ever come here his bloody self, you can be sure of that.</q> My mother reproached him for talking like that in front of Wilfrid and me, but he went on, <q>Maybe he cared about places like this, people like us once, but he's old now, and old kings only care who's going to be king after them. You can't tell me anything different.</q></p>

<p>I wanted more than anything to tell him that King Lir <i>was</i> here, less than half a mile from our doorstep, but I didn't, and not only because Schmendrick had told me not to. I wasn't sure what the king might look like, white-haired and shaky and not here all the time, to people like my father. I wasn't sure what he looked like to me, for that matter. He was a lovely, dignified old man who told wonderful stories, but when I tried to imagine him riding alone into the Midwood to do battle with a griffin, a griffin that had already eaten his best knights &hellip; to be honest, I couldn't do it. Now that I'd actually brought him all the way home with me, as I'd set out to do, I was suddenly afraid that I'd drawn him to his death. And I knew I wouldn't ever forgive myself if that happened.</p>

<p>I wanted so much to see them that night, Schmendrick and Molly and the king. I wanted to sleep out there on the ground with them, and listen to their talk, and then maybe I'd not worry so much about the morning. But of course there wasn't a chance of that. My family would hardly let me out of their sight to wash my face. Wilfrid kept following me around, asking endless questions about the castle, and my father took me to Catania, who had me tell the whole story over again, and agreed with him that whomever the king had sent this time wasn't likely to be any more use than the others had been. And my mother kept feeding me and scolding me and hugging me, all more or less at the same time. And then, in the night, we heard the griffin, making that soft, lonely, horrible sound it makes when it's hunting. So I didn't get very much sleep, between one thing and another.</p>

<p>But at sunrise, after I'd helped Wilfrid milk the goats, they let me run out to the camp, as long as Malka came with me, which was practically like having my mother along. Molly was already helping King Lir into his armor, and Schmendrick was burying the remains of last night's dinner, as though they were starting one more ordinary day on their journey to somewhere. They greeted me, and Schmendrick thanked me for doing as he'd asked, so that the king could have a restful night before he&#8212;</p>

<p>I didn't let him finish. I didn't know I was going to do it, I swear, but I ran up to King Lir, and I threw my arms around him, and I said, <q>Don't go! I changed my mind, don't go!</q> Just like Lisene.</p>

<p>King Lir looked down at me. He seemed as tall as a tree right then, and he patted my head very gently with his iron glove. He said, <q>Little one, I have a griffin to slay. It is my job.</q></p>

<p>Which was what I'd said myself, though it seemed like years ago, and that made it so much worse. I said a second time, <q>I changed my mind! Somebody else can fight the griffin, you don't have to! You go home! You go home <i>now</i> and live your life, and be the king, and everything&hellip;.</q> I was babbling and sniffling, and generally being a baby, I know that. I'm glad Wilfrid didn't see me.</p>

<p>King Lir kept petting me with one hand and trying to put me aside with the other, but I wouldn't let go. I think I was actually trying to pull his sword out of its sheath, to take it away from him. He said, <q>No, no, little one, you don't understand. There are some monsters that only a king can kill. I have always known that&#8212;I should never, never have sent those poor men to die in my place. No one else in all the land can do this for you and your village. Most truly now, it is my job.</q> And he kissed my hand, the way he must have kissed the hands of so many queens. He kissed my hand too, just like theirs.</p>

<p>Molly came up then and took me away from him. She held me close, and she stroked my hair, and she told me, <q>Child, Sooz, there's no turning back for him now, or for you either. It was your fate to bring this last cause to him, and his fate to take it up, and neither of you could have done differently, being who you are. And now you must be as brave as he is, and see it all play out.</q> She caught herself there, and changed it. <q>Rather, you must wait to learn how it has played out, because you are certainly not coming into that forest with us.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm coming,</q> I said. <q>You can't stop me. Nobody can.</q> I wasn't sniffling or anything anymore. I said it like that, that's all.</p>

<p>Molly held me at arm's length, and she shook me a little bit. She said, <q>Sooz, if you can tell me that your parents have given their permission, then you may come. Have they done so?</q></p>

<p>I didn't answer her. She shook me again, gentler this time, saying, <q>Oh, that was wicked of me, forgive me, my dear friend. I knew the day we met that you could never learn to lie.</q> Then she took both of my hands between hers, and she said, <q>Lead us to the Midwood, if you will, Sooz, and we will say our farewells there. Will you do that for us? For me?</q></p>

<p>I nodded, but I still didn't speak. I couldn't, my throat was hurting so much. Molly squeezed my hands and said, <q>Thank you.</q> Schmendrick came up and made some kind of sign to her with his eyes, or his eyebrows, because she said, <q>Yes, I know,</q> although he hadn't said a thing. So she went to King Lir with him, and I was alone, trying to stop shaking. I managed it, after a while.</p>

<p>The Midwood isn't far. They wouldn't really have needed my help to find it. You can see the beginning of it from the roof of Ellis the baker's house, which is the tallest one on that side of the village. It's always dark, even from a distance, even if you're not actually in it. I don't know if that's because they're oak trees (we have all sorts of tales and sayings about oaken woods, and the creatures that live there) or maybe because of some enchantment, or because of the griffin. Maybe it was different before the griffin came. Uncle Ambrose says it's been a bad place all his life, but my father says no, he and his friends used to hunt there, and he actually picnicked there once or twice with my mother, when they were young.</p>

<p>King Lir rode in front, looking grand and almost young, with his head up and the blue plume on his helmet floating above him, more like a banner than a feather. I was going to ride with Molly, but the king leaned from his saddle as I started past, and swooped me up before him, saying, <q>You shall guide and company me, little one, until we reach the forest.</q> I was proud of that, but I was frightened too, because he was so happy, and I knew he was going to his death, trying to make up for all those knights he'd sent to fight the griffin. I didn't try to warn him. He wouldn't have heard me, and I knew that too. Me and poor old Lisene.</p>

<p>He told me all about griffins as we rode. He said, <q>If you should ever have dealings with a griffin, little one, you must remember that they are not like dragons. A dragon is simply a dragon&#8212;make yourself small when it dives down at you, but hold your ground and strike at the underbelly, and you've won the day. But a griffin, now &hellip; a griffin is two highly dissimilar creatures, eagle and lion, fused together by some god with a god's sense of humor. And so there is an eagle's heart beating in the beast, and a lion's heart as well, and you must pierce them both to have any hope of surviving the battle.</q> He was as cheerful as he could be about it all, holding me safe on the saddle, and saying over and over, the way old people do, <q>Two hearts, never forget that&#8212;many people do. Eagle heart, lion heart&#8212;eagle heart, lion heart. <i>Never</i> forget, little one.</q></p>

<p>We passed a lot of people I knew, out with their sheep and goats, and they all waved to me, and called, and made jokes, and so on. They cheered for King Lir, but they didn't bow to him, or take off their caps, because nobody recognized him, nobody knew. He seemed delighted about that, which most kings probably wouldn't be. But he's the only king I've met, so I can't say.</p>

<p>The Midwood seemed to be reaching out for us before we were anywhere near it, long fingery shadows stretching across the empty fields, and the leaves flickering and blinking, though there wasn't any wind. A forest is usually really noisy, day and night, if you stand still and listen to the birds and the insects and the streams and such, but the Midwood is always silent, silent. That reaches out too, the silence.</p>

<p>We halted a stone's throw from the forest, and King Lir said to me, <q>We part here, little one,</q> and set me down on the ground as carefully as though he was putting a bird back in its nest. He said to Schmendrick, <q>I know better than to try to keep you and Sooz from following&#8212;</q> he kept on calling Molly by my name, every time, I don't know why&#8212;<q>but I enjoin you, in the name of great Nikos himself, and in the name of our long and precious friendship&hellip;.</q> He stopped there, and he didn't say anything more for such a while that I was afraid he was back to forgetting who he was and why he was there, the way he had been. But then he went on, clear and ringing as one of those mad stags, <q>I charge you in <i>her</i> name, in the name of the Lady Amalthea, not to assist me in any way from the moment we pass the very first tree, but to leave me altogether to what is mine to do. Is that understood between us, dear ones of my heart?</q></p>

<p>Schmendrick hated it. You didn't have to be magic to see that. It was so plain, even to me, that he had been planning to take over the battle as soon as they were actually facing the griffin. But King Lir was looking right at him with those young blue eyes, and with a little bit of a smile on his face, and Schmendrick simply didn't know what to do. There wasn't anything he <i>could</i> do, so he finally nodded and mumbled, <q>If that is Your Majesty's wish.</q> The king couldn't hear him at all the first time, so he made him say it again.</p>

<p>And then, of course, everybody had to say goodbye to me, since I wasn't allowed to go any further with them. Molly said she knew we'd see each other again, and Schmendrick told me that I had the makings of a real warrior queen, only he was certain I was too smart to be one. And King Lir &hellip; King Lir said to me, very quietly, so nobody else could hear, <q>Little one, if I had married and had a daughter, I would have asked no more than that she should be as brave and kind and loyal as you. Remember that, as I will remember you to my last day.</q></p>

<p>Which was all nice, and I wished my mother and father could have heard what all these grown people were saying about me. But then they turned and rode on into the Midwood, the three of them, and only Molly looked back at me. And I think <i>that</i> was to make sure I wasn't following, because I was supposed just to go home and wait to find out if my friends were alive or dead, and if the griffin was going to be eating any more children. It was all over.</p>

<p>And maybe I would have gone home and let it be all over, if it hadn't been for Malka.</p>

<p>She should have been with the sheep and not with me, of course&#8212;that's her job, the same way King Lir was doing his job, going to meet the griffin. But Malka thinks I'm a sheep too, the most stupid, aggravating sheep she ever had to guard, forever wandering away into some kind of danger. All the way to the Midwood she had trotted quietly alongside the king's horse, but now that we were alone again she came rushing up and bounced all over me, barking like thunder and knocking me down, hard, the way she does whenever I'm not where she wants me to be. I always brace myself when I see her coming, but it never helps.</p>

<p>What she does then, before I'm on my feet, is take the hem of my smock in her jaws and start tugging me in the direction she thinks I should go. But this time &hellip; this time she suddenly got up, as though she'd forgotten all about me, and she stared past me at the Midwood with all the white showing in her eyes and a low sound coming out of her that I don't think she knew she could make. The next moment, she was gone, racing into the forest with foam flying from her mouth and her big ragged ears flat back. I called, but she couldn't have heard me, baying and barking the way she was.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't have any choice. King Lir and Schmendrick and Molly all had a choice, going after the Midwood griffin, but Malka was my dog, and she didn't know what she was facing, and I <i>couldn't</i> let her face it by herself. So there wasn't anything else for me to do. I took an enormous long breath and looked around me, and then I walked into the forest after her.</p>

<p>Actually, I ran, as long as I could, and then I walked until I could run again, and then I ran some more. There aren't any paths into the Midwood, because nobody goes there, so it wasn't hard to see where three horses had pushed through the undergrowth, and then a dog's tracks on top of the hoofprints. It was very quiet with no wind, not one bird calling, no sound but my own panting. I couldn't even hear Malka anymore. I was hoping that maybe they'd come on the griffin while it was asleep, and King Lir had already killed it in its nest. I didn't think so, though. He'd probably have decided it wasn't honorable to attack a sleeping griffin, and wakened it up for a fair fight. I hadn't known him very long, but I knew what he'd do.</p>

<p>Then, a little way ahead of me, the whole forest exploded.</p>

<p>It was too much noise for me to sort it out in my head. There was Malka absolutely <i>howling</i>, and birds bursting up everywhere out of the brush, and Schmendrick or the king or someone was shouting, only I couldn't make out any of the words. And underneath it all was something that wasn't loud at all, a sound somewhere between a growl and that terrible soft call, like a frightened child. Then&#8212;just as I broke into the clearing&#8212;the rattle and scrape of knives, only much louder this time, as the griffin shot straight up with the sun on its wings. Its cold golden eyes <i>bit</i> into mine, and its beak was open so wide you could see down and down the blazing red gullet. It filled the sky.</p>

<p>And King Lir, astride his black mare, filled the clearing. He was as huge as the griffin, and his sword was the size of a boar spear, and he shook it at the griffin, daring it to light down and fight him on the ground. But the griffin was staying out of range, circling overhead to get a good look at these strange new people. Malka was utterly off her head, screaming and hurling herself into the air again and again, snapping at the griffin's lion feet and eagle claws, but coming down each time without so much as an iron feather between her teeth. I lunged and caught her in the air, trying to drag her away before the griffin turned on her, but she fought me, scratching my face with her own dull dog claws, until I had to let her go. The last time she leaped, the griffin suddenly stooped and caught her full on her side with one huge wing, so hard that she couldn't get a sound out, no more than I could. She flew all the way across the clearing, slammed into a tree, fell to the ground, and after that she didn't move.</p>

<p>Molly told me later that that was when King Lir struck for the griffin's lion heart. I didn't see it. I was flying across the clearing myself, throwing myself over Malka, in case the griffin came after her again, and I didn't see anything except her staring eyes and the blood on her side. But I did hear the griffin's roar when it happened, and when I could turn my head, I saw the blood splashing along <i>its</i> side, and the back legs squinching up against its belly, the way you do when you're really hurting. King Lir shouted like a boy. He threw that great sword as high as the griffin, and snatched it back again, and then he charged toward the griffin as it wobbled lower and lower, with its crippled lion half dragging it out of the air. It landed with a saggy thump, just like Malka, and there was a moment when I was absolutely sure it was dead. I remember I was thinking, very far away, <i>this is good, I'm glad, I'm sure I'm glad.</i></p>

<p>But Schmendrick was screaming at the king, <q>Two hearts! <i>Two hearts!</i></q> until his voice split with it, and Molly was on me, trying to drag me away from the griffin, and <i>I</i> was hanging onto Malka&#8212;she'd gotten so <i>heavy&#8212;</i> and I don't know what else was happening right then, because all I was seeing and thinking about was Malka. And all I was feeling was her heart not beating under mine.</p>

<p>She guarded my cradle when I was born. I cut my teeth on her poor ears, and she never made one sound. My mother says so.</p>

<p>King Lir wasn't seeing or hearing any of us. There was nothing in the world for him but the griffin, which was flopping and struggling lopsidedly in the middle of the clearing. I couldn't help feeling sorry for it, even then, even after it had killed Malka and my friends, and all the sheep and goats too, and I don't know how many else. And King Lir must have felt the same way, because he got down from his black mare and went straight up to the griffin, and he spoke to it, lowering his sword until the tip was on the ground. He said, <q>You were a noble and terrible adversary&#8212;surely the last such I will ever confront. We have accomplished what we were born to do, the two of us. I thank you for your death.</q></p>

<p>And on that last word, the griffin had him.</p>

<p>It was the eagle, lunging up at him, dragging the lion half along, the way I'd been dragging Malka's dead weight. King Lir stepped back, swinging the sword fast enough to take off the griffin's head, but it was faster than he was. That dreadful beak caught him at the waist, shearing through his armor the way an axe would smash through piecrust, and he doubled over without a sound that I heard, looking like wetwash on the line. There was blood, and worse, and I couldn't have said if he was dead or alive. I thought the griffin was going to bite him in two.</p>

<p>I shook loose from Molly. She was calling to Schmendrick to <i>do</i> something, but of course he couldn't, and she knew it, because he'd promised King Lir that he wouldn't interfere by magic, whatever happened. But I wasn't a magician, and I hadn't promised anything to anybody. I told Malka I'd be right back.</p>

<p>The griffin didn't see me coming. It was bending its head down over King Lir, hiding him with its wings. The lion part trailing along so limply in the dust made it more fearful to see, though I can't say why, and it was making a sort of cooing, purring sound all the time. I had a big rock in my left hand, and a dead branch in my right, and I was bawling something, but I don't remember what. You can scare wolves away from the flock sometimes if you run at them like that, determined.</p>

<p>I can throw things hard with either hand&#8212;Wilfrid found <i>that</i> out when I was still small&#8212;and the griffin looked up fast when the rock hit it on the side of its neck. It didn't like that, but it was too busy with King Lir to bother with me. I didn't think for a minute that my branch was going to be any use on even a half-dead griffin, but I threw it as far as I could, so that the griffin would look away for a moment, and as soon as it did I made a little run and a big sprawling dive for the hilt of the king's sword, which was sticking out under him where he'd fallen. I knew I could lift it because of having buckled it on him when we set out together.</p>

<p>But I couldn't get it free. He was too heavy, like Malka. But I wouldn't give up or let go. I kept pulling and pulling on that sword, and I didn't feel Molly pulling at <i>me</i> again, and I didn't notice the griffin starting to scrabble toward me over King Lir's body. I did hear Schmendrick, sounding a long way off, and I thought he was singing one of the nonsense songs he'd made up for me, only why would he be doing something like that just now? Then I did finally look up, to push my sweaty hair off my face, just before the griffin grabbed me up in one of its claws, yanking me away from Molly to throw me down on top of King Lir. His armor was so cold against my cheek, it was as though the armor had died with him.</p>

<p>The griffin looked into my eyes. That was the worst of all, worse than the pain where the claw had me, worse than not seeing my parents and stupid Wilfrid anymore, worse than knowing that I hadn't been able to save either the king or Malka. Griffins can't talk (dragons do, but only to heroes, King Lir told me), but those golden eyes were saying into my eyes, <q>Yes, I will die soon, but you are all dead now, all of you, and I will pick your bones before the ravens have mine. And your folk will remember what I was, and what I did to them, when there is no one left in your vile, pitiful anthill who remembers your name. So I have won.</q> And I knew it was true.</p>

<p>Then there wasn't anything but that beak and that burning gullet opening over me.</p>

<p>Then there was.</p>

<p>I thought it was a cloud. I was so dazed and terrified that I really thought it was a white cloud, only traveling so low and so fast that it smashed the griffin off King Lir and away from me, and sent me tumbling into Molly's arms at the same time. She held me tightly, practically smothering me, and it wasn't until I wriggled my head free that I saw what had come to us. I can see it still, in my mind. I see it right now.</p>

<p>They don't look <i>anything</i> like horses. I don't know where people got that notion. Four legs and a tail, yes, but the hooves are split, like a deer's hooves, or a goat's, and the head is smaller and more&#8212;<i>pointy</i>&#8212;than a horse's head. And the whole body is different from a horse, it's like saying a snowflake looks like a cow. The horn looks too long and heavy for the body, you can't imagine how a neck that delicate can hold up a horn that size. But it can.</p>

<p>Schmendrick was on his knees, with his eyes closed and his lips moving, as though he was still singing. Molly kept whispering, <q>Amalthea &hellip; Amalthea&hellip;</q> not to me, not to anybody. The unicorn was facing the griffin across the king's body. Its front feet were skittering and dancing a little, but its back legs were setting themselves to charge, the way rams do. Only rams put their heads down, while the unicorn held its head high, so that the horn caught the sunlight and glowed like a seashell. It gave a cry that made me want to dive back into Molly's skirt and cover my ears, it was so raw and so &hellip; <i>hurt.</i> Then its head did go down.</p>

<p>Dying or not, the griffin put up a furious fight. It came hopping to meet the unicorn, but then it was out of the way at the last minute, with its bloody beak snapping at the unicorn's legs as it flashed by. But each time that happened, the unicorn would turn instantly, much quicker than a horse could have turned, and come charging back before the griffin could get itself braced again. It wasn't a bit fair, but I didn't feel sorry for the griffin anymore.</p>

<p>The last time, the unicorn slashed sideways with its horn, using it like a club, and knocked the griffin clean off its feet. But it was up before the unicorn could turn, and it actually leaped into the air, dead lion half and all, just high enough to come down on the unicorn's back, raking with its eagle claws and trying to bite through the unicorn's neck, the way it did with King Lir. I screamed then, I couldn't help it, but the unicorn reared up until I thought it was going to go over backwards, and it flung the griffin to the ground, whirled and drove its horn straight through the iron feathers to the eagle heart. It trampled the body for a good while after, but it didn't need to.</p>

<p>Schmendrick and Molly ran to King Lir. They didn't look at the griffin, or even pay very much attention to the unicorn. I wanted to go to Malka, but I followed them to where he lay. I'd seen what the griffin had done to him, closer than they had, and I didn't see how he could still be alive. But he was, just barely. He opened his eyes when we kneeled beside him, and he smiled so sweetly at us all, and he said, <q>Lisene? Lisene, I should have a bath, shouldn't I?</q></p>

<p>I didn't cry. Molly didn't cry. Schmendrick did. He said, <q>No, Majesty. No, you do not need bathing, truly.</q></p>

<p>King Lir looked puzzled. <q>But I smell bad, Lisene. I think I must have wet myself.</q> He reached for my hand and held it so hard. <q>Little one,</q> he said. <q>Little one, I know you. Do not be ashamed of me because I am old.</q></p>

<p>I squeezed his hand back, as hard as I could. <q>Hello, Your Majesty,</q> I said. <q>Hello.</q> I didn't know what else to say.</p>

<p>Then his face was suddenly young and happy and wonderful, and he was gazing far past me, reaching toward something with his eyes. I felt a breath on my shoulder, and I turned my head and saw the unicorn. It was bleeding from a lot of deep scratches and bites, especially around its neck, but all you could see in its dark eyes was King Lir. I moved aside so it could get to him, but when I turned back, the king was gone. I'm nine, almost ten. I know when people are gone.</p>

<p>The unicorn stood over King Lir's body for a long time. I went off after a while to sit beside Malka, and Molly came and sat with me. But Schmendrick stayed kneeling by King Lir, and he was talking to the unicorn. I couldn't hear what he was saying, but I could tell from his face that he was asking for something, a favor. My mother says she can always tell before I open my mouth. The unicorn wasn't answering, of course&#8212;they can't talk either, I'm almost sure&#8212;but Schmendrick kept at it until the unicorn turned its head and looked at him. Then he stopped, and he stood up and walked away by himself. The unicorn stayed where she was.</p>

<p>Molly was saying how brave Malka had been, and telling me that she'd never known another dog who attacked a griffin. She asked if Malka had ever had pups, and I said, yes, but none of them was Malka. It was very strange. She was trying hard to make me feel better, and I was trying to comfort her because she couldn't. But all the while I felt so cold, almost as far away from everything as Malka had gone. I closed her eyes, the way you do with people, and I sat there and I stroked her side, over and over.</p>

<p>I didn't notice the unicorn. Molly must have, but she didn't say anything. I went on petting Malka, and I didn't look up until the horn came slanting over my shoulder. Close to, you could see blood drying in the shining spirals, but I wasn't afraid. I wasn't anything. Then the horn touched Malka, very lightly, right where I was stroking her, and Malka opened her eyes.</p>

<p>It took her a while to understand that she was alive. It took me longer. She ran her tongue out first, panting and panting, looking so <i>thirsty.</i> We could hear a stream trickling somewhere close, and Molly went and found it, and brought water back in her cupped hands. Malka lapped it all up, and then she tried to stand and fell down, like a puppy. But she kept trying, and at last she was properly on her feet, and she tried to lick my face, but she missed it the first few times. I only started crying when she finally managed it.</p>

<p>When she saw the unicorn, she did a funny thing. She stared at it for a moment, and then she bowed or curtseyed, in a dog way, stretching out her front legs and putting her head down on the ground between them. The unicorn nosed at her, very gently, so as not to knock her over again. It looked at me for the first time &hellip; or maybe I really looked at <i>it</i> for the first time, past the horn and the hooves and the magical whiteness, all the way into those endless eyes. And what they did, somehow, the unicorn's eyes, was to free me from the griffin's eyes. Because the awfulness of what I'd seen there didn't go away when the griffin died, not even when Malka came alive again. But the unicorn had all the world in her eyes, all the world I'm never going to see, but it doesn't matter, because now I <i>have</i> seen it, and it's beautiful, and I was in there too. And when I think of Jehane, and Louli, and my Felicitas who could only talk with her eyes, just like the unicorn, I'll think of them, and not the griffin. That's how it was when the unicorn and I looked at each other.</p>

<p>I didn't see if the unicorn said goodbye to Molly and Schmendrick, and I didn't see when it went away. I didn't want to. I did hear Schmendrick saying, <q>A dog. I nearly kill myself singing her to Lir, calling her as no other has <i>ever</i> called a unicorn&#8212;and she brings back, not him, but the dog. And here I'd always thought she had no sense of humor.</q></p>

<p>But Molly said, <q>She loved him too. That's why she let him go. Keep your voice down.</q> I was going to tell her it didn't matter, that I knew Schmendrick was saying that because he was so sad, but she came over and petted Malka with me, and I didn't have to. She said, <q>We will escort you and Malka home now, as befits two great ladies. Then we will take the king home too.</q></p>

<p><q>And I'll never see you again,</q> I said. <q>No more than I'll see him.</q></p>

<p>Molly asked me, <q>How old are you, Sooz?</q></p>

<p><q>Nine,</q> I said. <q>Almost ten. You know that.</q></p>

<p><q>You can whistle?</q> I nodded. Molly looked around quickly, as though she were going to steal something. She bent close to me, and she whispered, <q>I will give you a present, Sooz, but you are not to open it until the day when you turn seventeen. On that day you must walk out away from your village, walk out all alone into some quiet place that is special to you, and you must whistle like this.</q> And she whistled a little ripple of music for me to whistle back to her, repeating and repeating it until she was satisfied that I had it exactly. <q>Don't whistle it anymore,</q> she told me. <q>Don't whistle it aloud again, not once, until your seventeenth birthday, but keep whistling it inside you. Do you understand the difference, Sooz?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not a baby,</q> I said. <q>I understand. What will happen when I do whistle it?</q></p>

<p>Molly smiled at me. She said, <q>Someone will come to you. Maybe the greatest magician in the world, maybe only an old lady with a soft spot for valiant, impudent children.</q> She cupped my cheek in her hand. <q>And just maybe even a unicorn. Because beautiful things will always want to see you again, Sooz, and be listening for you. Take an old lady's word for it. Someone will come.</q></p>

<p>They put King Lir on his own horse, and I rode with Schmendrick, and they came all the way home with me, right to the door, to tell my mother and father that the griffin was dead, and that I had helped, and you should have seen Wilfrid's face when they said <i>that!</i> Then they both hugged me, and Molly said in my ear, <q>Remember&#8212;not till you're seventeen!</q> and they rode away, taking the king back to his castle to be buried among his own folk. And I had a cup of cold milk and went out with Malka and my father to pen the flock for the night.</p>

<p>So that's what happened to me. I practice the music Molly taught me in my head, all the time, I even dream it some nights, but I don't ever whistle it aloud. I talk to Malka about our adventure, because I have to talk to <i>someone</i>. And I promise her that when the time comes she'll be there with me, in the special place I've already picked out. She'll be an old dog lady then, of course, but it doesn't matter. Someone will come to us both.</p>

<p>I hope it's them, those two. A unicorn is very nice, but they're my friends. I want to feel Molly holding me again, and hear the stories she didn't have time to tell me, and I want to hear Schmendrick singing that silly song:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Soozli, Soozli,<br />
speaking loozli,<br />
you disturb my oozli-goozli.<br />
Soozli, Soozli<br />
would you choozli<br />
to become my squoozli-squoozli&hellip;?</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can wait.</p>
