        <p>Vamps. There are people who can Â¿pull youth? from other people if they are in particular states of mind. One of the situations that encourages this state is engagement in a concert. For this reason many of them work as support musicians and roadies.</p>
        <p>The term <q>to vamp</q> refers to a period when the audience's energy is directed toward (and more accessible to) the secondary performers.</p>
        <p>Vamps can <q>push</q> normals. Backstory lines trail a conflict between two+ covens of roadies travelling with tours.</p>
