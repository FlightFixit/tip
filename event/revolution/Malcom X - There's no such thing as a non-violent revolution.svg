I would like to make a few comments concerning the difference between the black
revolution and the Negro revolution. There's a difference. When you study the historic nature of revolutions, the motive of a revolution, the objective of a revolution, the result of a
revolution, and the methods used in a revolution, you may change words. You may devise
another program, you may change your goal and you may change your mind.


Look at the American Revolution in 1776. That revolution was for what? For land. Why
did they want land? Independence. How was it carried out? Bloodshed.

Number one, it was
based on land, the basis of independence. And the only way they could get it was
bloodshed.

The French Revolution, what was it based on? The landless against the landlord.
What was it for? Land. How did they get it? Bloodshed. Was no love lost, was no compromise, was no negotiation. I'm telling you, you
don't know what a revolution is. Because when you find out what it is, you'll get back in the
alley, you'll get out of the way.

The Russian Revolution, what was it based on? Land; the landless against the landlord.
How did they bring it about? Bloodshed. You haven't got a revolution that doesn't involve
bloodshed. And you're afraid to bleed. I said, you're afraid to bleed.

Long as the white man sent you to Korea, you bled. He sent you to Germany, you bled.
He sent you to the South Pacific to fight the Japanese, you bled. You bleed for white
people, but when it comes to seeing your own churches being bombed and little black girls
murdered, you haven't got any blood.

So I cite these various revolutions, brothers and sisters, to show you: you don't have a peaceful revolution. You don't have a turn-the-other-cheek revolution. There's no such thing as a non-violent revolution. Only kind of revolution that's non-violent is the Negro revolution.

The only revolution based on loving your enemy is the Negro revolution. The only revolution in which the goal is a dessegregated lunch counter, a dessegregated theatre, a dessgeeregared park and a deseggregated public toilet (so you can sit down next to white folks on the toilet). That's no revolution.

Revolution is based on land. Land is the basis of all independence. Land is the basis of freedom, justice and equality. The white man knows what a revolution is. How do you think he'll react to you when you learn what a real revolution is?

You don't know what a revolution is. If you did, you wouldn't use that word. A revolution is bloody. Revolution is hostile. Revolution knows no compromise. Revolution overturns and destroys everything that gets in its way.
