<title>The Strange Redemption of Sister Mary Ann</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>The Strange Redemption of Sister Mary Ann</h1>
<h2>by Mike Moscoe</h2>

<p>Human understanding relies on models, and it&rsquo;s not always clear which one is closest to truth.</p>

<p>She lay in Bill&rsquo;s arms, his soft snoring merging with the chirping of crickets and croaking of frogs. They&rsquo;d slipped out of the cabin to make love under the full moon. Now he was asleep and she was warm. Even after twenty years, she floated on the love she&rsquo;d felt for him the first moment she saw him.</p>

<p>As she cuddled closer to his chest, the arm he&rsquo;d thrown over her brushed a breast and her nipple grew hard again. She felt a sneaky smile growing, along with a lot of other things, and considered how she might wake him up. Up was such a nice word when the kids were asleep.</p>

<p><q>Mommy, play with me now,</q> came with that blend of plea and demand babies got so good at. But the kids were almost seven and she was more often Mom than Mommy.</p>

<p>And the voices were all wrong.</p>

<p>She glanced around the moonlit yard. Below her a frog plopped into the lake. Around her the first of summer&rsquo;s fireflies flit. No. Those weren&rsquo;t bugs.</p>

<p>At the heart of each little light, a tiny baby wiggled. <q>Come on, Mommy. Play with us a while. Please,</q> a shrill voice demanded.</p>

<p><q>Mommy can&rsquo;t play with you,</q> Mary Ann said, the warmth of Bill&rsquo;s lovemaking lost to a chill. <q>You were never born, little ones.</q></p>

<br/>

<p>Sister Mary Ann came awake with a start as the cancer eating her gut shot a pain through her that almost knocked her off the kneeler. The other nuns were so solicitous of her, come late to the convent after a full life in the world and now so sick. They insisted she use the <i>prie dieu</i> to save her knees.</p>

<p>With a shrug, Mary Ann, slipped off the kneeler and onto the cool tiles. That should keep her awake, keep the dreams at bay. Mary Ann had volunteered for the two a.m. shift of this forty-hour devotion as her penance, though she hardly counted staying awake any sacrifice. She slept little these days.</p>

<p>And here, in the early morning, the crickets humming in the dark outside the thick adobe chapel walls reminding her of other times. The scent of the unworked wood that made up the ancient-style roof above her head brought back memories.</p>

<p>These were the smells of the house by the lake that she and Bill took the kids to for a week each summer. And late at night, when the exhausted children were abed at last, she and Bill would make love on the couch, the windows open to the chirp of crickets, the aroma of pine cones and evergreens mixing well with the scent of their lovemaking.</p>

<p>Sister Mary Ann recaptured her wandering thoughts and herded them back to familiar prayer, asking a loving God to look after the four children she had given life to, loved and cared for and who now lived busy lives of their own with wives and husbands, children and maybe even a grandchild. Those were easy.</p>

<p>It was more difficult to ask that same loving God to forgive her the sins she had let science commit on her body. Here, her scientific training still battled with her faith. This close to death she tried to simply submit to Holy Mother Church&rsquo;s decree. Still her mind questioned. With a sigh she once again forced down her doubts and said her penitent&rsquo;s prayers.</p>

<p>The last prayer was the most difficult of all. How did she pray for children she&rsquo;d never known, the ones that had vanished so quickly across death&rsquo;s door, if indeed they had ever lived? <i>Oops, don&rsquo;t argue. Submit. That cancer won&rsquo;t wait forever.</i> She had no names for those little ones. She didn&rsquo;t even know how many they were, a hand full, dozens? She had never bandaged a knee for them, shouted at their ball games, cried at their weddings. They were the hard ones to pray for, so she tried to pray for them the most.</p>

<p>Sister Mary Ann did not bother praying for herself. The cancer held her tight in its embrace &hellip; it would not let her go. The cancer&rsquo;s pain didn&rsquo;t bother Mary Ann all that much. She had lived long enough; she&rsquo;d sinned as much as seemed convenient. Now her body offered her a painful penance. Penance and sacrifice had never been a part of her life, not around Bill and the kids. Now it demanded center place and she approached it more from curiosity than anything else. Life had taught her many lessons; what was she to learn from this?</p>

<p>Most lessons she learned the hard way. Like putting off and putting off. Finally happy with life and career and ready to find a place in her full schedule for children, she found that she was barren.</p>

<p>In an earlier time, that would have been that, but science offered her options. The Church had definite opinions on such matters, but when the men and women in their immaculate white coats offered her choices, she and Bill took them without a moment&rsquo;s reflection. She was surprised how much pain there was as the docs went about harvesting her own eggs. She watched with Bill from behind thick glass as the specialists dripped his sperm into the dish with her eggs. It felt strange more than anything else when they returned the fertilized eggs to her motherly protection. Of the eight eggs inserted in her uterus, four took hold and grew.</p>

<p>Allen, Becky, Charles and Diana came into her life, squealing, squalling, growing, learning &hellip; needing more than their fair share of her life. E, F, G and H had not made it. Failed to implant, failed to thrive. At thirty-eight, Mary Ann had shrugged off the doctors&rsquo; bland words, joyful at the four she birthed. Glad not to have to go through all that again, she hadn&rsquo;t thought a moment before signing away to research programs the other eggs they&rsquo;d taken from her.</p>

<p>Busy with her new world, she&rsquo;d felt just as permanent, just as immortal as any of the other mothers working, homemaking, driving kids here and there, and being driven up every available wall by them as well.</p>

<p>It was years later before she began to wonder at what she had done. Only when Bill was in the final stages of his illness, pain-wracked and needing her. She spent every waking moment with him, staggering home only to fall in bed for a few scanty hours before returning to the hospital.</p>

<p>That was when the lost children came back.</p>

<p>They came back to fill her dreams with their presence, to fill her muzzy head with waking questions, creeping doubts. Watching the flesh of the man who had held her for forty years wither, the sparkle in the eyes that had lit her days and nights dim, she could not close her eyes without wondering if maybe she had done something wrong to deserve this.</p>

<p>For six months after Bill passed on, the tiny children would not leave her nights. Mary sought solace in work, in friends, in family. A older friend suggested a quiet place, far back in the wilderness of New Mexico. There, on retreat at the Convent of Our Sorrowful Mother, Mary Ann found repose.</p>

<p>In a rushed month, she did it. She called the children together, told them of her decision, listened to them as they laid out all the reasons not to do this mad thing. Then she laid out her reasons for taking the habit so late in life. She never mentioned the tiny children.</p>

<p><q>Mom, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever do it, but I can&rsquo;t say it isn&rsquo;t the best thing for you,</q> Diane had said, speaking for her children, her born offspring.</p>

<p>Mary Ann took less than a month to finish matters. Had she thought long, maybe she would have thought herself out of it. <i>So don&rsquo;t think</i>. She sold all she owned, split it among her children and the convent, and signed herself into the cloister and its ancient rule, though not the ancient names &hellip; times had changed and Mary Ann became simply Sister Mary Ann.
</p>

<p>If names were not different here, life certainly was. She spent her days with women who thought a power lunch was Sister Rose reading from the Rule of Saint Benedict. Poor Rose was hard of hearing and shouted the rule at the top of her lungs. A killing in the market for Sister Carmella was a hundred pounds of wheat bought at market-value and milled for free. Mary Ann thanked God for her sense of humor. It was often all that saved her as her old life juxtaposed itself on her new one.
</p>

<p>The sound of her own soft chuckle reminded Mary Ann that her prayers had given way to distraction &hellip; again. She focused her thoughts on the statue of Mary before her; it was special for her. No fancy dress for this Madonna, she wore an apron. The sleeves of her smock were rolled up to her elbows. This woman was a seriously working mom. Still, one hand rested on the head of her eight-year-old son who held a hammer and saw. She smiled down like any mom sending her kid off to work with dad.</p>

<p>That first morning on retreat, the busy mother, smiling after her Son had filled Mary Ann&rsquo;s waking dream. Truth be told, that reflection of mother and child had a lot to do with her being here, accepting her vow of permanence, no more to wander the earth but stay here all the days of her life.</p>

<p>And God in His or Her divine humor had seen to it that her days here would be short.</p>

<p><i>Lord, but the human mind can wander</i>. Sister Mary Ann concentrated her thoughts on the mother before her. <i>Please Mother Mary, take care of my children. Bless Allen and Becky and Charles and Diana. Bless their wives and husbands and kids. And Mary, hold close the littlest ones that I never could. Give them the hugs and kisses I couldn&rsquo;t give. And tell them their mother really did love them.</i></p>

<p>Finally, a prayer.</p>

<p>Then the pain hit, and the darkness took her as she slumped to the red tiles of the chapel&rsquo;s floor.</p>

<br/>

<div class="italic">
<p>She stood on a cliff. The gale winds billowed her habit out behind her, black against inkjet night and sky. Cloth tight against her breasts and belly, her flesh tingled as if Bill were running his fingers up and down her, slowly, gently readying her for him. There were stars before her.</p>

<p>No. Not stars. Lights! Tiny lights that danced on the wind. <q>Mother, come,</q> they called to her in tinkling voices. She took a step forward; her sandaled feet found only air. Without a thought, she took two steps back from the edge.</p>

<p><q>Oh, mom! You promised you would play with us.</q> The voice was Allan&rsquo;s, almost. His and not his. She studied the lights. One held in place, tiny arms folded over a chubby chest. Again, not quite like Allen.</p>

<p><q>I can&rsquo;t come, children. Mom&rsquo;s too big,</q> Mary Ann said.</p>
</div>

<br/>

<p>Sister Mary Ann awoke to the antiseptic smells of the small infirmary. Mother Superior sat in the chair next to her bed. Sister Veronica&rsquo;s tall, thin frame hovered behind her.</p>

<p><q>Are you all right?</q> Mother Superior made the question more an order. She put the same definite tone in every word she spoke. Rome saw no need for nuns wasting their time in contemplation, kneeling in chapels. The laity were in the world, curia bureaucrats pointed out, and that was where the church and its servants belonged.</p>

<p>But this diocese had a young bishop, who maybe paid a tad more attention to his flock than distant bureaucrats did. He and Sister Superior met only once to discuss the Will of God for a certain small group of women and the good bishop had gone away to tie up Roman powers-that-were into legalistic debates that ought to outlive them all, if not God Himself.</p>

<p><q>No worse than usual,</q> Sister Mary Ann assured her last superior on earth.</p>

<p><q>Do you need to return to the hospital?</q> That truly was a question. A rarity from Mother Superior.</p>

<p><q>No.</q> The word was simple, short, but so laden. Diagnosed with cancer, Mary Ann had dutifully suffered all that modern medical science required of its victims. Having once become a mother, she thought there were few new outrages the white-smocked medics could commit against her. She had been wrong but she endured it all for the required length of time.</p>

<p>She felt neither surprise nor regret when the doctors gathered to admit they could not count her among the lucky ones. Mary Ann had enjoyed so much good luck in her life; she felt no right to bemoan some bad. Of course, the doctors were not willing to admit defeat &hellip; they had option after option to extend her life a week, a day, a minute longer.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;d posed her question to the hospital chaplain, who brought in the dioecian moral theologian. Under official church teaching further measures could be deemed <q>heroic</q> and not required of her. She&rsquo;d signed herself out of the hospital, mentally shaking its sterilized dust from her sandals.</p>

<p>Her four children had not been so easy to leave. They&rsquo;d shown up with family in tow. The goodbyes had gone long. Tears there were, and laughs too. Goddamn it &hellip; <i>oops, sorry, Lord</i> &hellip; Mary Ann had insisted there be laughter. They all knew when they left her she would not cross the cloister wall again before the funeral mass. No, it was Mass of Resurrection, now. So many changes when you lived a long life.</p>

<p><q>You are tired. Rest,</q> Sister Superior ordered.</p>

<p>Sister Mary Ann nodded agreement and was left to Sister Veronica&rsquo;s gentle ministrations.</p>

<p><q>The kids come again?</q> Rana asked when they were alone.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> Mary Ann said. <q>Shining like little stars. So many of them.</q></p>

<p><q>M.A., give them to God.</q> Like Mary Ann, Veronica had come late to the cloister door. Rana had been just about every kind of nurse a hospital needed, from the ER to Psych ward. She&rsquo;d seen it all. Done quite a bit of it, too. Rana and M.A. often shared smiles at what went over the innocent heads of the others.</p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;ve given them to God. I gave them to Jesus. I&rsquo;ve asked Mary to give them a hug.</q> Mary Ann shook her head ruefully. <q>Why won&rsquo;t they leave me alone? Why do they keep coming back to haunt me!</q></p>

<p><q>M.A.,</q> Rana said softly, <q>I had three miscarriages while I was having my three girls. A friend of mine lost six getting her lone child. Every woman born has lost kids if she spent any time intimate with those goons we love for God only knows why. Maybe as many as half of our pregnancies end that way. And now the researchers are telling us that every time one of our eggs meet up with their wiggly things, as many as half never manage to hook up to our uterus and even start a pregnancy. Face it, M. A., those of us that get born are a minority.</q></p>

<p>Mary Ann found herself laughing. <q>So how come the poor high school girl catches in the backseat her first time at the drive-in? Why would God make her have to tell her boyfriend, their parents, that she&rsquo;s in the lucky quarter while I spent years telling my husban <q>not this month?</q></q></p>

<p>Rana snorted. Mary Ann could almost hear her friend say <q>just the luck of the draw.</q> As twenty-first-century women, they lived in a world where science hunted for the truth by repeatable evidence. But now they wore the habit in holy cloister. They were sworn to believe God had a loving plan for each and every child of His even if, as women in the world, they might rarely have caught a glimpse of it.</p>

<p>So why had Mary Ann decided to end her life here among women of faith? Herself a woman of faith believing without evidence &hellip; even against the evidence.</p>

<p>From the look in Rana&rsquo;s eyes, she could hear every word M. A. was thinking. She rested a hand on Mary Ann&rsquo;s arm. <q>You want a pain pill?</q></p>

<p><q>No. It&rsquo;s not that bad,</q> Mary Ann lied.</p>

<p>Rana shook her head, not taken in, but accepted Mary Ann&rsquo;s need for relief beyond what pills offered. Sister Veronica tucked the blankets around her friend as she might a loved child. <q>I&rsquo;ll bunk down in the hall. If you need me, holler.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank you,</q> Sister Mary Ann said as she composed herself for sleep. The pain was there, always reminding her of the cancer devouring her life, cutting short her time for questioning.
</p>

<p>For Mary Ann, there was something very wrong about her body turning on her like this. She remembered how Bill had made her body sing with passion. He played her more expertly than any man had ever played an instrument carved of wood. And she&rsquo;d gone through her day, still vibrating with his love, sharing her joy with family, friends, the world.</p>

<p>That was the way it should be.</p>

<p>So why was she wracked with cancer? What was God trying to tell her? Did God even notice?</p>

<p>Because this certainly was not the way she wanted to be, cancer poisoning her body, letting the sharp pain in her gut slip into her words, reducing her to the one cared for when all she wanted to do was care for others.</p>

<p>As a woman of faith, she&rsquo;d been taught that God revealed himself through his world. <i>Even our bodies proclaim His love</i>, had brought a blush to the young nun reading the passage at lunch. Mary Ann did not blush, she&rsquo;d married a good husband and come by her memories with lusty honesty. No, it was the here and now that puzzled her. Was this pain, devouring her flesh, making her struggle to keep a smile on her face, something she was supposed to offer up for all the pleasure she had taken? Mary Ann shook her head, that theology rang hollow in her ears no matter how many times the visiting priest on Sunday rambled back to it in his homilies.</p>

<p>Mary Ann returned to the one thing she knew was true. She was dying. Soon the world would go on without her. Neither she nor Rana expected some kind of quiz would come next to determine heaven or hell for them. Still, Mary Ann was disgusted with herself. Here she was living under Death&rsquo;s coattails and she still had no idea about something so basic as why she was hurting. Biology told her how she hurt. But after all her years she still had so little wisdom about why.</p>

<p>She risked the pain to roll over on her side and arranged pillows to let her rest a bit more comfortably. Surely, God would not hold that against her.</p>

<p>She slept, and the children came.</p>

<br/>

<p><i>She sat on a log beside the lake. She could hear Allen and Becky arguing over who got the back of the canoe; who got to steer them out on the lake. They&rsquo;d still be arguing at Christmas whether the east or the west end of the lake was the most fascinating.</i></p>

<p><i><q>Mommy, can we swim?</q> was so plaintive. She looked around. Nothing. Then she looked down. Around her on the grass were dozens of tiny, naked children.</i></p>

<p><i><q>Do you know how?</q></i></p>

<p><i><q>Of course we do, mom. We&rsquo;re not babies,</q> one shouted as she slipped off a toadstool and raced for the water&rsquo;s edge. For legs so tiny, it should have taken them hours to reach the lake. They were splashing and laughing in only a second.</i></p>

<p><i><q>Come on in, mom, its wonderful.</q></i></p>

<p><i>Mary Ann tossed off her heavy winter coat and started untying her boots. By the time she had both boots off, the coat was back on. She repeated the process four or five times before she stopped, puzzled.</i></p>

<p><i><q>Come on in, mom.</q></i></p>

<p><i><q>I can&rsquo;t. With my boots on, my coat, I&rsquo;ll drown.</q></i></p>

<p><i><q>Take &rsquo;em off, mom.</q></i></p>

<p><i><q>I can&rsquo;t. They won&rsquo;t come off.</q></i></p>

<p><i>A small naked figure walked from the water. She folded her arms across her chest and tossed her head to the right just like Diana. <q>If you won&rsquo;t get rid of all that stuff, how can we have fun?</q></i></p>

<p>Mary Ann awoke in the night. The sharp pain from rolling onto her back had ended that dream. Dream?</p>

<p>She remembered the first time Rana tried to console her, describing when the pregnancy test first turned blue for her, only to be cramped over and gushing a week before she could get in to see a doctor about her pregnancy.</p>

<p><q>Your mom, my mom, Mary Ann, would just have called it a late, hard period and forget the whole thing. We took the pregnancy test when we were four or five days late. It tells us we&rsquo;re caught and we get excited. Then comes the blood and we aren&rsquo;t.</q> The nurse had raised her hands, palms up. Then flipped them palm down.</p>

<p>Mary Ann had shaken her head, repeating what she&rsquo;d heard over and over again in sermons or screamed by the Right-to-Lifers. <q>But every conception creates an immortal soul.</q> Mary Ann had heard it so often; did she believe it? Did her dreams tell her to believe it? Or were they just the crazy final imaginings of a brain facing the unknown and trying to make up an answer?</p>

<p>Back then, Rana snorted. <q>Yeah, every conception is an immortal soul if you&rsquo;re a celibate man sniffing around for a nice, clear break point to hang an argument on. Just once, I&rsquo;d like to see one of those celibates tell that to a wife who&rsquo;s reduced to tears. A wife who really knows what <q>Rachel, weeping for her children,</q> is all about. There she is, a woman reeling with hormones from hell, grieving for all the nights she won&rsquo;t rock that babe to sleep, the butterflies they won&rsquo;t bring her. And here&rsquo;s a guy spewing all that theological crap he hasn&rsquo;t thought through. Bull.</q></p>

<p>Harsh words for a nun, but Rana had been a nurse first.</p>

<p>Rana the nurse was suddenly at Mary Ann&rsquo;s bedside. <q>You okay, M.A.?</q></p>

<p><q>Did I make that much noise?</q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m a light sleeper.</q></p>

<p><q>Are you keeping the death watch on me?</q></p>

<p><q>How cold are your toes?</q></p>

<p><q>Icy.</q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;ll get another blanket. Should I call for a priest?</q></p>

<p>Mary Ann checked her conscience, like she had her gas gauge when she was running kids to music, gymnastics, soccer, et al. There were no new sins. The old ones were enough, thank you. <q>Can you stay with me?</q></p>

<p><q>Do I look like I have any place better to go, girl?</q></p>

<p>Rana returned with two blankets, spread one over Mary Ann, then left the other doubled over her feet.</p>

<p>Mary Ann didn&rsquo;t feel any warmer. <q>Rana, do you believe every time an egg and sperm meet God creates a new soul?</q></p>

<p><q>I honestly don&rsquo;t know,</q> the nurse and nun answered with her usual bluntness. Then she frowned in thought. When she began to speak, the words came slowly.</p>

<p><q>I met a very fine Presbyterian minister once.</q> Rana smiled at her description, or maybe at the memory. Mary Ann warmed to the girl-talk even as the rest of her grew colder. <q>Preacher man liked the way we Catholics baptized kids. <q>God acts, man reacts,</q> he said. <q>When we wait for grown people to make their own decision, it sounds like God is stuck reacting to us.</q> Kind of makes you think. He also thought the root of most of the big heresies was people thinking they&rsquo;d found the golden ring that let them haul God around by His nose.</q></p>

<p><q>So he&rsquo;d say that two kids fumbling in the back seat doesn&rsquo;t mean God has to&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>Or a lab technician fertilizing and freezing spares that will probably never be implanted in your womb. Do you really think that God would let them have control over Him?</q></p>

<p>Mary Ann breathed on that thought for several minutes. <q>Kind of funny. Half to three quarters of all starts never finishing.</q></p>

<p><q>And that&rsquo;s before you bring in human intervention and the <q class="single">A</q> word.</q></p>

<p><q>But what if the men are right and all those souls do get started?</q></p>

<p>Rana thought on that for a long moment, then grinned like an evil elf. <q>The preachers and priests make a big thing about Jesus coming to save sinners. They say we&rsquo;re blessed with the Word of God and the sacraments. Now wouldn&rsquo;t it be a laugh on them if the vast majority of souls slip right into God&rsquo;s arms without being touched by any of their holy stuff?</q></p>

<p>Mary Ann tried to laugh, but couldn&rsquo;t find the air for it. She settled for a wan smile. <q>You don&rsquo;t believe in Limbo.</q></p>

<p><q>No way, Saint Josi&eacute;. My God doesn&rsquo;t leave folks halfway to nowhere.</q></p>

<p><q>So my children &hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>Are waiting for you, M.A., praying a lot more for you than you are for them.</q></p>

<p><q>They want me to play with them.</q></p>

<p><q>Go play, dear friend. Go play with them.</q></p>

<p>Mary Ann&rsquo;s ears must be playing tricks on her. Rana wouldn&rsquo;t have choked on her words. Mary Ann closed her eyes. The pain was going dull. That felt better. She was tired. Maybe if she slept for a moment she could finish talking to her friend. There was something she wanted to say. Wouldn&rsquo;t do to let the old nurse have the last word.</p>

<br/>

<p>The children were splashing in the water, giggling. <q>Oh ma, you can come in. Please,</q> a tinkling voice wheedled.</p>

<p>Usually it was the kids wheedling to get into the water. Why would they want to get mom in? To splash me, of course, to get my hair soaked so it would be wild and stringy for Bill tonight when the exhausted kids were sound asleep and we had the living room to ourselves, to make love slowly with the door open mixing lake sounds and smells with our love making.</p>

<p><q>Mom, are you going to play with us or not?</q> a childish voice pouted.</p>

<p>Mary Ann tossed off the winter coat, attacked the sweater beneath. And the coat under it, and the next sweatshirt.</p>

<p><q>Mother, if you don&rsquo;t come in now, it&rsquo;ll be too late.</q> The young voice sounded like its heart might break.</p>

<p>Mary Ann walked into the water, booted feet keeping her ankles straight despite the large rocks rolling beneath her tread. Two tiny forms started back-stroking out into the lake. They grew with each stroke, baby fat giving way to rangy preadolescent bodies that with another stroke bobbed with the extra flesh and hair of maturity.</p>

<p><q>Mom, you have to come in now.</q> The mature woman&rsquo;s voice was low with urgency, intent eyes sparkled and dazzled.</p>

<p>Mary Ann walked. The boots and coats weighted her down. The water was up to her chest, her chin, her nose.</p>

<p><q>That&rsquo;s it, mom, keep coming. You can make it!</q></p>

<p>The words echoed a younger Mary Ann&rsquo;s own pleadings, urging a child to swim another stroke, pedal another yard.</p>

<p>The water rose over her head.</p>

<p>She couldn&rsquo;t breathe. She kept walking.</p>

<p><q>Come on, mom!</q> filled her ears.</p>

<p>She shed the coat, pulled the sodden sweater over her head. The buttons of her blouse fought her. She ripped the last one off. The boots each took a kick. The pants and panties went together. The bra snagged. Bill would have gotten it off in a snap. She felt herself sinking. She yanked the bra over her head, and kicked for the surface.</p>

<p><q>Mom! We knew you&rsquo;d make it!</q> greeted her.</p>

<p>She treaded water, looking around at dozens of familiar yet strange faces. <q>Where&rsquo;s Bill?</q> she asked urgently.</p>

<p>A face like Allen&rsquo;s, but not his, shook sadly. <q>It&rsquo;s so difficult for you born people to get free of what you can&rsquo;t have anymore. It&rsquo;s so hard for you to give it all up. But if you hold on to it like Dad, it drags you down and you lose all that is to come.</q></p>

<p>Mary Ann sank into the water, hardly stroking as her weight carried her down. The weight of Bill, of the children she&rsquo;d raised, of everything that she loved in the world, pulled her into the darkness.</p>

<p><q>Mom, please,</q> was a terrified scream.</p>

<p><q>Please, mother, please, for us. We&rsquo;ve waited for you. Don&rsquo;t you have any love for us at all?</q></p>

<p>The pressure of the water around Mary Ann grew great, driving the breath out of her. Her life full of memories fought with the children that were strangers to her. The two battled for her heart, her love, her <i>eternity.</i></p>

<br/>
