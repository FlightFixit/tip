    <p>The idea for this project is pretty straightforward: replace our existing economic and political systems with almost completely transparent computer mediated versions. This takes the form of an organization which records and publishes all of it's operations.</p>

    <p>The business model I am proposing is called an open market. Businesses codify their operations in an easily aggregatable store and everything, except what is necessary to protect consumer privacy, is published. Metasystems can then be created which coordinate the operation of independent actors in the marketplace.</p>

    <p>The combination I want to start with is a chain of <a href="https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/labor">restaurants</a>/<a href="https://github.com/dhappy/housing">hostels</a>. Workers sign up for <a href="https://github.com/dhappy/tour">working tours</a> and the system recommends the appropriate housing, shifts and rate of pay to make it work.</p>

    <p>The system relies heavily on the master/master replication capabilities of CouchDB. Each business has a pool of globally uniquely identified javascript objects. Those pools can be combined to create composite databases with references into the component parts.</p>

    <p>The first issue I'm addressing is the scheduling of shifts. I've taken a stab at this problem <a href="http://vols.herokuapp.com/shifts">previously in Rails</a>. I am looking to redo it in Ember and will trade bitcoin for commits.

    <h1><cite>2019</cite></h1>

    <p><cite>2019</cite> is a show set five years in the future. Everything that happens in our world happens there. There are three major systemic changes in progress:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Open Markets</strong>: A significant portion of businesses are making their operations public and the results being aggregated and analyzed is creating new efficiencies. Some plots of the show will follow a cadre of workers as they travel the globe.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquid Democracy</strong>: Users have digital identities verified by secret code sent to their registered voting address. They are able to specify delegates for votes or topical categories. The Technoanarchist candidate is running on a platform of converting the executive and legislative processes to completely transparent digital ones â€” to be the last President of the United States.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reformed Scientology</strong>: Actual scientists subvert and subsume the power structure of the Scientologist Church making it empirical, transparent, and donation-based. Much of the doctrine is replaced with Gaianism, which deifies life as Goddess. Part of the power structure of the Church is anonymous and conducted via pseudonyms. I've been imagining aspects of the induction process and theology:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Basic Amenities</strong>: Instead of providing guaranteed income, the goal is to make food and shelter available as pay-what-you-can. There are funding pools to make up what people can't pay. An applicant makes tithes to these via bitcoin and sends a signed claim to the Church.</li>
          <li><strong>Coordinated Networking</strong>: Algorithms organize meetings of people, experiences, and substances. They review each other and progress through some sort of power structure.</li>
          <li><strong>Automated Deprogramming</strong>: Eventually an applicant is invited to an extended event. I'm imagining a trip on a large boat.</li>
          <li><strong>Progressive Stabalization</strong>: Members of the church act as sensors and actuators for an AI tasked with reducing incidinces of unwanted violence. The system plans where to place infrastructure and populations to maximize stability.</li>
          <li><strong>A Day w/o Hunger</strong>: A <a href="http://hoenir.himinbi.org/2014/04/rationale-for-the-department-of-happiness/">personal description interface</a> is widdely available and the bulk of the food supply is interoperable. The stabalization AI is getting progressively closer to a day when there is no self-reported unwanted hunger.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
