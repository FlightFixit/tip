    <p>The idea for this project is pretty straightforward: replace our existing economic and political systems with almost completely transparent computer mediated versions. The process is theoretically simple: record and publish all the operations of an organization then use computers to come up with more efficient systems and obsolesce the current order.</p>

    <p>The business model I am proposing is called an open market. Software codifies business operations and everything except what is necessary to protect consumer privacy is published. Systems are then able to aggregate data across businesses and interact by recommending transactions.</p>

    <p>The combination I want to start with is a chain of <a href="https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/costs">restaurants</a>/<a href="https://github.com/dhappy/housing">hostels</a>. Workers sign up for <a href="https://github.com/dhappy/tour">working tours</a> and the system coordinates the appropriate housing, shifts and rate of pay to make it work.</p>

    <p>The system relies heavily on the master/master replication capabilities of CouchDB. Each business has a pool of globally uniquely identified javascript objects. Those pools can be combined to create composite databases with references into the component parts.</p>

    <p>I am in the design phase currently. I'm trying to figure out just what data needs to be stored. In terms of interfaces there are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Order Entry</strong>: Either the customer entering on their device or the server entering on a tablet.</li>
      <li><strong>Kitchen</strong>: Touch screen or tablet with receipt printer. Ticket goes out with the meal to identify the destination.</li>
      <li><strong>Cashier</strong>: Users can pay via a device, but there should also be the option of receiving a receipt and paying a cashier.</li>
      <li><strong>Costs</strong>: Inventory and overhead tracking.</li>
      <li><strong>Suppliers</strong>: Organizations providing ingredients.</li>
      <li><strong>Recipes</strong>: I want prices to be computed from costs. Also I want users to be able to import caloric information from their receipt.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I'm developing the application in Ember and will trade bitcoin for commits.

    <h1><cite>2019</cite></h1>

    <p><cite>2019</cite> is set five years in the future. Everything that happens in our world happens there. There are three major systemic changes in progress:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Open Markets</strong>: A significant portion of businesses are making their operations public and the results being aggregated and analyzed is creating new efficiencies. Some plots of the show will follow a cadre of workers as they travel the globe.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquid Democracy</strong>: Users have digital identities verified by secret code sent to their registered voting address. They are able to specify delegates for votes or topical categories. The Technoanarchist candidate is running on a platform of converting the executive and legislative processes to digital ones â€” to be the last President of the United States.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reformed Scientology</strong>: Actual scientists subvert and subsume the power structure of the Scientologist Church making it empirical, transparent, and donation-based. Much of the doctrine is replaced with Gaianism, which deifies life as Goddess. Part of the power structure of the Church is anonymous and conducted via pseudonyms. I've been imagining aspects of the induction process and theology:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Basic Amenities</strong>: Instead of providing guaranteed income, the goal is to make food and shelter available as pay-what-you-can. There are funding pools to make up what people can't pay. An applicant makes tithes to these via bitcoin and sends a signed claim to the Church.</li>
          <li><strong>Coordinated Networking</strong>: Algorithms organize meetings of people, experiences, and substances. They review each other and progress through some sort of power structure.</li>
          <li><strong>Automated Deprogramming</strong>: Eventually an applicant is invited to an extended event. I'm imagining a trip on a large boat.</li>
          <li><strong>Progressive Stabalization</strong>: Members of the church act as sensors and actuators for an AI tasked with reducing incidinces of unwanted violence. The system plans where to place infrastructure and populations to maximize stability.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
