    <h1>Tabulating</h1>
    <p>I'm working on some webapps where I've got several pages of information that a user will be flipping between. There are two factors I am trying to minimize: user wait and server load. Also because the application will be deployed in an environment with a variety of browsers and little user control over the system, the application needs to degrade gracefully.</p>
    <p>The basis for most of these comes from <a href="menutypes.html">pure CSS menus</a>.</p>
    <h2>Ideal Case: Full CSS and Full ECMAScript</h2>
    <p>Ideally, I will have a browser that fully supports both css and ecmascript (i.e. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>). What will the tabs look like in that case?</p>
    <div class="tab">Tab One</div>
  </body>
