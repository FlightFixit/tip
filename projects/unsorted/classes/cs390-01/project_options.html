      <h1>Introduction to Robotics &mdash; Project Options</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Students will be grouped into teams at the beginning of the semester and their <a href="#assignments">assigments</a> fall into three categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Homework &mdash; Performed by the individual student</li>
      <li>Lab &mdash; Performed by a team to concretize learning</li>
      <li>Deliverable &mdash; Performed by a team as an incrimental step toward the final project</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ideally, in order to properly assess the individual student's performace while allowing for a reasonably complex group project, there should be a roughly even balance of homeworks and deliverables. The course will be delivered over 15 weeks, and the spacing and difficulty of assignments should attempt to prevent major spikes in the workload. A particular issue with project-based classes is they tend to culminate with a large amount of work. Each deliverable should ideally build on the previous ones such that the student cannot simply postpone work until the final comprehensive deliverable.</p>
    
    <p>Specific skills that the projects should address are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Navigation</li>
      <li>Localization</li>
      <li>Planning (<em>potentially</em>)</li>
      <li>Vision Recognition</li>
      <li>Behavior-Based Control (Obstacle Avoidance)</li>
      <li>Mapping</li>
      <li>Simple Grasping</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The projects will tentatively use the Lego NXT system after a <a href="index.html#c13">consideration of its capabilities in comparison to VEX</a> and HandyBoard.</p>

    <p>A possible sequence for the class assignments is:</p>

    <p>All of these are acheivable with the basic NXT kit. The reactive and landmarks for reckoning portions could be expanded with a camera for an additional $100.</p>
