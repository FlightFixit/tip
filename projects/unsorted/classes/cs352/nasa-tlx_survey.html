    <p>This Questionnaire will measure your task workload. Below you will find the definitions of six workload factors. You will do the NASA-TLX questionnaire on the computer using the program, TLX.EXE. Its GUI will first ask for your ID; your test administrator can give that to you. It will then ask you to rate each of the factors on a sliding scale. Please click on the scale to represent how low/high or good/poor you felt for each of the factors during the task. The GUI will then go through each of the 15 combinations of 2 factors, asking you which of the two contributed more to your workload during the task. Select one by clicking on its button to move on to the next combination.</p>
