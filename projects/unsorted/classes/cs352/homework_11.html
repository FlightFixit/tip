    <div class="question">
      <p>You have conducted a user evaluation in which two interfaces were compared. You had twenty participants who completed a single task with each interface. You evenly distributed the presentation of the interfaces across the participants (e.g. 10 received A followed by B and 10 received B followed by A). The participants completed two evaluation sessions on two different days. During each session they completed the same tasks with the interfaces in the same presentation order, in other words, this is a repeated measures evaluation. The stated hypothesis was that the users would complete the tasks faster with interface B than they would with interface A. Table 1 provides the task completion times by participant, Interface and session. All times are reported in seconds and were automatically recorded via the interface software in an identical manner for both interfaces, in other words, assume that there are no errors in the recording of the completion times.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <p>Please describe what type of evaluation design has been employed. Is it within or between subjects and why?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The interfaces offered the two different groups were the same for all users. The testing variable was the different performance on the interface for a given test subject. The type of evaluation therefore is within subjects.</p>

      <li>
        <div class="question">
          <p>Would a repeated measures ANOVA allow you to determine if the results support or refute the hypothesis?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The analysis of variance is used when there are independent samples from more than two groups. In this particular test, there are four groups of data, but they are not independant.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">
          <p>How might you use t-tests to analyze the above data in order to support or refute the hypothesis? Why is this application of the t-test appropriate?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Assuming that the populations are normal and the variances are equal, a t-test gives a value that can test if a given null hypothesis is accepted or not. For this particular experiment the experimenter's belief is that the second interface is more effective than the first. In order to emply reject-support testing the null hypothesis, H<sub>0</sub>, is formulated to contradict the experiementer's belief. I.E. for &mu;<sub>1</sub> as the mean time for completion using the first interface and &mu;<sub>2</sub> as the mean time using the second interface, H<sub>0</sub>: &mu;<sub>1</sub> &ge; &mu;<sub>2</sub>.</p>
          <p>The t-test would then attempt to disprove that hypothesis.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <p>Create an appropriate graphical presentation of the information in Table 1. Provide an explanation of what you are attempting to show with the particular graphical visualization and why your visualization supports your intentions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The graphical representation I would produce, had I time, is a bar and whisker plot showing the mean estimated by the t-test for the two interfaces and a 95% confidince interval for each. It would would allow the experimenter to visually verify if their hypothesis is rejected (thereby supporting their belief).</p>
