        <div class="question">
          <p>Using the five-phase framework for textual search (page 567 of the reading) please describe:</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p>How does your cell phone support searching for functionality?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>My phone does not have a textual search for functionality. Functionality is organized hierarchically and available through navigation of menus. Access to functionality is not explicitly stated, but known through ad hoc standard interface assignments (center button to select, clear button to go up a level, end button to leave navigation entierly).</p>
            </div>

          <li>
            <div class="question">
              <p>How does your cell phone support searching for an individual in the contacts list?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>A field is provided for limiting the source. As letters are typed, the source is limited to names beginning with the given string. Phrases and variants are not permitted. The result set is not limited in size. The actions on a given contact are mostly consistent and are accessed through labeled buttons in the interface mapping to keys on the phone.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <p>Below are links to two information visualizations to support decision makers. For each visualization, explain how the visualization supports decisions that need to be made by the individual using them. How specifically does the visualization provide the necessary information?</p>

              <p>Go to <a href="http://www.idashboards.com/financial.shtml">idashboards.com/financial.shtml</a> and select the "Live Dashboard Preview" for the Fraud Management option at the bottom of the page. How can a credit union manager use the provided information to inform decisions at his branch?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <ul>
                <li>He can know whether fraud is on the rise and when it peaks, so as to know whether a current trend is perhaps seasonal or part of an ongoing trend.</li>
                <li>With time and a piece of paper, he can know trends in the false positive rate. A spike in this trend might indicate a need for further examination.</li>
                <li>With time and a piece of paper, he can know trends in the ratio of fraud to total spending. Similarly a spike here should be investigated.</li>
                <li>He can know the total fraud count for various regions of the world (though not trends in that data and not as a percentage of transactions). What he does with this, I don't know.</li>
                <li>He can see trends in the methods where fraud is being committed to know where he is most vulnerable.</li>

                <li>Patient satisfaction by specialization to identify problems</li>
                <li>Number of new patients per doctor to know patient churn. (Don't really understand the numbers.)</li>
                <li>Number of patients to know doctor performance. (Though one really needs to know speciality.)</li>
                <li>Performance on some satisfaction metric. Actual data is hidden somewhere.</li>
