LikeMost: Both of the views were very helpful.
Directing the robots wasn\'t time-consuming in general.
It was easy to understand.

LikeLeast: I would like it if the robots notified the  user faster when they were stuck.
I would like it if the areas of interest would disappear or show that they were completed after they were done.
I would like it if the individual tasks I set each had a progress bar as well as an overall progress bar so I could better manage the time.
Comments: Overall, I liked using this system and found it very easy to use.
