LikeMost: 1. I liked that you could have one robot be completing a task while using another robot to perform another task.

2. I liked being able to use either the mouse or the up and down arrows.

3. I liked the robots\' names and how they were also identified clearly by numbers and colors.
LikeLeast: 1. I did not like that you had nothing other than the red sign on the progress bar to alert you of the robot\'s being stuck while completing a task.

2. It would be nice to have audio accompany the visual aspect.

3. It was hard to determine the entry points to the inside (the trees and sidewalks).
Comments: Overall, the robots were fun to direct. It was definitely more fun as I gained more knowledge. I would sit and play for a while if I had the time.
