So...  Is this getting out of hand?  This is the same old flame war that these
two have been getting into since time immemorial...  Should we say something to
them?

*sigh* William, can you ditch the hostile attitude? I really am not in
the mood for more of that crap this year. It isn't necessary. Telling
someone that they're speaking in platitudes or catch-phrases promoted
by an organization is not the way to win friends or influence people
:)

How do you know that what ed posted isn't his actual opinion? Based on
my knowledge of the good dr. lisic, i don't see that as being out of
the question.

you know what the government is? a bunch of people. perhaps you don't
grasp that yet. in order for the "government" to "turn against us", a
significant portion of the population would have to have a major
difference of opinion.

the meme of "big nasty militaristic government" doesn't work. its not
scary, unless you're short-sighted and forget that the military is at
least a *somewhat* representative sample of the population.

i'll admit that the socioeconomic makeup of the military doesn't match
that of the rest of society- BUT, in general, the desires of the
average GI are going to meet up with what the masses want. if it were
a major conflict of interest, we'd be seeing a lot of AWOL soldiers
and mutinous behavior. unquestionably.

Umm. You have that freedom. Assuming you have multiple million dollars
just sitting around to buy stuff... :)

the government doesn't seem to sell munitions, but they *do* sell surplus
aircraft...
:)

and what about all those sales to foreign governments? big money talks.

can you show me a law that says you can't own a B1B bomber? or an F-14? i kinda
doubt it, although you may prove me wrong.

It wasn't hostile, it was glib. If you're predisposed to see anything
I write on here as hostile because of discussions I've had in the
past, I can't help you.

Maybe, but I'm trying to call a person on the fact that in a whole
post they (maybe) said one thing, and wasted all those helpless bytes
in the process.

Actually, that was Matt Couch I was responding to. Dr. Ed just asked a
question, he didn't pretend to give an answer.

It doesn't matter. If you believe for one minute that a country's
leader(s) can't turn against them in the blink of an eye, then we're
probably too far gone anyway. Think of Germany, Russia, China, Japan,
Rome, etc.

The military is segregated - to a large degree - from the rest of
society. They can be brainwashed to believe that they are fighting the
Red Menace. I'm not saying it's happenning, I just accept that it can,
and that if it did there's nothing the citizens could do about it.

Right now. At this moment in time. If we don't look to the
possibilities of the future, we're doomed to the same fate of all the
other large, wealthy civilizations of the past: failure.

No. We only sell that stuff to our allies. The main point, though, is
that there isn't enough money to buy as many of those weapons as the
US Gov't has at its disposal, and that it would be at the sufferance
of the US Gov't to sell those things to people. I mean, you could go
buy one of China's liquid-fueled single-warhead missles and try to
smuggle it into the country, but what good would that be against the
US's 3-stage, solid-fueled, multiple warhead ICBM's?

Oh, goody! I can have an F-15 that isn't working? That ought to stop them!

Foreign ally governments. We aren't selling our JSF's to China, or
Russia, or anyone we consider to be "dangerous," and we probably won't
be selling them to the Brits or the French or anyone until 1) they
come out, and 2) we have something better.

Dude. There doesn't have to be a law. The US Gov't has a monopoly on
the production capabilities of those aircraft, our tanks, etc. They
won't sell them to a private citizen.

I was just trying to create a catch-phrase.

You'll have to forgive me, I was caught up in the moment, you know.
