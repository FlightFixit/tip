<h1>The Little Goddess</h1>
<h2>by Ian McDonald</h2>
<h3>from <cite>The Year's Best Science Fiction 23rd Annual Collection</cite> (2006)</h3>

<p><i>Ian McDonald, who has lived in Northern Ireland for most of his life, works in program development for an independent television production company. His most recent book is River of Gods, from Simon and Schuster (UK). The novel is set in a kaleidoscopic India one hundred years after independence. He tells us, <q>It was while researching River, on a side-trip up into Nepal, that I first encountered, and was fascinated by, the Kumari Devi.</q></i></p>

<hr />

<p>I remember the night I became a goddess.</p>

<p>The men collected me from the hotel at sunset. I was light-headed with hunger, for the child-assessors said I must not eat on the day of the test. I had been up since dawn; the washing and dressing and making up were a long and tiring business. My parents bathed my feet in the bidet. We had never seen such a thing before and that seemed the natural use for it. None of us had ever stayed in a hotel. We thought it most grand, though I see now that it was a budget tourist chain. I remember the smell of onions cooking in <i>ghee</i> as I came down in the elevator. It smelled like the best food in the world.</p>

<p>I know the men must have been priests but I cannot remember if they wore formal dress. My mother cried in the lobby; my father&rsquo;s mouth was pulled in and he held his eyes wide, in that way that grown-ups do when they want to cry but cannot let tears be seen. There were two other girls for the test staying in the same hotel. I did not know them; they were from other villages where the <i>devi</i> could live. Their parents wept unashamedly. I could not understand it; their daughters might be goddesses.</p>

<p>On the street, rickshaw drivers and pedestrians hooted and waved at us with our red robes and third eyes on our foreheads. The <i>devi</i>, the <i>devi</i> look! Best of all fortune! The other girls held on tight to the men&rsquo;s hands. I lifted my skirts and stepped into the car with the darkened windows.</p>

<p>They took us to the Hanumandhoka. Police and machines kept the people out of the Durbar Square. I remember staring long at the machines, with their legs like steel chickens&rsquo; and naked blades in their hands. The King&rsquo;s Own fighting machines. Then I saw the temple and its great roofs sweeping up and up and up into the red sunset and I thought for one instant the upturned eaves were bleeding.</p>

<p>The room was long and dim and stuffily warm. Low evening light shone in dusty rays through cracks and slits in the carved wood; so bright it almost burned. Outside you could hear the traffic and the bustle of tourists. The walls seemed thin but at the same time kilometers thick. Durbar Square was a world away. The room smelled of brassy metal. I did not recognize it then but I know it now as the smell of blood. Beneath the blood was another smell, of time piled thick as dust. One of the two women who would be my guardians if I passed the test told me the temple was five hundred years old. She was a short, round woman with a face that always seemed to be smiling, but when you looked closely you saw it was not. She made us sit on the floor on red cushions while the men brought the rest of the girls. Some of them were crying already. When there were ten of us the two women left and the door was closed. We sat for a long time in the heat of the long room. Some of the girls fidgeted and chattered but I gave all my attention to the wall carvings and soon I was lost. It has always been easy for me to lose myself; in Shakya I could disappear for hours in the movement of clouds across the mountain, in the ripple of the grey river far below, and the flap of the prayer banner in the wind. My parents saw it as a sign of my inborn divinity, one of the thirty-two that mark those girls in whom the goddess may dwell.</p>

<p>In the failing light I read the story of Jayaprakash Malla playing dice with the <i>devi</i> Taleju Bhawani who came to him in the shape of a red snake and left with the vow that she would only return to the Kings of Kathmandu as a virgin girl of low caste, to spite their haughtiness. I could not read its end in the darkness, but I did not need to. I was its end, or one of the other nine low-caste girls in the god-house of the <i>devi</i>.</p>

<p>Then the doors burst open wide and firecrackers exploded and through the rattle and smoke red demons leaped into the hall. Behind them men in crimson beat pans and clappers and bells. At once two of the girls began to cry and the two women came and took them away. But I knew the monsters were just silly men. In masks. These were not even close to demons. I have seen demons, after the rain clouds when the light comes low down the valley and all the mountains leap up as one. Stone demons, kilometers high. I have heard their voices, and their breath does not smell like onions. The silly men danced close to me, shaking their red manes and red tongues, but I could see their eyes behind the painted holes and they were afraid of me.</p>

<p>Then the door banged open again with another crash of fireworks and more men came through the smoke. They carried baskets draped with red sheets. They set them in front of us and whipped away the coverings. Buffalo heads, so freshly struck off the blood was bright and glossy. Eyes rolled up, lolling tongues still warm, noses still wet. And the flies, swarming around the severed neck. A man pushed a basket towards me on my cushion as if it were a dish of holy food. The crashing and beating outside rose to a roar, so loud and metallic it hurt. The girl from my own Shakya village started to wail; the cry spread to another and then another, then a fourth. The other woman, the tall pinched one with a skin like an old purse, came in to take them out, carefully lifting her gown so as not to trail it in the blood. The dancers whirled around like flame and the kneeling man lifted the buffalo head from the basket. He held it up in my face, eye to eye, but all I thought was that it must weigh a lot; his muscles stood out like vines, his arm shook. The flies looked like black jewels. Then there was a clap from outside and the men set down the heads and covered them up with their cloths and they left with the silly demon men whirling and leaping around them.</p>

<p>There was one other girl left on her cushion now. I did not know her. She was of a Vajryana family from Niwar down the valley. We sat a long time, wanting to talk but not knowing if silence was part of the trial. Then the door opened a third time and two men led a white goat into the <i>devi</i> hall. They brought it right between me and the Niwari girl. I saw its wicked, slotted eye roll. One held the goat&rsquo;s tether, the other took a big ceremonial <i>kukri</i> from a leather sheath. He blessed it and with one fast strong stroke sent the goat&rsquo;s head leaping from its body.</p>

<p>I almost laughed, for the goat looked so funny, its body not knowing where its head was, the head looking around for the body and then the body realizing that it had no head and going down with a kick, and why was the Niwari girl screaming, couldn&rsquo;t she see how funny it was, or was she screaming because I saw the joke and she was jealous of that? Whatever her reason, smiling woman and weathered woman came and took her very gently away and the two men went down on their knees in the spreading blood and kissed the wooden floor. They lifted away the two parts of the goat. I wished they hadn&rsquo;t done that. I would have liked someone with me in the big wooden hall. But I was on my own in the heat and the dark and then, over the traffic, I heard the deep-voiced bells of Kathmandu start to swing and ring. For the last time the doors opened and there were the women, in the light.</p>

<p><q>Why have you left me all alone?</q> I cried. <q>What have I done wrong?</q></p>

<p><q>How could you do anything wrong, goddess?</q> said the old, wrinkled woman who, with her colleague, would become my mother and father and teacher and sister. <q>Now come along with us and hurry. The King is waiting.</q></p>

<p>Smiling Kumarima and Tall Kumarima (as I would now have to think of them) took a hand each and led me, skipping, from the great looming Hanuman temple. A road of white silk had been laid from the foot of the temple steps to a wooden palace close by. The people had been let&nbsp; into the square and they pressed on either side of the processional way, held back by the police and the King&rsquo;s robots. The machines held burning torches in their grasping hands. Fire glinted from their killing blades. There was great silence in the dark square.</p>

<p><q>Your home, goddess,</q> said Smiling Kumarima, bending low to whisper in my ear. <q>Walk the silk, <i>devi</i>. Do not stray off it. I have your hand, you will be safe with me.</q></p>

<p>I walked between my Kumarimas, humming a pop tune I had heard on the radio at the hotel. When I looked back I saw that I had left two lines of bloody footprints.</p>

<br/>

<p>You have no caste, no village, no home. This palace is your home, and who would wish for any other? We have made it lovely for you, for you will only leave it six times a year. Everything you need is here within these walls.</p>

<p>You have no mother or father. How can a goddess have parents? Nor have you brothers and sisters. The King is your brother, the kingdom your sister. The priests who attend on you, they are nothing. We your Kumarimas are less than nothing. Dust, dirt, a tool. You may say anything and we must obey it.</p>

<p>As we have said, you will leave the palace only six times a year. You will be carried in a palanquin. Oh, it is a beautiful thing, carved wood and silk. Outside this palace you shall not touch the ground. The moment you touch the ground, you cease to be divine.</p>

<p>You will wear red, with your hair in a topknot and your toe- and fingernails painted. You will carry the red <i>tilak</i> of Siva on your forehead. We will help you with your preparations until they become second nature.</p>

<p>You will speak only within the confines of your palace, and little even then. Silence becomes the Kumari. You will not smile or show any emotion.</p>

<p>You will not bleed. Not a scrape, not a scratch. The power is in the blood and when the blood leaves, the <i>devi</i> leaves. On the day of your first blood, even one single drop, we will tell the priest and he will inform the King that the goddess has left. You will no longer be divine and you will leave this palace and return to your family. You will not bleed.</p>

<p>You have no name. You are Taleju, you are Kumari. You are the goddess.</p>

<p>These instructions my two Kumarimas whispered to me as we walked between kneeling priests to the King in his plumed crown of diamonds and emeralds and pearls. The King <i>namasted</i> and we sat side by side on lion thrones and the long hall throbbed to the bells and drums of Durbar Square. I remember thinking that a King must bow to me but there are rules even for goddesses.</p>

<p>Smiling Kumarima and Tall Kumarima. I draw Tall Kumarima in my memory first, for it is right to give pre-eminence to age. She was almost as tall as a Westerner and thin as a stick in a drought. At first I was scared of her. Then I heard her voice and could never be scared again; her voice was kind as a singing bird. When she spoke you felt you now knew everything. Tall Kumarima lived in a small apartment above a tourist shop on the edge of Durbar Square. From her window she could see my Kumari Ghar, among the stepped towers of the <i>dhokas</i>. Her husband had died of lung cancer from pollution and cheap Indian cigarettes. Her two tall sons were grown and married with children of their own, older than me. In that time she had mothered five Kumari <i>Devi</i>s before me.</p>

<p>Next I remember Smiling Kumarima. She was short and round and had breathing problems for which she used inhalers, blue and brown. I would hear the snake hiss of them on days when Durbar Square was golden with smog. She lived out in the new suburbs up on the western hills, a long journey even by the royal car at her service. Her children were twelve, ten, nine, and seven. She was jolly and treated me like her fifth baby, the young favorite, but I felt even then that, like the demon-dancing-men, she was scared of me. Oh, it was the highest honor any woman could hope for, to be the mother of the goddess&mdash;so to speak&mdash;though you wouldn&rsquo;t think it to hear her neighbors in the unit, <i>shutting yourself away in that dreadful wooden box, and all the blood, medieval, medieval,</i> but they couldn&rsquo;t understand. Somebody had to keep the king safe against those who would turn us into another India, or worse, China; someone had to preserve the old ways of the divine kingdom. I understood early that difference between them. Smiling Kumarima was my mother out of duty. Tall Kumarima from love.</p>

<p>I never learned their true names. Their rhythms and cycles of shifts waxed and waned through the days and nights like the faces of the moon. Smiling Kumarima once found me looking up through the lattice of a <i>jali</i> screen at the fat moon on a rare night when the sky was clear and healthy and shouted me away, <i>don&rsquo;t be looking at that thing, it will call the blood out of you, little devi, and you will be the devi no more</i>.</p>

<p>Within the wooden walls and iron rules of my Kumari Ghar, years become indistinguishable, indistinct. I think now I was five when I became Taleju <i>Devi</i>. The year, I believe, was 2034. But some memories break the surface, like flowers through snow.</p>

<p>Monsoon rain on the steep-sloped roofs, water rushing and gurgling through the gutters, and the shutter that every year blew loose and rattled in the wind. We had monsoons, then. Thunder demons in the mountains around the city, my room flash lit with lightning. Tall Kumarima came to see if I needed singing to sleep but I was not afraid. A goddess cannot fear a storm.</p>

<p>The day I went walking in the little garden, when Smiling Kumarima let out a cry and fell at my feet on the grass and the words to tell her to get up, not to worship me were on my lips when she held, between thumb and forefinger, twisting and writhing and trying to find a place for its mouth to seize: a green leech.</p>

<p>The morning Tall Kumarima came to tell me people had asked me to show myself. At first I had thought it wonderful that people would want to come and look at me on my little <i>jharoka</i> balcony in my clothes and paint and jewels. Now I found it tiresome; all those round eyes and gaping mouths. It was a week after my tenth birthday. I remember Tall Kumarima smiled but tried not to let me see. She took me to the <i>jharoka</i> to wave to the people in the court and I saw a hundred Chinese faces upturned to me, then the high, excited voices. I waited and waited but two tourists would not go away. They were an ordinary couple, dark local faces, country clothes.</p>

<p><q>Why are they keeping us waiting?</q> I asked.</p>

<p><q>Wave to them,</q> Tall Kumarima urged. <q>That is all they want.</q> The woman saw my lifted hand first. She went weak and grabbed her husband by the arm. The man bent to her, then looked up at me. I read many emotions on that face; shock, confusion, recognition, revulsion, wonder, hope. Fear. I waved and the man tugged at his wife, <i>look, look up</i>. I remember that against all the laws, I smiled. The woman burst into tears. The man made to call out but Tall Kumarima hastened me away.</p>

<p><q>Who were those funny people?</q> I asked. <q>They were both wearing very white shoes.</q></p>

<p><q>Your mother and father,</q> Tall Kumarima said. As she led me down the Durga corridor with the usual order not to brush my free hand along the wooden walls for fear of splinters, I felt her grip tremble.</p>

<p>That night I dreamed the dream of my life, that is not a dream but one of my earliest experiences, knocking and knocking and knocking at the door of my remembering. This was a memory I would not admit in daylight, so it must come by night, to the secret door.</p>

<p>I am in the cage over a ravine. A river runs far below, milky with mud and silt, foaming cream over the boulders and slabs sheared from the mountainsides. The cable spans the river from my home to the summer grazing and I sit in the wire cage used to carry the goats across the river. At my back is the main road, always loud with trucks, the prayer banners and Kinley bottled water sign of my family&rsquo;s roadside teahouse. My cage still sways from my uncle&rsquo;s last kick. I see him, arms and legs wrapped around the wire, grinning his gap-toothed grin. His face is summer-burned brown, his hands cracked and stained from the trucks he services. Oil engrained in the creases. He wrinkles up his nose at me and unhooks a leg to kick my cage forward on its pulley-wheel. Pulley sways cable sways mountains, sky and river sway but I am safe in my little goat-cage. I have been kicked across this ravine many times. My uncle inches forward. Thus we cross the river, by kicks and inches.</p>

<p>I never see what strikes him&mdash;some thing of the brain perhaps, like the sickness Lowlanders get when they go up to the high country. But the next I look my uncle is clinging to the wire by his right arm and leg. His left arm and leg hang down, shaking like a cow with its throat cut, shaking the wire and my little cage. I am three years old and I think this is funny, a trick my uncle is doing just for me, so I shake back, bouncing my cage, bouncing my uncle up and down, up and down. Half his body will not obey him and he tries to move forward by sliding his leg along, like <i>this</i>, jerk his hand forward <i>quick</i> so he never loses grip of the wire, and all the while bouncing up and down, up and down. Now my uncle tries to shout but his words are noise and slobber because half his face is paralyzed. Now I see his fingers lose their grip on the wire. Now I see him spin round and his hooked leg come free. Now he falls away, half his body reaching, half his mouth screaming. I see him fall, I see him bounce from the rocks and cartwheel, a thing I have always wished I could do. I see him go into the river and the brown water swallow him.</p>

<p>My older brother came out with a hook and a line and hauled me in. When my parents found I was not shrieking, not a sob or a tear or even a pout, that was when they knew I was destined to become the goddess. I was smiling in my wire cage.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I remember best the festivals, for it was only then that I left the Kumari Ghar. Dasain, at the end of summer, was the greatest. For eight days the city ran red. On the final night I lay awake listening to the voices in the square flow together into one roar, the way I imagined the sea would sound, the voices of the men gambling for the luck of Lakshmi, <i>devi</i> of wealth. My father and uncles had gambled on the last night of Dasain. I remember I came down and demanded to know what all the laughing was about and they turned away from their cards and really laughed. I had not thought there could be so many coins in the world as there were on that table but it was nothing compared to Kathmandu on the eighth of Dasain. Smiling Kumarima told me it took some of the priests all year to earn back what they lost. Then came the ninth day, the great day and I sailed out from my palace for the city to worship me.</p>

<p>I traveled on a litter carried by forty men strapped to bamboo poles as thick as my body. They went gingerly, testing every step, for the streets were slippery. Surrounded by gods and priests and <i>saddhus</i> mad with holiness, I rode on my golden throne. Closer to me than any were my Kumarimas, my two Mothers, so splendid and ornate in their red robes and headdresses and make-up they did not look like humans at all. But Tall Kumarima&rsquo;s voice and Smiling Kumarima&rsquo;s smile assured me as I rode with Hanuman and Taleju through the cheering and the music and the banners bright against the blue sky and the smell I now recognized from the night I became a goddess, the smell of blood.</p>

<p>That Dasain the city received me as never before. The roar of the night of Lakshmi continued into the day. As Taleju <i>Devi</i> I was not supposed to notice anything as low as humans but out of the corners of my painted eyes I could see beyond the security robots stepping in time with my bearers, and the streets radiating out from the <i>stupa</i> of Chhetrapati were solid with bodies. They threw jets and gushes of water from plastic bottles up into the air, glittering, breaking into little rainbows, raining down on them, soaking them, but they did not care. Their faces were crazy with devotion.</p>

<p>Tall Kumarima saw my puzzlement and bent to whisper.</p>

<p><q>They do <i>puja</i> for the rain. The monsoon has failed a second time, <i>devi</i>.</q></p>

<p>As I spoke, Smiling Kumarima fanned me so no one would see my lips move. <q>We don&rsquo;t like the rain,</q> I said firmly.</p>

<p><q>A goddess cannot do only what she likes,</q> Tall Kumarima said. <q>It is a serious matter. The people have no water. The rivers are running dry.</q></p>

<p>I thought of the river that ran far down deep below the house where I was born, the water creamy and gushing and flecked with yellow foam. I saw it swallow my uncle and could not imagine it ever becoming thin, weak, hungry.</p>

<p><q>So why do they throw water then?</q> I asked.</p>

<p><q>So the <i>devi</i> will give them more,</q> Smiling Kumarima explained. But I could not see the sense in that even for goddesses and I frowned, trying to understand how humans were and so I was looking right at him when he came at me.</p>

<p>He had city-pale skin and hair parted on the left that flopped as he dived out of the crowd. He moved his fists to the collar of his diagonally striped shirt and people surged away from him. I saw him hook his thumbs into two loops of black string. I saw his mouth open in a great cry. Then the machine swooped and I saw a flash of silver. The young man&rsquo;s head flew up into the air. His mouth and eyes went round: from a cry to an oh! The King&rsquo;s Own machine had sheathed its blade, like a boy folding a knife, before the body, like that funny goat in the Hanumandhoka, realized it was dead and fell to the ground. The crowd screamed and tried to get away from the headless thing. My bearers rocked, swayed, uncertain where to go, what to do. For a moment I thought they might drop me.</p>

<p>Smiling Kumarima let out little shrieks of horror, <q>Oh! Oh! Oh!</q> My face was spotted with blood.</p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s not hers,</q> Tall Kumarima shouted. <q>It&rsquo;s not hers!</q> She moistened a handkerchief with a lick of saliva. She was gently wiping the young man&rsquo;s blood from my face when the Royal security in their dark suits and glasses arrived, beating through the crowd. They lifted me, stepped over the body and carried me to the waiting car.</p>

<p><q>You smudged my make-up,</q> I said to the Royal guard as the car swept away. Worshippers barely made it out of our way in the narrow alleys.</p>

<p>Tall Kumarima came to my room that night. The air was loud with helicopters, quartering the city for the plotters. Helicopters, and machines like the King&rsquo;s Own robots, that could fly and look down on Kathmandu with the eyes of a hawk. She sat on my bed and laid a little transparent blue box on the red and gold embroidered coverlet. In it were two pale pills.</p>

<p><q>To help you sleep.</q></p>

<p>I shook my head. Tall Kumarima folded the blue box into the sleeve of her robe.</p>

<p><q>Who was he?</q></p>

<p><q>A fundamentalist. A <i>karsevak</i>. A foolish, sad young man.</q></p>

<p><q>A Hindu, but he wanted to hurt us.</q></p>

<p><q>That is the madness of it, <i>devi</i>. He and his kind think our kingdom has grown too western, too far from its roots and religious truths.</q></p>

<p><q>And he attacks us, the Taleju <i>Devi</i>. He would have blown up his own goddess, but the machine took his head. That is almost as strange as people throwing water to the rain.</q></p>

<p>Tall Kumarima bowed her head. She reached inside the sash of her robe and took out a second object which she set on my heavy cover with the same precise care as she had the sleeping pills. It was a light, fingerless glove, for the right hand; clinging to its back was a curl of plastic shaped like a very very tiny goat fetus.</p>

<p><q>Do you know what this is?</q></p>

<p>I nodded. Every devotee doing <i>puja</i> in the streets seemed to own one, right hands held up to snatch my image. A palmer.</p>

<p><q>It sends messages into your head,</q> I whispered.</p>

<p><q>That is the least of what it can do, <i>devi</i>. Think of it like your <i>jharoka</i>, but this window opens onto the world beyond Durbar Square, beyond Kathmandu and Nepal. It is an aeai, an artificial intelligence, a thinking-thing, like the machines up there, but much cleverer than them. They are clever enough to fly and hunt and not much else, but this aeai can tell you anything you want to know. All you have to do is ask. And there are things you need to know, <i>devi</i>. You will not be Kumari forever. The day will come when you will leave your palace and go back to the world. I have seen them before you.</q> She reached out to take my face between her hands, then drew back. <q>You are special, my <i>devi</i>, but the kind of special it takes to be Kumari means you will find it hard in the world. People will call it a sickness. Worse than that, even &hellip;</q></p>

<p>She banished the emotion by gently fitting the fetus-shaped receiver behind my ear. I felt the plastic move against my skin, then Tall Kumarima slipped on the glove, waved her hand in a <i>mudra</i> and I heard her voice inside my head. Glowing words appeared in the air between us, words I had been painstakingly taught to read by Tall Kumarima.</p>

<p><i>Don&rsquo;t let anyone find it</i>, her dancing hand said. <i>Tell no one, not even Smiling Kumarima. I know you call her that, but she would not understand. She would think it was unclean, a pollution. In some ways, she is not so different from that man who tried to harm you. Let this be our secret, just you and me.</i></p>

<p>Soon after, Smiling Kumarima came to look in on me and check for fleas, but I pretended to be asleep. The glove and the fetus-thing were hidden under my pillow. I imagined them talking to me through the goose down and soft soft cotton, sending dreams while the helicopters and hunting robots wheeled in the night above me. When the latch on her door clicked too, I put on the glove and earhook and went looking for the lost rain. I found it one hundred and fifty kilometers up, through the eye of a weather aeai spinning over east India. I saw the monsoon, a coil of cloud like a cat&rsquo;s claw hooking up across the sea. There had been cats in the village; suspicious things lean on mice and barley. No cat was permitted in the Kumari Ghar. I looked down on my kingdom but I could not see a city or a palace or me down here at all. I saw mountains, white mountains ridged with grey and blue ice. I was goddess of this. And the heart went out of me, because it was nothing, a tiny crust of stone on top of that huge world that hung beneath it like the full teat of a cow, rich and heavy with people and their brilliant cities and their bright nations. India, where our gods and names were born.</p>

<p>Within three days the police had caught the plotters and it was raining. The clouds were low over Kathmandu. The color ran from the temples in Durbar Square but people beat tins and metal cups in the muddy streets calling praise on the Taleju <i>Devi</i>.</p>

<p><q>What will happen to them?</q> I asked Tall Kumarima. <q>The bad men.</q></p>

<p><q>They will likely be hanged,</q> she said.</p>

<p>That autumn after the executions of the traitors the dissatisfaction finally poured on to the streets like sacrificial blood. Both sides claimed me: police and demonstrators. Others yet held me up as both the symbol of all that was good with our Kingdom and also everything wrong with it. Tall Kumarima tried to explain it to me but with my world mad and dangerous my attention was turned elsewhere, to the huge, old land to the south, spread out like a jeweled skirt. In such a time it was easy to be seduced by the terrifying depth of its history, by the gods and warriors who swept across it, empire after empire after empire. My kingdom had always been fierce and free but I met the men who liberated India from the Last Empire&mdash;men like gods&mdash;and saw that liberty broken up by rivalry and intrigue and corruption into feuding states; Awadh and Bharat, the United States of Bengal, Maratha, Karnataka.</p>

<p>Legendary names and places. Shining cities as old as history. There aeais haunted the crowded streets like <i>gandhavas</i>. There men outnumbered women four to one. There the old distinctions were abandoned and women married as far up and men as few steps down the tree of caste as they could. I became as enthralled by their leaders and parties and politics as any of their citizens by the aeai-generated soaps they loved so dearly. My spirit was down in India in that early, hard winter when the police and King&rsquo;s machines restored the old order to the city beyond Durbar Square. Unrest in earth and the three heavens. One day I woke to find snow in the wooden court; the roofs of the temple of Durbar Square heavy with it, like frowning, freezing old men. I knew now that the strange weather was not my doing but the result of huge, slow changes in the climate. Smiling Kumarima came to me in my <i>jharoka</i> as I watched flakes thick and soft as ash sift down from the white sky. She knelt before me, rubbed her hands together inside the cuffs of her wide sleeves. She suffered badly in the cold and damp.</p>

<p><q><i>Devi</i>, are you not one of my own children to me?</q></p>

<p>I waggled my head, not wanting to say yes.</p>

<p><q><i>Devi</i>, have I ever, ever given you anything but my best?</q></p>

<p>Like her counterpart a season before, she drew a plastic pillbox from her sleeve, set it on her palm. I sat back on my chair, afraid of it as I had never been afraid of anything Tall Kumarima offered me.</p>

<p><q>I know how happy we are all here, but change must always happen. Change in the world, like this snow&mdash;unnatural, <i>devi,</i> not right&mdash;change in our city. And we are not immune to it in here, my flower. Change will come to you, <i>devi</i>. To you, to your body. You will become a woman. If I could, I would stop it happening to you, <i>devi</i>. But I can&rsquo;t. No one can. What I can offer is &hellip; a delay. A stay. Take these. They will slow down the changes. For years, hopefully. Then we can all be happy here together, <i>devi</i>.</q> She looked up from her deferential half-bow, into my eyes. She smiled. <q>Have I ever wanted anything but the best for you?</q></p>

<p>I held out my hand. Smiling Kumarima tipped the pills into my palm. I closed my fist and slipped from my carved throne. As I went to my room, I could hear Smiling Kumarima chanting prayers of thanksgiving to the goddesses in the carvings. I looked at the pills in my hand. Blue seemed such a wrong color. Then I filled my cup in my little washroom and washed them down, two gulps, down, down.</p>

<p>After that they came every day, two pills, blue as the Lord Krishna, appearing as miraculously on my bedside table. For some reason I never told Tall Kumarima, even when she commented on how fractious I was becoming, how strangely inattentive and absent-minded at ceremonies. I told her it was the <i>devi</i>s in the walls, whispering to me. I knew enough of my specialness, that others have called my <i>disorder</i>, that that would be unquestioned. I was tired and lethargic that winter. My sense of smell grew keen to the least odor and the people in my courtyard with their stupid, beaming upturned faces infuriated me. I went for weeks without showing myself. The wooden corridors grew sharp and brassy with old blood. With the insight of demons, I can see now that my body was a chemical battlefield between my own hormones and Smiling Kumarima&rsquo;s puberty suppressants. It was a heavy, humid spring that year and I felt huge and bloated in the heat, a waddling bulb of fluids under my robes and waxy make-up. I started to drop the little blue pills down the commode. I had been Kumari for seven Dasains.</p>

<p>I had thought I would feel like I used to, but I did not. It was not unwell, like the pills had made me feel, it was sensitive, acutely conscious of my body. I would lie in my wooden bed and feel my legs growing longer. I became very very aware of my tiny nipples. The heat and humidity got worse, or so it seemed to me.</p>

<p>At any time I could have opened my palmer and asked it what was happening to me, but I didn&rsquo;t. I was scared that it might tell me it was the end of my divinity.</p>

<p>Tall Kumarima must have noticed that the hem of my gown no longer brushed the floorboards but it was Smiling Kumarima drew back in the corridor as we hurried towards the <i>darshan</i> hall, hesitated a moment, said, softly, smiling as always,</p>

<p><q>How you&rsquo;re growing, <i>devi</i>. Are you still&hellip; ? No, forgive me, of course&hellip;. Must be this warm weather we&rsquo;re having, makes children shoot up like weeds. My own are bursting out of everything they own, nothing will fit them.</q></p>

<p>The next morning as I was dressing a tap came on my door, like the scratch of a mouse or the click of an insect.</p>

<p><q><i>Devi</i>?</q></p>

<p>No insect, no mouse. I froze, palmer in hand, earhook babbling the early morning news reports from Awadh and Bharat into my head.</p>

<p><q>We are dressing.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, <i>devi</i>, that is why I would like to come in.</q></p>

<p>I just managed to peel off the palmer and stuff it under my mattress before the heavy door swung open on its pivot.</p>

<p><q>We have been able to dress ourselves since we were six,</q> I retorted.</p>

<p><q>Yes, indeed,</q> said Smiling Kumarima, smiling. <q>But some of the priests have mentioned to me a little laxness in the ritual dress.</q></p>

<p>I stood in my red and gold night-robe, stretched out my arms and turned, like one of the trance-dancers I saw in the streets from my litter. Smiling Kumarima sighed.</p>

<p><q><i>Devi</i>, you know as well as I &hellip;</q></p>

<p>I pulled my gown up over my head and stood unclothed, daring her to look, to search my body for signs of womanhood.</p>

<p><q>See?</q> I challenged.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> Smiling Kumarima said, <q>but what is that behind your ear?</q></p>

<p>She reached to pluck the hook. It was in my fist in a flick.</p>

<p><q>Is that what I think it is?</q> Smiling Kumarima said, soft smiling bulk filling the space between the door and me. <q>Who gave you that?</q></p>

<p><q>It is ours,</q> I declared in my most commanding voice but I was a naked twelve-year-old caught in wrongdoing and that commands less than dust.</p>

<p><q>Give it to me.</q></p>

<p>I clenched my fist tighter.</p>

<p><q>We are a goddess, you cannot command us.</q></p>

<p><q>A goddess is as a goddess acts and right now, you are acting like a brat. Show me.</q></p>

<p>She was a mother, I was her child. My fingers unfolded. Smiling Kumarima recoiled as if I held a poisonous snake. To her eyes of her faith, I did.</p>

<p><q>Pollution,</q> she said faintly. <q>Spoiled, all spoiled.</q> Her voice rose. <q>I know who gave you this!</q> Before my fingers could snap shut, she snatched the coil of plastic from my palm. She threw the earhook to the floor as if it burned her. I saw the hem of her skirt raise, I saw the heel come down, but it was my world, my oracle, my window on the beautiful. I dived to rescue the tiny plastic fetus. I remember no pain, no shock, not even Smiling Kumarima&rsquo;s shriek of horror and fear as her heel came down, but I will always see the tip of my right index finger burst in a spray of red blood.</p>

<br/>

<p>The <i>pallav</i> of my yellow sari flapped in the wind as I darted through the Delhi evening crush-hour. Beating the heel of his hand off his buzzer, the driver of the little wasp-colored <i>phatphat</i> cut in between a lumbering truck-train painted with gaudy gods and <i>apsaras</i> and a cream Government Maruti and pulled into the great <i>chakra</i> of traffic around Connaught Place. In Awadh you drive with your ears. The roar of horns and klaxons and cycle-rickshaw bells assailed from all sides at once. It rose before the dawn birds and only fell silent well after midnight. The driver skirted a <i>saddhu</i> walking through the traffic as calmly as if he were wading through the Holy Yamuna. His body was white with sacred ash, a mourning ghost, but his Siva trident burned blood red in the low sun. I had thought Kathmandu dirty, but Delhi&rsquo;s golden light and incredible sunsets spoke of pollution beyond even that. Huddled in the rear seat of the autorickshaws with Deepti, I wore a smog mask and goggles to protect my delicate eye make-up. But the fold of my sari flapped over my shoulder in the evening wind and the little silver bells jingled.</p>

<p>There were six in our little fleet. We accelerated along the wide avenues of the British Raj, past the sprawling red buildings of old India, toward the glass spires of Awadh. Black kites circled the towers, scavengers, pickers of the dead. We turned beneath cool <i>neem</i> trees into the drive of a government bungalow. Burning torches lit us to the pillared porch. House staff in Rajput uniforms escorted us to the <i>shaadi</i> marquee.</p>

<p>Mamaji had arrived before any of us. She fluttered and fretted among her birds; a lick, a rub, a straightening, an admonition. <q>Stand up stand up, we&rsquo;ll have no slumping here. My girls will be the bonniest at this <i>shaadi</i>, hear me?</q> Shweta, her bony, mean-mouthed assistant, collected our smog-masks. <q>Now girls, palmers ready.</q> We knew the drill with almost military smartness. Hand up, glove on, rings on, hook behind ear jewelry, decorously concealed by the fringed <i>dupattas</i> draped over our heads. <q>We are graced with Awadh&rsquo;s finest tonight. Cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me.</q> I barely blinked as the r&eacute;sum&eacute;s rolled up my inner vision. <q>Right girls, from the left, first dozen, two minutes each then on to the next down the list. Quick smart!</q> Mamaji clapped her hands and we formed a line. A band struck a medley of musical numbers from <i>Town and Country</i>, the soap opera that was a national obsession in sophisticated Awadh. There we stood, twelve little wives-a-waiting while the Rajput servants hauled up the rear of the pavilion.</p>

<p>Applause broke around us like rain. A hundred men stood in a rough semi-circle, clapping enthusiastically, faces bright in the light from the carnival lanterns.</p>

<p>When I arrived in Awadh, the first thing I noticed was the people. People pushing people begging people talking people rushing past each other without a look or a word or an acknowledgement. I had thought Kathmandu held more people than a mind could imagine. I had not seen Old Delhi. The constant noise, the everyday callousness, the lack of any respect appalled me. You could vanish into that crowd of faces like a drop of rain into a tank. The second thing I noticed was that the faces were all men. It was indeed as my palmer had whispered to me. There were four men for every woman.</p>

<p>Fine men good men clever men rich men, men of ambition and career and property, men of power and prospects. Men with no hope of ever marrying within their own class and caste. Men with little prospect of marrying ever. <i>Shaadi</i> had once been the word for wedding festivities, the groom on his beautiful white horse, so noble, the bride shy and lovely behind her golden veil. Then it became a name for dating agencies: <i>lovely wheat-complexioned Agarwal, U.S.-university MBA, seeks same civil service/military for matrimonials</i>. Now it was a bride-parade, a marriage-market for lonely men with large dowries. Dowries that paid a hefty commission to the Lovely Girl <i>Shaadi</i> Agency.</p>

<p>The Lovely Girls lined up on the left side of the Silken Wall that ran the length of the bungalow garden. The first twelve men formed up on the right. They plumped and preened in their finery but I could see they were nervous. The partition was no more than a row of saris pinned to a line strung between plastic uprights, fluttering in the rising evening wind. A token of decorum. Purdah. They were not even silk.</p>

<p>Reshmi was first to walk and talk the Silken Wall. She was a Yadav country girl from Uttaranchal, big-handed and big-faced. A peasant&rsquo;s daughter. She could cook and sew and sing, do household accounts, manage both domestic aeais and human staff. Her first prospective was a weasely man with a weak jaw in government whites and a Nehru cap. He had bad teeth. Never good. Any one of us could have told him he was wasting his <i>shaadi</i> fee, but they <i>namasted</i> to each other and stepped out, regulation three paces between them. At the end of the walk Reshmi would loop back to rejoin the tail of the line and meet her next prospective. On big <i>shaadis</i> like this my feet would bleed by the end of the night. Red footprints on the marble floors of Mamaji&rsquo;s courtyard <i>haveli</i>.</p>

<p>I stepped out with Ashok, a big globe of a thirty-two-year-old who wheezed a little as he rolled along. He was dressed in a voluminous white <i>kurta</i>, the fashion this season though he was fourth generation Punjabi. His grooming amounted to an uncontrollable beard and oily hair that smelled of too much Dapper Deepak pomade. Even before he <i>namaste</i>d I knew it was his first <i>shaadi</i>. I could see his eyeballs move as he read my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, seeming to hover before him. I did not need to read his to know he was a dataraja, for he talked about nothing but himself and the brilliant things he was doing; the spec of some new protein processor array, the &rsquo;ware he was breeding, the aeais he was nurturing in his stables, his trips to Europe and the United States where everyone knew his name and great people were glad to welcome him.</p>

<p><q>Of course, Awadh&rsquo;s never going to ratify the Hamilton Acts&mdash;no matter how close Shrivastava Minister is to President McAuley&mdash;but if it did, if we allow ourselves that tiny counterfactual&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s the end of the economy: Awadh <i>is</i> IT, there are more graduates in Mehrauli than there are in the whole of California. The Americans may go on about the mockery of a human soul, but they <i>need</i> our Level 2.8s&mdash;you know what that is? An aeai can pass as human 99 percent of the time&mdash;because everybody know no one does quantum crypto like us, so I&rsquo;m not worrying about having to close up the data-haven, and even if they do, well, there&rsquo;s always Bharat&mdash;I cannot see the Ranas bowing down to Washington, not when 25 percent of their forex comes out of licensing deals from <i>Town and Country &hellip;</i>and that&rsquo;s hundred percent aeai generated&hellip;.</q></p>

<p>He was a big affable clown of a man with wealth that would have bought my Palace in Durbar Square and every priest in it and I found myself praying to Taleju to save me from marrying such a bore. He stopped in mid-stride, so abruptly I almost tripped.</p>

<p><q>You must keep walking,</q> I hissed. <q>That is the rule.</q></p>

<p><q>Wow,</q> he said, standing stupid, eyes round in surprise. Couples piled up behind us. In my peripheral vision I could see Mamaji making urgent, threatening gestures. Get him <i>on</i>. <q>Oh wow. You&rsquo;re an ex-Kumari.</q></p>

<p><q>Please, you are drawing attention to yourself.</q> I would have tugged his arm, but that would have been an even more deadly error.</p>

<p><q>What was it like, being a goddess?</q></p>

<p><q>I am just a woman now, like any other,</q> I said. Ashok gave a soft harrumph, as if he had achieved a very small enlightenment, and walked on, hands clasped behind his back. He may have spoken to me once, twice before we reached the end of the Silk Wall and parted: I did not hear him, I did not hear the music, I did not even hear the eternal thunder of Delhi&rsquo;s traffic. The only sound in my head was the high-pitched sound between my eyes of needing to cry but knowing I could not. Fat, selfish, gabbling, Ashok had sent me back to the night I ceased to be a goddess.</p>

<p>Bare soles slapping the polished wood of the Kumari Ghar&rsquo;s corridors. Running feet, muted shouts growing ever more distant as I knelt, still unclothed for my Kumarima&rsquo;s inspection, looking at the blood drip from my smashed fingertip onto the painted wood floor. I remember no pain; rather, I looked at the pain from a separate place, as if the girl who felt it were another person. Far far away, Smiling Kumarima stood, held in time, hands to mouth in horror and guilt. The voices faded and the bells of Durbar Square began to swing and toll, calling to their brothers across the city of Kathmandu until the valley rang from Bhaktapur to Trisuli Bazaar for the fall of the Kumari <i>Devi</i>.</p>

<p>In the space of a single night, I became human again. I was taken to the Hanumandhoka&mdash;walking this time like anyone else on the paving stones&mdash;where the priests said a final <i>puja</i>. I handed back my red robes and jewels and boxes of make-up, all neatly folded and piled. Tall Kumarima had got me human clothes. I think she had been keeping them for some time. The King did not come to say goodbye to me. I was no longer his sister. But his surgeons had put my finger back together well, though they warned that it would always feel a little numb and inflexible.</p>

<p>I left at dawn, while the street cleaners were washing down the stones of Durbar Square beneath the apricot sky, in a smooth-running Royal Mercedes with darkened windows. My Kumarimas made their farewells at the palace gate. Tall Kumarima hugged me briefly to her.</p>

<p><q>Oh, there was so much more I needed to do. Well, it will have to suffice.</q></p>

<p>I felt her quivering against me, like a bird too tightly gripped in a hand. Smiling Kumarima could not look at me. I did not want her to.</p>

<p>As the car took me across the waking city I tried to understand how it felt to be human. I had been a goddess so long I could hardly remember feeling any other way, but it seemed so little different that I began to suspect that you are divine because people say you are. The road climbed through green suburbs, winding now, growing narrower, busy with brightly decorated buses and trucks. The houses grew leaner and meaner, to roadside hovels and <i>chai</i>-stalls and then we were out of the city&mdash;the first time since I had arrived seven years before. I pressed my hands and face to the glass and looked down on Kathmandu beneath its shroud of ochre smog. The car joined the long line of traffic along the narrow, rough road that clung to the valley side. Above me, mountains dotted with goatherd shelters and stone shrines flying tattered prayer banners. Below me, rushing cream-brown water. Nearly there. I wondered how far behind me on this road were those other government cars, carrying the priests sent to seek out little girls bearing the thirty-two signs of perfection. Then the car rounded the bend in the valley and I was home, Shakya, its truck halts and gas station, the shops and the temple of Padma Narteswara, the dusty trees with white rings painted around their trunks and between them the stone wall and arch where the steps led down through the terraces to my house, and in that stone-framed rectangle of sky, my parents, standing there side by side, pressing closely, shyly, against each other as I had last seen them lingering in the courtyard of the Kumari Ghar.</p>

<br/>

<p>Mamaji was too respectable to show anything like outright anger, but she had ways of expressing her displeasure. The smallest crust of <i>roti</i> at dinner, the meanest scoop of <i>dhal</i>. New girls coming, make room make room&mdash;me to the highest, stuffiest room, furthest from the cool of the courtyard pool.</p>

<p><q>He asked for my palmer address,</q> I said.</p>

<p><q>If I had a rupee for every palmer address,</q> Mamaji said. <q>He was only interested in you as a novelty, dearie. Anthropology. He was never going to make a proposition. No, you can forget right about him.</q></p>

<p>But my banishment to the tower was a small punishment for it lifted me above the noise and fumes of the old city. If portions were cut, small loss: the food had been dreadful every day of the almost two years I had been at the <i>haveli</i>. Through the wooden lattice, beyond the water tanks and satellite dishes and kids playing rooftop cricket, I could see the ramparts of the Red Fort, the minarets and domes of the Jami Masjid and beyond them, the glittering glass and titanium spires of New Delhi. And higher than any of them, the flocks of pigeons from the <i>kabooter</i> lofts, clay pipes bound to their legs so they fluted and sang as they swirled over Chandni Chowk. And Mamaji&rsquo;s worldly wisdom made her a fool this time, for Ashok was surreptitiously messaging me, sometimes questions about when I was divine, mostly about himself and his great plans and ideas. His lilac-colored words, floating in my inner-vision against the intricate silhouettes of my <i>jali</i> screens, were bright pleasures in those high summer days. I discovered the delight of political argument; against Ashok&rsquo;s breezy optimism, I set my readings of the news channels. From the opinion columns it seemed inevitable to me that Awadh, in exchange for Favored Nation status from the United States of America, would ratify the Hamilton Acts and outlaw all aeais more intelligent than a langur monkey. I told none of our intercourse to Mamaji. She would have forbidden it, unless he made a proposal.</p>

<p>On an evening of pre-monsoon heat, when the boys were too tired even for cricket and the sky was an upturned brass bowl, Mamaji came to my turret on the top of the old merchant&rsquo;s <i>haveli</i>. Against propriety, the <i>jali</i>s were thrown open, my gauze curtains stirred in the swirls of heat rising from the alleys below.</p>

<p><q>Still you are eating my bread.</q> She prodded my <i>thali</i> with her foot. It was too hot for food, too hot for anything other than lying and waiting for the rain and the cool, if it came at all this year. I could hear the voices of the girls down in the courtyard as they kicked their legs in the pool. This day I would have loved to be sitting along the tiled edge with them but I was piercingly aware that I had lived in the <i>haveli</i> of the Lovely Girl <i>Shaadi</i> Agency longer than any of them. I did not want to be their Kumarima. And when the whispers along the cool marble corridors made them aware of my childhood, they would ask for small <i>pujas</i>, little miracles to help them find the right man. I no longer granted them, not because I feared that I had no power any more&mdash;that I never had&mdash;but that it went out from me and into them and that was why they got the bankers and television executives and Mercedes salesmen.</p>

<p><q>I should have left you in that Nepalese sewer. Goddess! Hah! And me fooled into thinking you were a prize asset. Men! They may have share options and Chowpatty Beach apartments but deep down, they&rsquo;re as superstitious as any back-country <i>yadav.</i></q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m sorry, Mamaji,</q> I said, turning my eyes away.</p>

<p><q>Can you help it? You were only born perfect in thirty-two different ways. Now you listen, <i>cho chweet</i>. A man came to call on me.</q></p>

<p>Men always came calling, glancing up at the giggles and rustles of the Lovely Girls peeping through the <i>jali</i>s as he waited in the cool of the courtyard for Shweta to present him to Mamaji. Men with offers of marriage, men with prenuptial contracts, men with dowry down-payments. Men asking for special, private viewings. This man who had called on Mamaji had come for one of these.</p>

<p><q>Fine young man, lovely young man, just twenty. Father&rsquo;s big in water. He has requested a private rendezvous, with you.</q></p>

<p>I was instantly suspicious, but I had learned among the Lovely Girls of Delhi, even more than among the priests and Kumarimas of Kathmandu, to let nothing show on my painted face.</p>

<p><q>Me? Such an honor &hellip; and him only twenty &hellip; and a good family too, so well connected.</q></p>

<p><q>He is a Brahmin.</q></p>

<p><q>I know I am only a Shakya&hellip;.</q></p>

<p><q>You don&rsquo;t understand. He is a <i>Brahmin</i>.</q></p>

<p><i>There was so much more I needed to do</i>, Tall Kumarima had said as the royal car drove away from the carved wooden gates of the Kumari Ghar. One whisper through the window would have told me everything: <i>the curse of the Kumari</i>.</p>

<p>Shakya hid from me. People crossed the street to find things to look at and do. Old family friends nodded nervously before remembering important business they had to be about. The <i>chai-dhabas</i> gave me free tea so I would feel uncomfortable and leave. Truckers were my friends, bus-drivers and long-haulers pulled in at the biodiesel stations. They must have wondered who was this strange twelve-year-old girl, hanging around truck-halts. I do not doubt some of them thought more. Village by village, town by town the legend spread up and down the north road. Ex-Kumari.</p>

<p>Then the accidents started. A boy lost half his hand in the fan belt of a Nissan engine. A teenager drank bad <i>rakshi</i> and died of alcohol poisoning. A man slipped between two passing trucks and was crushed. The talk in the <i>chai-dhabas</i> and the repair shops was once again of my uncle who fell to his death while the little goddess-to-be bounced in her wire cradle laughing and laughing and laughing.</p>

<p>I stopped going out. As winter took hold over the head-country of the Kathmandu valley, whole weeks passed when I did not leave my room. Days slipped away watching sleet slash past my window, the prayer banners bent almost horizontal in the wind, the wire of the cableway bouncing. Beneath it, the furious, flooding river. In that season the voices of the demons spoke loud from the mountain, telling me the most hateful things about faithless Kumaris who betray the sacred heritage of their <i>devi</i>.</p>

<p>On the shortest day of the year the bride buyer came through Shakya. I heard a voice I did not recognize talking over the television that burbled away day and night in the main room. I opened the door just enough to admit a voice and gleam of firelight.</p>

<p><q>I wouldn&rsquo;t take the money off you. You&rsquo;re wasting your time here in Nepal. Everyone knows the story, and even if they pretend they don&rsquo;t believe, they don&rsquo;t act that way.</q></p>

<p>I heard my father&rsquo;s voice but could not make out his words. The bride buyer said,</p>

<p><q>What might work is down south, Bharat or Awadh. They&rsquo;re so desperate in Delhi they&rsquo;ll even take Untouchables. They&rsquo;re a queer lot, those Indians; some of them might even like the idea of marrying a goddess, like a status thing. But I can&rsquo;t take her, she&rsquo;s too young, they&rsquo;ll send her straight back at the border. They&rsquo;ve got rules. In India, would you believe? Call me when she turns fourteen.</q></p>

<p>Two days after my fourteenth birthday, the bride buyer returned to Shakya and I left with him in his Japanese SUV. I did not like his company or trust his hands, so I slept or feigned sleep while he drove down into the lowlands of the Terai. When I woke I was well over the border into my childhood land of wonder. I had thought the bride-buyer would take me to ancient, holy Varanasi, the new capital of the Bharat&rsquo;s dazzling Rana dynasty, but the Awadhis, it seemed, were less in awe of Hindu superstitions. So we came to the vast, incoherent roaring sprawl of the two Delhis, like twin hemispheres of a brain, and to the Lovely Girl <i>Shaadi</i> Agency. Where the marriageable men were not so twenty-forties sophisticated, at least in the matter of ex-<i>devis</i>. Where the only ones above the curse of the Kumari were those held in even greater superstitious awe: the genetically engineered children known as Brahmins.</p>

<p>Wisdom was theirs, health was theirs, beauty and success and status assured and a wealth that could never be devalued or wasted or gambled away, for it was worked into every twist of their DNA. The Brahmin children of India&rsquo;s super-elite enjoyed long life&mdash;twice that of their parents&mdash;but at a price. They were indeed the twice-born, a caste above any other, so high as to be new Untouchables. A fitting partner for a former goddess: a new god.</p>

<br/>

<p>Gas flares from the heavy industries of Tughluq lit the western horizon. From the top of the high tower I could read New Delhi&rsquo;s hidden geometries, the necklaces of light around Connaught Place, the grand glowing net of the dead Raj&rsquo;s monumental capital, the incoherent glow of the old city to the north. The penthouse at the top of the sweeping wing-curve of Narayan Tower was glass; glass walls, glass roof, beneath me, polished obsidian that reflected the night sky. I walked with stars at my head and feet. It was a room designed to awe and intimidate. It was nothing to one who had witnessed demons strike the heads from goats, who had walked on bloody silk to her own palace. It was nothing to one dressed, as the messenger had required, in the full panoply of the goddess. Red robe, red nails, red lips, red eye of Siva painted above my own black kohled eyes, fake-gold headdress hung with costume pearls, my fingers dripped gaudy rings from the cheap jewelry sellers of Kinari Bazaar, a light chain of real gold ran from my nose stud to my ear-ring; I was once again Kumari <i>Devi</i>. My demons rustled inside me.</p>

<p>Mamaji had drilled me as we scooted from old city to new. She had swathed me in a light voile <i>chador</i>, to protect my make-up she said; in truth, to conceal me from the eyes of the street. The girls had called blessings and prayers after me as the <i>phatphat</i> scuttled out of the <i>haveli</i>&rsquo;s courtyard.</p>

<p><q>You will say nothing. If he speaks to you, you duck your head like a good Hindu girl. If anything has to be said, I will say it. You may have been a goddess but he is a Brahmin. He could buy your pissy palace a dozen times over. Above all, do not let your eyes betray you. The eyes say nothing. They taught you that at least in that Kathmandu, didn&rsquo;t they? Now come on <i>cho chweet</i>, let&rsquo;s make a match.</q></p>

<p>The glass penthouse was lit only by city-glow and concealed lamps that gave off an uncomfortable blue light. Ved Prakash Narayan sat on a <i>musnud</i>, a slab of unadorned black marble. Its simplicity spoke of wealth and power beneath any ornate jewelry. My bare feet whispered on the star-filled glass. Blue light welled up as I approached the dais. Ved Prakash Narayan was dressed in a beautifully worked long <i>sherwani</i> coat and traditional tight <i>churidar</i> pajamas. He leaned forward into the light and it took every word of control Tall Kumarima had ever whispered to me to hold the gasp.</p>

<p>A ten-year-old boy sat on the throne of the Mughal Emperor.</p>

<p>Live twice as long, but age half as fast. The best deal Kolkata&rsquo;s genetic engineers could strike with four million years of human DNA. A child husband for a once-child goddess. Except this was no child. In legal standing, experience, education, taste, and emotions, this was a twenty-year-old man, every way except the physical.</p>

<p>His feet did not touch the floor.</p>

<p><q>Quite, quite extraordinary.</q> His voice was a boy&rsquo;s. He slipped from his throne, walked around me, studying me as if I were an artifact in a museum. He was a head shorter than me. <q>Yes, this is indeed special. What is the settlement?</q></p>

<p>Mamaji&rsquo;s voice from the door named a number. I obeyed my training and tried not to catch his eye as he stalked around me.</p>

<p><q>Acceptable. My man will deliver the prenuptial before the end of the week. A goddess. My goddess.</q></p>

<p>Then I caught his eyes and I saw where all his missing years were. They were blue, alien blue, and colder than any of the lights of his tower-top palace.</p>

<br/>

<p><i>These Brahmins are worse than any of us when it comes to social climbing</i>, Ashok messaged me in my aerie atop the <i>shaadi haveli</i>, prison turned bridal boudoir. <i>Castes within castes within castes.</i> His words hung in the air over the hazy ramparts of the red fort before dissolving into the dashings of the musical pigeons. <i>Your children will be blessed.</i></p>

<p>Until then I had not thought about the duties of a wife with a ten-year-old boy.</p>

<p>On a day of staggering heat I was wed to Ved Prakash Narayan in a climate-control bubble on the manicured green before Emperor Humayun&rsquo;s tomb. As on the night I was introduced, I was dressed as Kumari. My husband, veiled in gold, arrived perched on top of a white horse followed by a band and a dozen elephants with colored patterns worked on their trunks. Security robots patrolled the grounds as astrologers proclaimed favorable auspices and an old-type brahmin in his red cord blessed our union. Rose petals fluttered around me, the proud father and mother distributed gems from Hyderabad to their guests, my <i>shaadi</i> sisters wept with joy and loss, Mamaji sniffed back a tear and vile old Shweta went round hoarding the free and over-flowing food from the buffet. As we were applauded and played down the receiving line, I noticed all the other somber-faced ten-year-old boys with their beautiful, tall foreign wives. I reminded myself who was the child bride here. But none of them were goddesses.</p>

<p>I remember little of the grand <i>durbar</i> that followed except face after face after face, mouth after mouth after mouth opening, making noise, swallowing glass after glass after glass of French champagne. I did not drink for I do not have the taste for alcohol, though my young husband in his raja finery took it, and smoked big cigars too. As we got into the car&mdash;the <i>honeymoon</i> was another Western tradition we were adopting&mdash;I asked if anyone had remembered to inform my parents.</p>

<p>We flew to Mumbai on the company tilt-jet. I had never before flown in an aircraft. I pressed my hands, still hennaed with the patterns of my <i>mehndi</i>, on either side of the window as if to hold in every fleeting glimpse of Delhi falling away beneath me. It was every divine vision I had ever had looking down from my bed in the Kumari Ghar on to India. This was indeed the true vehicle of a goddess. But the demons whispered as we turned in the air over the towers of New Delhi, <i>you will be old and withered when he is still in his prime.</i></p>

<p>When the limousine from the airport turned on to Marine Drive and I saw the Arabian Sea glinting in the city-light, I asked my husband to stop the car so I could look and wonder. I felt tears start in my eyes and thought, <i>the same water in it is in you</i>. But the demons would not let me be: <i>you are married to something that is not human</i>.</p>

<p>My <i>honeymoon</i> was wonder upon wonder: our penthouse apartment with the glass walls that opened on sunset over Chowpatty Beach. The new splendid outfits we wore as we drove along the boulevards, where stars and movie-gods smiled down and blessed us in the virtual sight of our palmers. Color, motion, noise, chatter; people and people and people. Behind it all, the wash and hush and smell of the alien sea.</p>

<p>Chambermaids prepared me for the wedding night. They worked with baths and balms, oils and massages, extending the now-fading henna tracery on my hands up my arms, over my small upright breasts, down the <i>manipuraka chakra</i> over my navel. They wove gold ornaments into my hair, slipped bracelets on my arms and rings on my fingers and toes, dusted and powdered my dark Nepali skin. They purified me with incense smoke and flower petals, they shrouded me in veils and silks as fine as rumors. They lengthened my lashes and kohled my eyes and shaped my nails to fine, painted points.</p>

<p><q>What do I do? I&rsquo;ve never even touched a man,</q> I asked, but they <i>namasted</i> and slipped away without answer. But the older&mdash;the Tall Kumarima, as I thought of her&mdash;left a small soapstone box on my bridal divan. Inside were two white pills.</p>

<p>They were good. I should have expected no less. One moment I was standing nervous and fearful on the Turkestan carpet with a soft night air that smelled of the sea stirring the translucent curtains, the next visions of the Kama Sutra, beamed into my brain through my golden earhook, swirled up around me like the pigeons over Chandni Chowk. I looked at the patterns my <i>shaadi</i> sisters had painted on the palms of my hands and they danced and coiled from my skin. The smells and perfumes of my body were alive, suffocating. It was as if my skin had been peeled back and every nerve exposed. Even the touch of the barely moving night air was intolerable. Every car horn on Marine Drive was like molten silver dropped into my ear.</p>

<p>I was terribly afraid.</p>

<p>Then the double doors to the robing room opened and my husband entered. He was dressed as a Mughal grandee in a jeweled turban and a long-sleeved pleated red robe bowed out at the front in the manly act.</p>

<p><q>My goddess,</q> he said. Then he parted his robe and I saw what stood so proud.</p>

<p>The harness was of crimson leather intricately inlaid with fine mirror-work. It fastened around the waist and also over the shoulders, for extra security. The buckles were gold. I recall the details of the harness so clearly because I could not take more than one look at the thing it carried. Black. Massive as a horse&rsquo;s, but delicately upcurved. Ridged and studded. This all I remember before the room unfolded around me like the scented petals of a lotus and my senses blended as one and I was running through the apartments of the Taj Marine Hotel.</p>

<p>How had I ever imagined it could be different for a creature with the appetites and desires of an adult but the physical form of a ten-year-old boy?</p>

<p>Servants and dressers stared at me as I screamed incoherently, grabbing at wraps, shawls, anything to cover my shame. At some tremendous remove I remember my husband&rsquo;s voice calling <i>Goddess! My Goddess!</i> over and over.</p>

<br/>

<p><q>Schizophrenia is a terribly grating word,</q> Ashok said. He twirled the stem of a red thornless rose between his fingers. <q>Old-school. It&rsquo;s dissociative disorder these days. Except there are no disorders, just adaptive behaviors. It was what you needed to cope with being a goddess. Dissociating. Disjuncting. Becoming you and <i>other</i> to stay sane.</q></p>

<p>Night in the gardens of the Dataraja Ashok. Water trickled in the stone canals of the <i>charbagh</i>. I could smell it, sweet and wet. A pressure curtain held the smog at bay; trees screened out Delhi&rsquo;s traffic. I could even see a few stars. We sat in an open <i>chhatri</i> pavilion, the marble still warm from the day. Set on silver <i>thalis</i> were medjool dates, <i>halva</i>&mdash;crisp with flies&mdash;folded <i>paan</i>. A security robot stepped into the lights from the Colonial bungalow, passed into shadow. But for it I might have been in the age of the rajas.</p>

<p>Time broken apart, whirring like <i>kabooter</i> wings. Dissociative behavior. Mechanisms for coping. Running along the palm-lined boulevards of Mumbai, shawls clutched around my wifely finery that made me feel more naked than bare skin. I ran without heed or direction. Taxis hooted, <i>phatphats</i> veered as I dashed across crowded streets. Even if I had had money for a <i>phatphat&mdash;</i>what need had the wife of a Brahmin for crude cash?&mdash;I did not know where to direct it. Yet that other, demonic self must have known, for I found myself on the vast marble concourse of a railway station, a sole mite of stillness among the tens of thousands of hastening travelers and beggars and vendors and staff. My shawls and throws clutched around me, I looked up at the dome of red Raj stone and it was a second skull, full of the awful realization of what I had done.</p>

<p>A runaway bride without even a <i>paisa</i> to her name, alone in Mumbai Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. A hundred trains leaving that minute for any destination but nowhere to go. People stared at me, half Nautch-courtesan, half Untouchable street-sleeper. In my shame, I remembered the hook behind my ear. <i>Ashok</i>, I wrote across the sandstone pillars and swirling ads. <i>Help me!</i></p>

<p><q>I don&rsquo;t want to be split, I don&rsquo;t want to be me and <i>other</i>, why can&rsquo;t I just be one?</q> I beat the heels of my hands off my forehead in frustration. <q>Make me well, make me right!</q> Shards of memory. The white-uniformed staff serving me hot <i>chai</i> in the first-class private compartment of the <i>shatabdi</i> express. The robots waiting at the platform with the antique covered palanquin, to bear me through the Delhi dawn traffic to the green watered geometries of Ashok&rsquo;s gardens. But behind them all was one enduring image, my uncle&rsquo;s white fist slipping on the bouncing cable and him falling, legs pedalling air, to the creamy waters of Shakya river. Even then, I had been split. Fear and shock. Laughter and smiles. How else could anyone survive being a goddess?</p>

<p><i>Goddess. My Goddess.</i></p>

<p>Ashok could not understand. <q>Would you cure a singer of his talent? There is no madness, only ways of adapting. Intelligence is evolution. Some would argue that I display symptoms of mild Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome.</q></p>

<p><q>I don&rsquo;t know what that means.</q></p>

<p>He twirled the rose so hard the stem snapped.</p>

<p><q>Have you thought about what you&rsquo;re going to do?</q></p>

<p>I had thought of little else. The Narayans would not give up their dowry lightly. Mamaji would sweep me from her door. My village was closed to me.</p>

<p><q>Maybe for a while, if you could &hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s not a good time&hellip;. Who&rsquo;s going to have the ear of the Lok Sabha? A family building a dam that&rsquo;s going to guarantee their water supply for the next fifty years, or a software entrepreneur with a stable of Level 2.75 aeais that the United States government thinks are the sperm of Shaitan? Family values still count in Awadh. You should know.</q></p>

<p>I heard my voice say, like a very small girl, <q>Where can I go?</q></p>

<p>The bride-buyer&rsquo;s stories of Kumaris whom no one would marry and could not go home again ended in the woman-cages of Varanasi and Kolkata. Chinese paid rupees by the roll for an ex-Goddess.</p>

<p>Ashok moistened his lips with his tongue.</p>

<p><q>I have someone in Bharat, in Varanasi. Awadh and Bharat are seldom on speaking terms.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh thank you, thank you &hellip;</q> I went down on my knees before Ashok, clutched his hands between my palms. He looked away. Despite the artificial cool of the <i>charbagh</i>, he was sweating freely.</p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s not a gift. It&rsquo;s &hellip; employment. A job.</q></p>

<p><q>A job, that&rsquo;s good, I can do that; I&rsquo;m a good worker, work away at anything I will; what is it? Doesn&rsquo;t matter, I can do it&hellip;.</q></p>

<p><q>There are commodities need transported.</q></p>

<p><q>What kind of commodities? Oh it doesn&rsquo;t mater, I can carry anything.</q></p>

<p><q>Aeais.</q> He rolled a <i>paan</i> from the silver dish. <q>I&rsquo;m not going to wait around for Shrivastava&rsquo;s Krishna Cops to land in my garden with their excommunication ware.</q></p>

<p><q>The Hamilton Acts,</q> I ventured, though I did not know what they were, what most of Ashok&rsquo;s mumbles and rants meant.</p>

<p><q>Word is, everything above level 2.5.</q> Ashok chewed his lower lip. His eyes widened as the <i>paan</i> curled through his skull.</p>

<p><q>Of course, I will do anything I can to help.</q></p>

<p><q>I haven&rsquo;t told you how I need you to transport them. Absolutely safe, secure, where no Krishna Cop can ever find them.</q> He touched his right forefinger to his Third Eye. <q>Self, and <i>other</i>.</q></p>

<br/>

<p>I went to Kerala and had processors put into my skull. Two men did it on a converted bulk gas carrier moored outside territorial waters. They shaved my long lovely black hair, unhinged my skull and sent robots smaller than the tiniest spider spinning computers through my brain. Their position out beyond the Keralese fast patrol boats enabled them to carry out much secret surgery, mostly for the Western military. They gave me a bungalow and an Australian girl to watch over me while my sutures fused and hormone washes speed-grew my hair back.</p>

<p><i>Protein chips; only show on the highest resolution scans but no one&rsquo;ll look twice at you; no one&rsquo;ll look twice at another <i>shaadi</i> girl down hunting for a husband.</i></p>

<p>So I sat and stared at the sea for six weeks and thought about what it would be like to drown in the middle of it, alone and lost a thousand kilometers from the nearest hand that might seize yours. A thousand kilometers north in Delhi a man in an Indian suit shook hands with a man in an American suit and announced the Special Relationship that would make Ashok an outlaw.</p>

<p><i>You know what Krishna Cops are? They hunt aeais. They hunt the people who stable them, and the people who carry them. They don&rsquo;t care. They&rsquo;re not picky. But they won&rsquo;t catch you. They&rsquo;ll never catch you.</i></p>

<p>I listened to demons in the swash and run of the big sea on the shore. Demons I now knew were facets of my other self. But I was not afraid of them. In Hinduism, demons are merely the mirrors of the gods. As with men, so with gods; it is the winners who write the history. The universe would look no different had Ravana and his Rakshasas won their cosmic wars.</p>

<p><i>No one but you can carry them. No one but you has the neurological architecture. No one but you could endure another mind in there.</i></p>

<p>The Australian girl left small gifts outside my door: plastic bangles, jelly-shoes, rings, and hairslides. She stole them from the shops in town. I think they were her way of saying that she wanted to know me, but was afraid of what I had been, of what the things in my head would make me become. The last thing she stole was a beautiful sheer silk <i>dupatta</i> to cover my ragged hair when she took me to the airport. From beneath it I looked at the girls in business saris talking into their hands in the departure lounge and listened to the woman pilot announce the weather in Awadh. Then I looked out of the <i>phatphat</i> at the girls darting confidently through the Delhi traffic on their scooters and wondered why my life could not be like theirs.</p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s grown back well.</q> Ashok knelt before me on my cushions in the <i>chhatri</i>. It was his sacred place, his temple. He raised his palmer-gloved hand and touched his forefinger to the <i>tilak</i> over my third eye. I could smell his breath. Onions, garlic, rancid <i>ghee</i>. <q>You may feel a little disoriented&hellip;.</q></p>

<p>I gasped. Senses blurred, fused, melted. I saw heard felt smelled tasted everything as one undifferentiated sensation, as gods and babies sense, wholly and purely. Sounds were colored, light had texture, smells spoke and chimed. Then I saw myself surge up from my cushions and fall toward the hard white marble. I heard myself cry out. Ashok lunged toward me. Two Ashoks lunged toward me. But it was neither of those. I saw one Ashok, with two visions, inside my head. I could not make shape or sense out of my two seeings, I could not tell which was real, which was mine, which was <i>me</i>. Universes away I heard a voice say <i>help me</i>. I saw Ashok&rsquo;s houseboys lift me and take me to bed. The painted ceiling, patterned with vines and shoots and flowers, billowed above me like monsoon storm clouds, then blossomed into darkness.</p>

<p>In the heat of the night I woke stark, staring, every sense glowing. I knew the position and velocity of each insect in my airy room that smelled of biodiesel, dust, and patchouli. I was not alone. There was an <i>other</i> under the dome of my skull. Not an awareness, a consciousness; a sense of <i>separateness</i>, a manifestation of myself. An avatar. A demon.</p>

<p><q>Who are you?</q> I whispered. My voice sounded loud and full of bells, like Durbar Square. It did not answer&mdash;it could not answer, it was not a sentience&mdash;but it took me out into the <i>charbagh</i> water garden. The stars, smudged by pollution, were a dome over me. The crescent moon lay on its back. I looked up and fell into it. <i>Chandra. Mangal. Budh. Guru. Shukra. Shani. Rahu. Ketu</i>. The planets were not points of light, balls of stone and gas; they had names, characters, loves, hatreds. The twenty-seven <i>Nakshatars</i> spun around my head. I saw their shapes and natures, the patterns of connections that bound the stars into relationships and stories and dramas as human and complex as <i>Town and Country</i>. I saw the wheel of the <i>rashis</i>, the Great Houses, arc across the sky, and the whole turning, engines within engines, endless wheels of influence and subtle communication, from the edge of the universe to the center of the earth I stood upon. Planets, stars, constellations; the story of every human life unfolded itself above me and I could read them all. Every word.</p>

<p>All night I played among the stars.</p>

<p>In the morning, over bed-tea, I asked Ashok, <q>What is it?</q></p>

<p><q>A rudimentary Level 2.6. A <i>janampatri</i> aeai, does astrology, runs the permutations. It thinks it lives out there, like some kind of space monkey. It&rsquo;s not very smart, really. Knows about horoscopes and that&rsquo;s it. Now get that down you and grab your stuff. You&rsquo;ve a train to catch.</q></p>

<p>My reserved seat was in the women&rsquo;s <i>bogie</i> of the high-speed <i>shatabdi</i> express. Husbands booked their wives on to it to protect them from the attentions of the male passengers who assumed every female was single and available. The few career women chose it for the same reason. My fellow passenger across the table from me was a Muslim woman in a formal business <i>shalwar</i>. She regarded me with disdain as we raced across the Ganga plain at three hundred and fifty kilometers per hour. <i>Little simpering wife-thing.</i></p>

<p><i>You would not be so quick to judge if you knew what we really were</i>, I thought. <i>We can look into your life and tell you everything that has, is and will ever happen to you, mapped out in the <i>chakras</i> of the stars.</i> In that night among the constellations my demon and I had flowed into each other until there was no place where we could say aeai ended and I began.</p>

<p>I had thought holy Varanasi would sing to me like Kathmandu, a spiritual home, a city of nine million gods and one goddess, riding through the streets in a <i>phatphat</i>. What I saw was another Indian capital of another Indian state; glass towers and diamond domes and industry parks for the big world to notice, slums and <i>bastis</i> at their feet like sewage pigs. Streets began in this millennium and ended in one three before it. Traffic and hoardings and people people people but the diesel smoke leaking in around the edges of my smog mask carried a ghost of incense.</p>

<p>Ashok&rsquo;s Varanasi agent met me in the Jantar Mantar, the great solar observatory of Jai Singh; sundials and star spheres and shadow discs like modern sculpture. She was little older than me; dressed in a cling-silk top and jeans that hung so low from her hips I could see the valley of her buttocks. I disliked her at once but she touched her palmer-glove to my forehead in the shadows around Jai Singh&rsquo;s astrological instruments and I felt the stars go out of me. The sky died. I had been holy again and now I was just meat. Ashok&rsquo;s <i>girli</i> pressed a roll of rupees into my hand. I barely looked at it. I barely heard her instructions to get something to eat, get a <i>kafi</i>, get some decent clothes. I was bereft. I found myself trudging up the steep stone steps of the great Samrat not knowing where I was who I was what I was doing halfway up a massive sundial. Half a me. Then my third eye opened and I saw the river wide and blue before me. I saw the white sands of the eastern shore and the shelters and dung fires of the <i>sadhus</i>. I saw the <i>ghats</i>, the stone river steps, curving away on either side further than the reach of my eyes. And I saw people. People washing and praying cleaning their clothes and offering <i>puja</i> and buying and selling and living and dying. People in boats and people kneeling, people waist deep in the river, people scooping up silver handfuls of water to pour over their heads. People casting handfuls of marigold flowers onto the stream, people lighting little mango-leaf <i>diya</i> lamps and setting them afloat, people bringing their dead to dip them in the sacred water. I saw the pyres of the burning <i>ghat</i>, I smelled sandalwood, charring flesh, I heard the skull burst, releasing the soul. I had heard that sound before at the Royal burning <i>ghats</i> of Pashupatinath, when the King&rsquo;s Mother died. A soft crack, and free. It was a comforting sound. It made me think of home.</p>

<br/>

<p>In that season I came many times to the city by the Ganga. Each time I was a different person. Accountants, counselors, machine-soldiers, <i>soapi</i> actors, database controllers: I was the goddess of a thousand skills. The day after I saw Awadhi Krishna Cops patrolling the platforms at Delhi station with their security robots and guns that could kill both humans and aeais, Ashok began to mix up my modes of transport. I flew, I trained, I chugged overnight on overcrowded country buses, I waited in chauffeured Mercedes in long lines of brightly decorated trucks at the Awadh-Bharat border. The trucks, like the crack of an exploding skull, reminded me of my kingdom. But at the end was always the rat-faced <i>girli</i> lifting her hand to my <i>tilak</i> and taking me apart again. In that season I was a fabric weaver, a tax consultant, a wedding planner, a <i>soapi</i> editor, an air traffic controller. She took all of them away.</p>

<p>And then the trip came when the Krishna Cops were waiting at the Bharat end as well. By now I knew the politics of it as well as Ashok. The Bharatis would never sign the Hamilton Acts&mdash;their multi-billion-rupee entertainment industry depended on aeais&mdash;but neither did they want to antagonize America. So, a compromise: all aeais over Level 2.8 banned, everything else licensed and Krishna Cops patrolling the airports and railway stations. Like trying to hold back the Ganga with your fingers.</p>

<p>I had spotted the courier on the flight. He was two rows in front of me; young, wisp of a beard, Star-Asia youth fashion, all baggy and big. Nervous nervous nervous, all the time checking his breast pocket, checking checking checking. A small time <i>badmash</i>, a wannabe dataraja with a couple of specialist 2.85s loaded onto a palmer. I could not imagine how he had made it through Delhi airport security.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that the Varanasi Krishna Cops would spot him. They closed on him as we lined up at passport control. He broke. He ran. Women and children fled as he ran across the huge marble arrivals hall, trying to get to the light, the huge glass wall and the doors and the mad traffic beyond. His fists pounded at air. I heard the Krishna Cops&rsquo; staccato cries. I saw them unholster their weapons. Shrieks went up. I kept my head down, shuffled forward. The immigration officer checked my papers. Another <i>shaadi</i> bride on the hunt. I hurried through, turned away toward the taxi ranks. Behind me I heard the arrivals hall fall so shockingly silent it seemed to ring like a temple bell.</p>

<p>I was afraid then. When I returned to Delhi it was as if my fear had flown before me. The city of djinns was the city of rumors. The government had signed the Hamilton Act. Krishna Cops were sweeping house to house. Palmer files were to be monitored. Children&rsquo;s aeai toys were illegal. US marines were being airlifted in. Prime Minister Shrivastava was about to announce the replacement of the rupee with the dollar. A monsoon of fear and speculation and in the middle of it all was Ashok.</p>

<p><q>One final run, then I&rsquo;m out. Can you do this for me? One final run?</q></p>

<p>The bungalow was already half-emptied. The furniture was all packed, only his processor cores remained. They were draped in dustsheets, ghosts of the creatures that had lived there. The Krishna Cops were welcome to them.</p>

<p><q>We both go to Bharat?</q></p>

<p><q>No, that would be too dangerous. You go ahead, I&rsquo;ll follow when it&rsquo;s safe.</q> He hesitated. Tonight, even the traffic beyond the high walls sounded different. <q>I need you to take more than the usual.</q></p>

<p><q>How many?</q></p>

<p><q>Five.</q></p>

<p>He saw me shy back as he raised his hand to my forehead.</p>

<p><q>Is it safe?</q></p>

<p><q>Five, and that&rsquo;s it done. For good.</q></p>

<p><q>Is it safe?</q></p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s a series of overlays, they&rsquo;ll share core code in common.</q></p>

<p>It was a long time since I had turned my vision inward to the jewels Ashok had strung through my skull. Circuitry. A brain within a brain.</p>

<p><q>Is it safe?</q></p>

<p>I saw Ashok swallow, then bob his head: a Westerner&rsquo;s <i>yes</i>. I closed my eyes. Seconds later I felt the warm, dry touch of his finger to my inner eye.</p>

<p>We came to with the brass light of early morning shining through the <i>jali</i>. We were aware we were deeply dehydrated. We were aware that we were in need of slow-release carbohydrate. Our serotonin inhibitor levels were low. The window arch through which the sun beamed was a Mughal true arch. The protein circuits in my head were DPMA one-eight-seven-nine slash omegas, under licence from BioScan of Bangalore.</p>

<p>Everything we looked at gave off a rainbow of interpretations. I saw the world with the strange manias of my new guests: medic, nutritionist, architectural renderer, biochip designer, engineering aeai controlling a host of repair-shop robots. Nasatya. Vaishvanara. Maya. Brihaspati. Tvastri. My intimate demons. This was not <i>other</i>. This was <i>legion</i>. I was a many-headed <i>devi</i>.</p>

<p>All that morning, all afternoon, I fought to make sense of a world that was five worlds, five impressions. <i>I</i> fought. Fought to make us <i>me</i>. Ashok fretted, tugging at his woolly beard, pacing, trying to watch television, check his mails. At any instant Krishna Cop combat robots could come dropping over his walls. Integration would come. It had to come. I could not survive the clamor in my skull, a monsoon of interpretations. Sirens raced in the streets, far, near, far again. Every one of them fired off a different reaction from my selves.</p>

<p>I found Ashok sitting amongst his shrouded processors, knees pulled up to his chest, arms draped over them. He looked like a big, fat, soft boy, his Mama&rsquo;s favorite.</p>

<p><i>Noradrenaline pallor, mild hypoglycaemia, fatigue toxins</i>, said Nasatya.</p>

<p><i>Yin Systems bevabyte quantum storage arrays</i>, said Brihaspati simultaneously.</p>

<p>I touched him on the shoulder. He jerked awake. It was full dark outside, stifling: the monsoon was already sweeping up through the United States of Bengal.</p>

<p><q>We&rsquo;re ready,</q> I said. <q><i>I&rsquo;m</i> ready.</q></p>

<p>Dark-scented hibiscus spilled over the porch where the Mercedes waited.</p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;ll see you in a week,</q> he said. <q>In Varanasi.</q></p>

<p><q>In Varanasi.</q></p>

<p>He took my shoulders in his hands and kissed me lightly, on the cheek. I drew my <i>dupatta</i> over my head. Veiled, I was taken to the United Provinces Night Sleeper Service. As I lay in the first class compartment the aeais chattered away inside my head, surprised to discover each other, reflections of reflections.</p>

<p>The <i>chowkidar</i> brought me bed-tea on a silver tray in the morning. Dawn came up over Varanasi&rsquo;s sprawling slums and industrial parks. My personalized news-service aeai told me that Lok Sabha would vote on ratifying the Hamilton Accords at ten am. At twelve, Prime Minister Shrivastava and the United States Ambassador would announce a Most Favored Nation trade package with Awadh.</p>

<p>The train emptied onto the platform beneath the spun-diamond canopy I knew so well. Every second passenger, it seemed, was a smuggler. If I could spot them so easily, so could the Krishna Cops. They lined the exit ramps, more than I had ever seen before. There were uniforms behind them and robots behind the uniforms. The porter carried my bag on his head; I used it to navigate the press of people pouring off the night train. <i>Walk straight, as your Mamaji taught you. Walk tall and proud, like you are walking the Silken Way with a rich man</i>. I drew my <i>dupatta</i> over my head, for modesty. Then I saw the crowd piling up at the ramp. The Krishna Cops were scanning every passenger with palmers.</p>

<p>I could see the <i>badmashs</i> and smuggler-boys hanging back, moving to the rear of the mill of bodies. But there was no escape there either. Armed police backed by riot-control robots took up position at the end of the platform. Shuffle by shuffle, the press of people pushed me toward the Krishna Cops, waving their right hands like blessings over the passengers. Those things could peel back my scalp and peer into my skull. My red case bobbed ahead, guiding me to my cage.</p>

<p>Brihaspati showed me what they would do to the circuits in my head.</p>

<p><i>Help me!</i> I prayed to my gods. And Maya, architect of the demons, answered me. Its memories were my memories and it remembered rendering an architectural simulation of this station long before robot construction spiders started to spin their nano-diamond web. Two visions of Varanasi station, superimposed. With one difference that might save my life. Maya&rsquo;s showed me the inside of things. The inside of the platform. The drain beneath the hatch between the rear of the <i>chai</i>-booth and the roof support.</p>

<p>I pushed through the men to the small dead space at the rear. I hesitated before I knelt beside the hatch. One surge of the crowd, one trip, one fall, and I would be crushed. The hatch was jammed shut with dirt. Nails broke, nails tore as I scrabbled it loose and heaved it up. The smell that came up from the dark square was so foul I almost vomited. I forced myself in, dropped a meter into shin-deep sludge. The rectangle of light showed me my situation. I was mired in excrement. The tunnel forced me to crawl but the end of it was promise, the end of it was a semi-circle of daylight. I buried my hands in the soft sewage. This time I did retch up my bed tea. I crept forward, trying not to choke. It was vile beyond anything I had ever experienced. But not so vile as having your skull opened and knives slice away slivers of your brain. I crawled on my hands and knees under the tracks of Varanasi Station, to the light, to the light, to the light, and out through the open conduit into the cess lagoon where pigs and rag-pickers rooted in the shoals of drying human manure.</p>

<p>I washed as clean as I could in the shriveled canal. <i>Dhobi</i>-wallahs beat laundry against stone slabs. I tried to ignore Nasatya&rsquo;s warnings about the hideous infections I might have picked up.</p>

<p>I was to meet Ashok&rsquo;s girl on the street of <i>gajras</i>. Children sat in doorways and open shop fronts threading marigolds onto needles. The work was too cheap even for robots. Blossoms spilled from bushels and plastic cases. My <i>phatphat</i>&rsquo;s tires slipped on wet rose petals. We drove beneath a canopy of <i>gajra</i> garlands that hung from poles above the shop-fronts. Everywhere was the smell of dead, rotting flowers. The <i>phatphat</i> turned into a smaller, darker alley and into the back of a mob. The driver pressed his hand to the horn. The people reluctantly gave him way. The alcofuel engine whined. We crept forward. Open space, then a police <i>jawan</i> stepped forward to bar our way. He wore full combat armor. Brihaspati read the glints of data flickering across his visor: deployments, communications, an arrest warrant. I covered my head and lower face as the driver talked to him. What&rsquo;s going on? Some <i>badmash</i>. Some dataraja.</p>

<p>Down the street of <i>gajras</i>, uniformed police led by a plainclothes Krishna Cop burst open a door. Their guns were drawn. In the same breath, the shutters of the <i>jharoka</i> immediately above crashed up. A figure jumped up onto the wooden rail. Behind me, the crowd let out a vast roaring sigh. <i>There he is there the badmash oh look look it&rsquo;s a girl!</i></p>

<p>From the folds of my <i>dupatta</i> I saw Ashok&rsquo;s <i>girli</i> teeter there an instant, then jump up and grab a washing line. It snapped and swung her ungently down through racks of marigold garlands into the street. She crouched a moment, saw the police, saw the crowd, saw me, then turned and ran. The <i>jawan</i> started toward her, but there was another quicker, deadlier. A woman screamed as the robot bounded from the rooftop into the alley. Chrome legs pistoned, its insect head bobbed, locked on. Marigold petals flew up around the fleeing girl but everyone knew she could not escape the killing thing. One step, two step, it was behind her. I saw her glance over her shoulder as the robot unsheathed its blade.</p>

<p>I knew what would happen next. I had seen it before, in the petal-strewn streets of Kathmandu, as I rode my litter among my gods and Kumarimas.</p>

<p>The blade flashed. A great cry from the crowd. The girl&rsquo;s head bounded down the alley<i>.</i> A great jet of blood. Sacrificial blood. The headless body took one step, two.</p>

<p>I slipped from the <i>phatphat</i> and stole away through the transfixed crowd.</p>

<p>I saw the completion of the story on a news channel at a <i>chai-dhaba</i> by the tank on Scindia <i>ghat</i>. The tourists, the faithful, the vendors and funeral parties were my camouflage. I sipped <i>chai</i> from a plastic cup and watched the small screen above the bar. The sound was low but I could understand well enough from the pictures. Delhi police break up a notorious aeai smuggling ring. In a gesture of Bharati-Awadhi friendship, Varanasi Krishna cops make a series of arrests. The camera cut away before the robot struck. The final shot was of Ashok, pushed down into a Delhi police car in plastic handcuffs.</p>

<p>I went to sit on the lowest <i>ghat</i>. The river would still me, the river would guide me. It was of the same substance as me, divinity. Brown water swirled at my be-ringed toes. That water could wash away all earthly sin. On the far side of the holy river, tall chimneys poured yellow smoke into the sky. A tiny round-faced girl came up to me, offered me marigold <i>gajras</i> to buy. I waved her away. I saw again this river, these <i>ghats</i>, these temples and boats as I had when I lay in my wooden room in my palace in Durbar Square. I saw now the lie Tall Kumarima&rsquo;s palmer had fed me. I had thought India a jeweled skirt, laid out for me to wear. It was a bride-buyer with an envelope of rupees, it was walking the Silken Way until feet cracked and bled. It was a husband with the body of a child and the appetites of a man warped by his impotence. It was a savior who had always only wanted me for my sickness. It was a young girl&rsquo;s head rolling in a gutter.</p>

<p>Inside this still-girl&rsquo;s head, my demons were silent. They could see as well as I that that there would never be a home for us in Bharat, Awadh, Maratha, any nation of India.</p>

<br/>

<p>North of Nayarangadh the road rose through wooded ridges, climbing steadily up to Mugling where it turned and clung to the side of the Trisuli&rsquo;s steep valley. It was my third bus in as many days. I had a routine now. Sit at the back, wrap my <i>dupatta</i> round me, look out the window. Keep my hand on my money. Say nothing.</p>

<p>I picked up the first bus outside Jaunpur. After emptying Ashok&rsquo;s account, I thought it best to leave Varanasi as inconspicuously as possible. I did not need Brihaspati to show me the hunter aeais howling after me. Of course they would have the air, rail, and bus stations covered. I rode out of the Holy City on an unlicensed taxi. The driver seemed pleased with the size of the tip. The second bus took me from Gorakhpur through the <i>dhal</i> fields and banana plantations to Nautanwa on the border. I had deliberately chosen small, out-of-the-way Nautanwa, but still I bowed my head and shuffled my feet as I came up to the Sikh emigration officer behind his tin counter. I held my breath. He waved me through without even a glance at my identity card.</p>

<p>I walked up the gentle slope and across the border. Had I been blind, I would have known at once when I crossed into my kingdom. The great roar that had followed me as close as my own skin fell silent so abruptly it seemed to echo. The traffic did not blare its way through all obstacles. It steered, it sought ways around pedestrians and sacred cows lolling in the middle of the road, chewing. People were polite in the bureau where I changed my Bharati rupees for Nepalese; did not press and push and try to sell me things I did not want in the shop where I bought a bag of greasy <i>samosas</i>; smiled shyly to me in the cheap hotel where I hired a room for the night. Did not demand demand demand.</p>

<p>I slept so deeply that it felt like a fall through endless white sheets that smelled of sky. In the morning the third bus came to take me up to Kathmandu.</p>

<p>The road was one vast train of trucks, winding in and out of the bluffs, looping back on itself, all the while climbing, climbing. The gears on the old bus whined. The engine strove. I loved that sound, of engines fighting gravity. It was the sound of my earliest recollection, before the child-assessors came up a road just like this to Shakya. Trains of trucks and buses in the night. I looked out at the roadside <i>dhabas</i>, the shrines of piled rocks, the tattered prayer banners bent in the wind, the cableways crossing the chocolate-creamy river far below, skinny kids kicking swaying cages across the high wires. So familiar, so alien to the demons that shared my skull.</p>

<p>The baby must have been crying for some time before the noise rose above the background hubbub of the bus. The mother was two rows ahead of me, she shushed and swung and soothed the tiny girl but the cries were becoming screams.</p>

<p>It was Nasatya made me get out of my seat and go to her.</p>

<p><q>Give her to me,</q> I said and there must have been some tone of command from the medical aeai in my voice for she passed me the baby without a thought. I pulled back the sheet in which she was wrapped. The little girl&rsquo;s belly was painfully bloated, her limbs floppy and waxen.</p>

<p><q>She&rsquo;s started getting colic when she eats,</q> the mother said but before she could stop me I pulled away her diaper. The stench was abominable; the excrement bulky and pale.</p>

<p><q>What are you feeding her?</q></p>

<p>The woman held up a <i>roti</i> bread, chewed at the edges to soften it for baby. I pushed my fingers into the baby&rsquo;s mouth to force it open though Vaishvanara the nutritionist already knew what we would find. The tongue was blotched red, pimpled with tiny ulcers.</p>

<p><q>Has this only started since you began giving her solid food?</q> I asked. The mother waggled her head in agreement. <q>This child has ceoliac disease,</q> I pronounced. The woman put her hands to her face in horror, began to rock and wail. <q>Your child will be fine, you must just stop feeding her bread, anything made from any grain except rice. She cannot process the proteins in wheat and barley. Feed her rice, rice and vegetables and she will brighten up right away.</q></p>

<p>The entire bus was staring as I went back to my seat. The woman and her baby got off at Naubise. The child was still wailing, weak now from its rage, but the woman raised a <i>namaste</i> to me. A blessing. I had come to Nepal with no destination, no plan or hope, just a need to be back. But already an idea was forming</p>

<p>Beyond Naubise the road climbed steadily, switching back and forth over the buttresses of the mountains that embraced Kathmandu. Evening was coming on. Looking back I could see the river of headlights snaking across the mountainside. Where the bus ground around another hairpin bend, I could see the same snake climb up ahead of me in red taillights. The bus labored up a long steep climb. I could hear, everyone could hear, the noise in the engine that should not have been there. Up we crawled to the high saddle where the watershed divided, right to the valley of Kathmandu, left to Pokhara and the High Himalaya. Slower, slower. We could all smell the burning insulation, hear the rattling.</p>

<p>It was not me who rushed to the driver and his mate. It was the demon Trivasti.</p>

<p><q>Stop stop at once!</q> I cried. <q>Your alternator has seized! You will burn us up.</q></p>

<p>The driver pulled into the narrow draw, up against the raw rock. On the offside, trucks passed with millimeters to spare. We got the hood up. We could see the smoke wafting from the alternator. The men shook their heads and pulled out palmers. The passengers piled to the front of the bus to stare and talk.</p>

<p><q>No no no, give me a wrench,</q> I ordered.</p>

<p>The driver stared but I shook my outstretched hand, demanding. Perhaps he remembered the crying baby. Perhaps he was thinking about how long it would take a repair truck to come up from Kathmandu. Perhaps he was thinking about how good it would be to be home with his wife and children. He slapped the monkey wrench into my hand. In less than a minute I had the belt off and the alternator disconnected.</p>

<p><q>Your bearings have seized,</q> I said. <q>It&rsquo;s a persistent fault on pre-2030 models. A hundred meters more and you would have burned her out. You can drive her on the battery. There&rsquo;s enough in it to get you down to Kathmandu.</q></p>

<p>They stared at this little girl in an Indian sari, head covered but sleeves of her <i>choli</i> rolled up and fingers greasy with biolube.</p>

<p>The demon returned to his place and it was clear as the darkening sky what I would do now. The driver and his mate called out to me as I walked up beside the line of vehicles to the head of the pass. We ignored them. Passing drivers sounded their multiple, musical horns, offered lifts. I walked on. I could see the top now. It was not far to the place where the three roads divided. Back to India, down to the city, up to the mountains.</p>

<p>There was a <i>chai-dhaba</i> at the wide, oil-stained place where vehicles turned. It was bright with neon signs for American drinks and Bharati mineral water, like something fallen from the stars. A generator chugged. A television burbled familiar, soft Nepali news. The air smelled of hot <i>ghee</i> and biodiesel.</p>

<p>The owner did not know what to make of me, strange little girl in my Indian finery. Finally he said, <q>Fine night.</q></p>

<p>It was. Above the smogs and soots of the valley, the air was magically clear. I could see for a lifetime in any direction. To the west the sky held a little last light. The great peaks of Manaslu and Anapurna glowed mauve against the blue.</p>

<p><q>It is,</q> I said, <q>oh it is.</q></p>

<p>Traffic pushed slowly past, never ceasing on this high crossroads of the world. I stood in the neon flicker of the <i>dhaba</i>, looking long at the mountains and I thought, <i>I shall live there</i>. We shall live in a wooden house close to trees with running water cold from high snow. We shall have a fire and a television for company and prayer banners flying in the wind and in time people will stop being afraid and will come up the path to our door. There are many ways to be divine. There is the big divine, of ritual and magnificence and blood and terror. Ours shall be a little divinity, of small miracles and everyday wonders. Machines mended, programs woven, people healed, homes designed, minds and bodies fed. I shall be a little goddess. In time, the story of me will spread and people will come from all over; Nepalis and foreigners, travelers and hikers and monks. Maybe one day a man who is not afraid. That would be good. But if he does not come, that will be good also, for I shall never be alone, not with a houseful of demons.</p>

<p>Then I found I was running, with the surprised <i>chai-wallah</i> calling, <q>Hey! Hey! Hey!</q> after me, running down the side of the slow-moving line of traffic, banging on the doors, <q>Hi! Hi! Pokhara! Pokhara!</q> slipping and sliding over the rough gravel, toward the far, bright mountains.</p>
