      <h1>Filesystems</h1>

      <p>The methods of organizing files in a computer system can be broadly divided into two categories: singly-rooted and mount-oriented.</p>
      
      <section>
        <h1>Mount-Oriented Filesystems</h1>
        
        <p>Microsoft&trade; Windows is the most popular operating system built on a mount-oriented filesystem. This means that the available storage is defined in terms of the locations of storage devices. Each location is assigned a letter which serves as the base for a hierachical filesystem.</p>

        <pre><code>
          <var:uhn>
            <var:storage><var:id>C</var:id>:</var:storage><var:path>\Users\Bob\My Documents\Sales Talk.ppt</var:path>
          </var:uhn>
        </code></pre>

        <p>For example, <a href="">Figure 1</a> shows the location of a file at <q>drive letter</q> <code>C</code>. The total storage of the system can be represented as a graph:</p>

          <h1>Holon</h1>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Arthur Koestler coined the term <q>holon</q> to refer to an entity that is itself a <em>whole</em> and simultaneously a <em>part</em> of some other whole. And if you start to look closely at the things and processes that actually exist, it soon becomes obvious that they are not merely wholes, they are also parts of something else. They are whole/parts, they are holons.</p>
            <p>For instance, a whole atom is part ofa whole molecule, and the whole molecule is part of a whole cell, and the whole cell is part of a whole organism, and so on. Eaeh of these entities is neither a whole nor a part, but a whole/part, a holon.</p>
            <p>And the point is, everything is basically a holon of some sort or another. There is a two-thousand-year old philosophical squabble between atomists and wholists; which is ultimately real, the whole or the part? And the answer is, neither. Or both, if you prefer. There are only whole/parts in all directions, all the way up, all the way down.</p>
            <p>There's an old joke about a King who goes to a Wiseperson and asks how it is that the Earth doesn't fall down. The Wiseperson replies, <q>The Earth is resting on a lion.</q> <q>On what, then, is the lion resting?</q> <q>The lion is resting on an elephant.</q> <q>On what is the elephant resting?</q> <q>The elephant is resting on a turtle.</q> <q>On what is the&hellip;?</q> <q>You can stop right there, Your Majesty. It's turtles all the way down.</q></p>
            <p>Turtles all the way down, holons all the way down. No matter how far down we go, we find holons resting on holons resting on holons. Even subatomic particles disappear into a virtual cloud of bubbles within bubbles, holons within holons, in an infinity of probability waves. Holons all the way down.</p>
