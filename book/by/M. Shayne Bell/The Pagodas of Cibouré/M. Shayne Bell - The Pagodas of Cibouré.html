<h1>The Pagodas of Cibour&eacute;</h1>
<h2>by M. Shayne Bell</h2>
<h3>from <cite>The Green Man: Tales From the Mythic Forest</cite> (2002)</h3>

<p>On a day of the summer Maurice nearly died, his mother carried him to the banks of the Nieve River and his life changed forever. He was ten years old then. It was a warm day around noon in June of 1885. A gentle breeze blew off the bay, and from where they sat Maurice and his mother could smell the salt of the sea. His mother believed such breezes could heal.</p>

<p><q>When will Papa be here?</q> he asked his mother.</p>

<p><q>Any day,</q> she said. <q>His letter said he would come soon.</q></p>

<p><q>Will he bring a doctor to bleed me?</q></p>

<p><q>Hush,</q> she said. She brushed the hair across his forehead. <q>No one will bleed you in Ciboure, Maurice. I won't let them.</q></p>

<p>Maurice leaned against his mother and slept for a time in the sunlight. When he woke, he wanted to walk along the river. Yes, he had a fever, and yes, he did not feel well, but he wanted to walk upstream. He felt drawn to something in that direction, curious about what might lie just out of sight. His mother watched him totter along. <q>Don't go too far,</q> she said, glad that he felt well enough to do this on his own but anxious that he not hurt himself.</p>

<p>Maurice worked his way slowly up the riverbank. He picked a reed and swished it at the grasses ahead. The grasses gave way to flowered bushes, and the land rose gently to a forest. The water of the little river gurgled over rocks as it rushed clear and cold down from the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>Not far into the trees, in a wide glen, Maurice came upon the walls of an abandoned pottery. Five hundred years before this workshop had sold sparkling dinner plates and soup bowls to Moorish and Christian princes. After the region had passed to France, its wares had been treasured in the palaces and mansions of Paris, Lyon, and Marseilles. But most of the wealthy family who owned the pottery had been guillotined in the Revolution. The few survivors had not returned to open it again.</p>

<p>The roof had now caved in. Windows in the stone walls were sunny holes. Maurice stood on his tiptoes and looked through one of the windows. He saw grass growing where workers had once hurried about polished floors.</p>

<p>Maurice walked around the ruined building and stopped in surprise. Three high mounds down by the river glittered in sunlight as if covered in jewels. He had never seen anything like it. Among the daisies and the wild roses and the lacy ferns sunlight gleamed and sparkled on what looked from a distance like gems. It was as if he had wandered into a fairy treasury.</p>

<p><q>Mother!</q> he called because he wanted her to see this. <q>Mother!</q></p>

<p>But she was too far away to hear. Then he decided to be quiet: if there were jewels on those mounds he did not want to attract anyone else walking in the forest. He would fill his pockets first, then he would lead his mother here. If he had found jewels, they could buy a seaside mansion and he would get well and his father would come to live with them. They would all be happy again.</p>

<p>He walked slowly down to the mounds. His feet crunched on the ground, and he realized he was walking on broken china and glass. When he got to the mounds, he could see that that was what sparkled in the sunlight-broken dishes. The mounds were the old trash heaps of the pottery. There would be no fortune here.</p>

<p>Maurice scooped up a big handful of the shards, careful not to cut himself, and he carried them to the river. He held them down into the water and let the water wash away the dirt that had blown over the shards all the years. After a moment he shook out the water and spread his handful of broken china wet and glittery on the riverbank. Some shards were edged with a gold rim. One had a black fleur-de-lys entirely complete. Three pieces were from a set of blue china so delicate and clear he could see shadow through them when he held them up to the light.</p>

<p>Maurice was tired and hot. He sat breathing heavily for a time. When the breeze moved the branches overhead, sunlight sparkled on the broken china that had washed into the shallow riverbed. Maurice liked this place. Even if there were no jewels, it was nice to dream about being rich. It was nice to dream about being well again. This was a place that invited dreams.</p>

<p>He sat quietly just long enough for the things that had gone still at his approach to start moving and singing again. First the birds, then the butterflies, then Maurice saw clusters of pieces of china moving slowly over the ground: one cluster, then another, then more than he could count. They moved slowly between the flowers and around the stands of grass.</p>

<p>Maurice sat very, very still. He did not know what was making the pieces of china cluster together and move. He shivered, but he did not dare run. He watched very carefully, hardly daring to breathe. Sometimes only three shards moved together. Sometimes a handful. The pieces that moved were bright and clean, and the sharp edges had all been polished away. One small clump of six snowy-white shards came upon the pieces Maurice had washed. It stopped by one of the blue ones, and drew back as if amazed.</p>

<p>It was then that Maurice heard the singing. It was an odd music, soft and indistinct, and he had to struggle to hear it at all. The simplest birdsong would drown it out. But the white china shards tinkled as they moved, and amidst the tinkling a high, clear voice sang. He thought the music sounded Chinese.</p>

<p>Other clusters of shards hurried up-pink clumps and white clumps and some with each shard a different color or design. With so many gathered around him Maurice could hear their music clearly. Somehow, surrounded by music, Maurice forgot to be afraid. Creatures that made music would not hurt him, he thought. They seemed to debate in their songs the merits of each piece he had washed. Maurice slowly reached out and picked up the white shard with the black fleur-de-lys. He set it down by a small cluster of terra-cotta shards and thought it made a fine addition.</p>

<p>All movement and song stopped. The clusters sank slowly to the ground. No one walking by would have noticed them or thought them special at all. Maurice put his hand back in his lap and sat still. He wanted them to move once more. He wanted them to sing.</p>

<p>It took some time for it to happen again. After the birds had been singing by themselves for a long time and when the butterflies were fluttering about Maurice's head, the terra-cotta pieces slowly drew themselves up into a terraced pattern, the larger pieces on the bottom, the smaller on top. It held the fleur-de-lys shard in the middle, as if it were a shield.</p>

<p>You look like a pine tree, Maurice thought.</p>

<p>But the more he looked at it, the more he realized it looked like a Chinese temple. He knew then what these creatures were. <q>Pagodas,</q> he whispered. <q>Pagodas!</q></p>

<p>His mother had told him stories about them. They were creatures made of jewels, crystal, and porcelain who lived in the forests of France. If you were good to them, they could heal you. He had thought the stories mere fairy tales.</p>

<p>He looked at the glittery river and the sparkling mounds and then at the shining shards around him. <q>Please heal me,</q> he whispered. <q>I want to get better. Please help me.</q></p>

<p>He did not know how it would happen. He thought that maybe he should touch one of them. Some power might flow into him and make him well if he did. He reached out and gently touched the terra-cotta shards.</p>

<p>They sank down at once. He picked up each piece, then put it back in its place. He saw nothing among them. He found no hint of what a pagoda inside its shell of shards might look like. <q>Please help me,</q> he whispered. <q>Mother's doctors can't, and I don't want Papa's to bleed me again.</q></p>

<p>Nothing around him moved now. When he heard his mother calling, he stood up very carefully. He did not want to step on the pagodas. He took off his shoes and planned each footstep before he took it. He tried to walk on grass and flowers, not the broken china. He hoped he had not hurt a single pagoda.</p>

<p>His mother met him at the steps of the pottery where he sat lacing his shoes. <q>You have been gone a long time,</q> she said. She looked around as she waited for him. <q>Oh, this is pretty here. The trash heaps glitter so. You shouldn't walk barefoot to the river, Maurice-you could cut your feet on the glass!</q></p>

<p><q>I was careful, Mother,</q> Maurice said.</p>

<p>She smiled and took his hand. They walked home slowly.</p>

<p>She did not have to carry him.</p>

<br/>

<p>That night, while the fever made him wobbly, Maurice pulled the box that held his favorite things out from beneath his bed. Inside were all the letters from his father carefully tied with a red ribbon. He set them aside. There were the thirteen francs he'd been able to save, wrapped in a note to his parents asking them to divide the money. He set that aside as well. There was the bright red, white, and blue pouch that held the set of seven tin soldiers his grandmother had sent him from Switzerland.</p>

<p>And there was his kaleidoscope. It was his most treasured possession. It was a shiny brass tube filled with mirrors. A person looked through one end to see the glorious patterns; the other was a chamber that could be screwed off and opened. Into that chamber Maurice would put pieces of broken glass and the beads and the strips of colored paper and string that made the intricate images in the kaleidoscope. The most common objects could become beautiful there. He could change the images whenever he wanted, and he and his mother had spent pleasant hours walking along the roadsides looking for broken, colored glass small enough to fit inside. He unscrewed the chamber and picked out three bright blue glass shards and one crystal bead. He took the tin soldiers out of their pouch and laid them in a row along the bottom of the box. Then he put the pieces of glass and the bead in the pouch.</p>

<p>He would take them to the pagodas, he thought. Maybe if he gave them something they would help him.</p>

<br/>

<p>In the morning, his nose would not stop bleeding. He kept old pieces of rag stuffed up his nose and his mother made him lie down, but every time he removed the rags, his nose would bleed again.</p>

<p><q>Will Papa come today?</q> he asked.</p>

<p><q>He may, or he may arrive tomorrow morning. It won't be long.</q></p>

<p>Maurice thought about that. He wanted to see his papa. He felt better when his papa held him. But he did not like the doctor his papa took him to, and neither did his mother. The good doctors, as his mother called them, had said to keep him comfortable and to give him medicines to take away the pain. The doctor papa had found believed he could cure Maurice if he bled him. Papa had had to hold him down while the doctor had cut his arm and let his blood drip into a bowl. It had made him dizzy and sick, and he had embarrassed everyone by crying. It was why his mother had taken him away from Paris to his grandmother's house in Ciboure.</p>

<p><q>Can we walk to the river again?</q> he asked.</p>

<p>His mother laughed, but then she looked out the window and put down her sewing. How many mornings would he want do to something like this? she wondered. A nosebleed was manageable.</p>

<p>She packed them a lunch and extra rags for his nose. They walked slowly to the river. Maurice could not wait to be gone. After eating a few bites, he stuffed some of the rags into his pockets and started for the trees. His mother was glad to see him take exercise, but she could not help herself. <q>Be careful, Maurice,</q> she called.</p>

<p>The day was chill, and Maurice wore a heavy sweater. He took off his shoes when he came to the old rubbish heaps. He stepped very carefully down to the river, careful not to crush clumps of china shards and careful not to cut his feet. He started to be able to distinguish the shards that made up a pagoda's shell: they were the shiny and polished ones, the ones with bits of color, not the ones caked with mud or dust.</p>

<p>He inspected the ground before he sat down, and he sat where he had sat the day before. He listened, but he heard no Chinese music. <q>Pagodas?</q> he whispered. <q>Pagodas?</q></p>

<p>Nothing stirred. He looked around and saw a few clumps that he recognized: the terra-cotta shards, still with the black fleur-de-lys; the light pink shards; clumps that were all white.</p>

<p><q>Don't be afraid,</q> he whispered. <q>I've brought you presents.</q></p>

<p>He took the pouch out of his pocket and opened it in his lap. He took out one of the pieces of blue glass and set it by the nearest snowy white clump. He wasn't sure, but he thought it might have shivered ever so slightly at his touch. He waited for a time, then he set the crystal bead by the terra-cotta shards.</p>

<p>Slowly, shard by shard, the terra-cotta pieces rose up. He watched the bead roll along the different shards, passed from one to another until it stood balanced on the very top.</p>

<p>Other pagodas began to move then. They rose up and gathered warily around Maurice, keeping their distance. He could hear their tinkly music again, and all at once he understood part of what they were asking him.</p>

<p><q>I'm Maurice,</q> he said. <q>My name is Maurice Ravel.</q></p>

<p>They sang at him, and he imagined that they were telling him their names. He had never heard one of those names before. He thought the terra-cotta shards were saying <q>Ti Ti Ting.</q></p>

<p><q>You <i>are</i> all Chinese!</q> he laughed.</p>

<p>Then he started coughing, and he could not stop coughing for a time. Most of the pagodas sank down to the ground while he coughed. But not Ti Ti Ting. It edged a little closer.</p>

<p><q>Can you help me?</q> Maurice asked it. <q>Can you make me well? Tell me what to do, and I will do it.</q></p>

<p>All the shards grew quiet. The music stopped completely.</p>

<p><q>I know my presents are not very valuable, but it was all I could think to bring you today.</q></p>

<p>Nothing happened. The pagodas did not tell him anything more then. After a time, Maurice could see pagodas moving all around him. The mounds were covered with them. He could see places where they were digging into the mounds-mining, he imagined, for shards to weave into their shells. In other places, they were forming what looked like protective walls four or five inches high with sharp-edged pieces of china poking out from them. He wondered what small enemies they could fear? Whatever it was, they were going about their business unconcerned with his presence.</p>

<p>When he heard his mother calling, he made his way barefoot back to the steps of the pottery. His mother met him there.</p>

<p><q>Is your nose still bleeding?</q> she asked.</p>

<p>Maurice took out the rags, but no blood followed. He threw the rags aside, and he and his mother walked home.</p>

<p>His nose did not bleed again that day.</p>

<br/>

<p>Before bed, his grandmother brewed him a tea from herbs she had sent for from Spain. A priest in San Sebastian had blessed the tea, and his grandmother had even paid to have the priest touch the cross of Saint Theresa of Avila to the little packet. His grandmother was sure the tea would cure Maurice. He drank the whole cup to please her. It did not taste bad.</p>

<p>His mother brought out her silver-handled brush from her bedroom and started brushing his grandmother's hair. She did this every night before they went to bed. He liked to lay his head in his grandmother's lap and watch her face while his mother brushed her hair. She would close her eyes and hold herself very still and lean her head back into the brushing. Sometimes Maurice fell asleep while he watched his grandmother, and his mother would have to wake him to take him to bed. He did not fall asleep that night. He lay awake on his grandmother's lap till his mother finished brushing, then she led him to bed.</p>

<p><q>Tell me about pagodas,</q> he asked as his mother tucked the blankets around his chin.</p>

<p><q>Oh, they are magic creatures!</q> she said. <q>They live in crystal and porcelain cities hidden in the forests. Few people see them or their cities these days. But when I was a little girl, your grandmother told me about an evil man who had found one of their cities not far from here. He tried to steal their jewels, but the pagodas attacked him with their crystal swords. He ran away, but bore the scars on his hands and feet the rest of his life. Because of those scars, everyone in Ciboure knew he was a thief so they could watch out for him.</q></p>

<p>She stood up to go.</p>

<p><q>Can pagodas heal people?</q> Maurice asked. <q>You told me before that they could.</q></p>

<p>She looked at Maurice, then she sat down on the edge of his bed and held his hands. <q>Sometimes in your sleep you can hear them singing,</q> she said. <q>They weave healing spells in their music. I hope you hear their music tonight, Maurice. I wish we had pagodas in the back garden. I'd set them on your windowsill and let them sing to you all night.</q></p>

<p>When his mother had gone, Maurice touched his nose. It still was not bleeding, though it had bled most days since winter. He thought of the walks he could take now on his own, despite the fevers.</p>

<p>The pagodas were helping him. He was sure of it. If he could stay here long enough, they would cure him.</p>

<br/>

<p>Maurice slept soundly but heard no music. He woke to the sound of his parents arguing softly in the kitchen. His father had come. Part of him wanted to jump out of bed and run to his father's arms, but he did not do that. Instead he lay listening to what his parents were saying. He could not hear the words clearly. He got out of bed and crept to the door. He heard his father say <q>doctor</q> and <q>bleeding.</q> Then, <q>I want him to get well too! He's my son.</q></p>

<p><q>I won't let anyone bleed him again!</q> his mother said.</p>

<p><q>Does he still bruise easily? Does he still have fevers?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, but-</q></p>

<p><q>Then Dr. Perrault knows how to help him! He uses ancient treatments for fevers and swelling, nosebleeds and abnormal bruising in children. I trust his techniques more than herbs and priests' blessings.</q></p>

<p><q>Maurice is improving here. What Mother and I are doing is helping, though whether priests' blessings have anything to do with it I don't know. He is strong enough now to take walks every day. He sleeps through the nights. How could he ever sleep in Paris with all the street traffic?</q></p>

<p><q>You are wearing yourself out,</q> his father said. <q>You can't do everything for him. None of us knows enough, Marie.</q></p>

<p><q>I know enough not to hurt him.</q></p>

<p><q>The other doctors we took him to had given up-they said to just keep him comfortable. At least Dr. Perrault had reason to think he could save him. Don't you think we should try, Marie? Don't you think we'd wonder the rest of our lives if we didn't try?</q></p>

<p>Maurice had heard enough. He stood and opened the door. He looked out at his parents sitting at the big wooden table in front of the fireplace. His grandmother was still locked in her bedroom.</p>

<p><q>Maurice,</q> his father said. He stood and hurried to his son. Maurice did not want his father to touch him, but his father knelt and hugged him close. <q>Look at you!</q> he said. <q>So brown from the sun. Our neighbors in Paris will think I've adopted a peasant boy when I bring you back home.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't want to go back to Paris,</q> Maurice said. <q>Don't take me there again.</q></p>

<p><q>Never go back to Paris? Who could say such a thing? Our home is in the greatest city of the world.</q></p>

<p><q>I love the forest here, Papa. It's magic.</q></p>

<p><q>All forests are magic,</q> his father said.</p>

<p>His mother was setting out dishes for breakfast, and when Grandmother came out they all sat at the table. There was cheese and fresh bread, strawberries and milk.</p>

<p><q>Don't ever take me back to Paris,</q> Maurice said before any of them could take a bite.</p>

<p>His mother and father looked at each other. They all ate in silence for a time.</p>

<p>His father cleared his throat. <q>When do you set out on your walks, Maurice?</q> he asked. <q>May I go with you today? I want to see this magic forest of yours.</q></p>

<p>Maurice felt he had no choice but to take him. At noon that day, they set out. Maurice was nervous. He did not want his father accidentally stepping on the pagodas and crushing them. He decided not to take his father to the mounds of broken china. They would stop at the old pottery or even before they reached the trees. He'd claim to be sick, and his father would have to take him home.</p>

<p>His father carried a basket with a lunch in one hand, and he held Maurice's hand in the other. They passed his grandmother in her garden. She straightened up at their approach and bent her back.</p>

<p><q>What a lovely summer this is,</q> she said. <q>I find practically no slugs in the vegetables. The lettuce is free of slugs, and I found only one in the strawberries last week. Now if I could just keep the birds away.</q></p>

<p><q>I'll make you a scarecrow when we return,</q> Maurice's father said. <q>That should help.</q></p>

<p>She smiled and turned back to her hoeing. Maurice and his father walked to the river. Maurice was not very hungry. <q>You should eat to build up your strength,</q> his father said. <q>Here, take more of this rabbit breast. Meat will make you strong.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, Papa,</q> he said, and he did eat the meat. It was salty and good.</p>

<p><q>Are those trees the forest you walk to?</q> his father asked, pointing.</p>

<p>They were soon among the trees and at the ruined pottery. They walked slowly. Maurice's legs hurt, and he was not making that up. <q>Can we just sit here for a time?</q> Maurice asked, and they sat on the steps.</p>

<p>His father rubbed Maurice's legs, then he put an arm around Maurice's shoulders and hugged him close. <q>I-</q> he started to say something, but he stopped. He looked away. He just held Maurice.</p>

<p>Maurice looked down at the mounds. They glittered, but his papa said nothing about that. Maurice looked all over the ground for the pagodas, but he saw none. That didn't surprise him. They would have taken cover at their approach.</p>

<p>But there were things moving on the nearest mound. Dark things. Maurice sat up straight. His father kicked at something at their feet, and Maurice saw that it was a shelled slug. It lay for a moment in the dirt where his father had kicked it, then it started crawling toward the mounds.</p>

<p><q>Are those slugs on that mound, Papa?</q> Maurice asked.</p>

<p>His father looked where Maurice was pointing. <q>I think so,</q> he said. <q>How odd. I've never seen them gather like that.</q> He stood to walk over to the mound.</p>

<p>Maurice grabbed his hand. <q>Don't, Papa!</q></p>

<p><q>It's just slugs, Maurice.</q></p>

<p><q>We have to be careful where we walk. We could crush things and not mean to.</q></p>

<p><q>The slugs? You grandmother would be grateful if we stepped on them.</q></p>

<p><q>No, you don't understand. If we walk over there, let me show you where to step.</q></p>

<p>His father sat down beside him again. <q>So the magic begins here, does it? What is it we're trying not to crush?</q></p>

<p>His papa had a merry smile. Maurice knew that Papa thought this was a game he had made up, but Maurice didn't care. He had to get over to the mound to see what was happening.</p>

<p><q>Take off your shoes and step where I step,</q> Maurice said.</p>

<p>They unlaced their shoes, and his father followed along behind him. Maurice worried about his father's bigger feet, but he saw no pagodas along the way that his father might step on. None of the shards they passed were washed and polished.</p>

<p>The nearest mound was a frightening sight. It was covered in shelled slugs. They heaved themselves about it in a dark mass sometimes three or four deep.</p>

<p><q>Testacella,</q> his father said, <q>carnivorous slugs. They eat earthworms and other slugs. No wonder your grandmother's garden is free of slugs. If these testacella migrated through this region on their way here they would have cleaned out all the other varieties in their path.</q></p>

<p>Maurice was looking for the pagodas. Where would they have gone to escape this blight of slug-eating slugs?</p>

<p><q>I've never seen so many in one place,</q> his father said. <q>I wonder if it's their mating season?</q></p>

<p>Maurice felt a growing panic inside him. He knew it was selfish to think only of himself, but if the slugs had done something to the pagodas or if they had driven them away and he could not find them again he would never get well.</p>

<p><q>They seem to be trying to reach those other two mounds, but something is holding them back,</q> his father said.</p>

<p>It was the pagoda walls. Maurice understood now what the pagodas feared and why they had had to build walls. But what did the slugs want here? Where were the pagodas?</p>

<p>Then he saw the terra-cotta shards with the black fleur-de-lys scattered on the ground on the wrong side of the wall. Three slugs were nosing among the pieces. <q>No!</q> Maurice screamed.</p>

<p>He started for Ti Ti Ting.</p>

<p><q>Come back, Maurice!</q> his father said. <q>You'll cut your feet!</q></p>

<p>But Maurice did not cut his feet. He stepped on the grass and the flowers and the slugs. He was glad to crush the slugs underfoot. He threw the three slugs on Ti Ti Ting into the river and knelt to pick up the pieces of the pagoda.</p>

<p><q>What is it?</q> his father asked softly. He was standing next to him.</p>

<p><q>A pagoda,</q> Maurice said. He could barely talk. He would not cry, he told himself. He would not let himself cry in front of his father.</p>

<p>His father knelt down next to him. <q>What was the pagoda?</q></p>

<p>Maurice held out the terra-cotta shards in his hands for his father to see. He picked up the piece with the black fleur-de-lys. <q>I gave it this piece,</q> he said. <q>And I gave it a crystal bead. I can't find the bead.</q></p>

<p><q>There it is, by your right foot.</q> His father picked up the bead and handed it to Maurice.</p>

<p><q>I watched them building these walls,</q> Maurice said, nodding at the low walls in front of them. <q>I didn't know why they were doing it.</q></p>

<p><q>Your pagoda was a brave one then. He was fighting outside the walls.</q></p>

<p>Maurice saw some of the pagodas he recognized lying on the ground on the safe side of the walls: the pink one, the white one with the piece of blue glass he had given it, clumps of multicolored shards.</p>

<p><q>We have to go, Papa. They won't stand to fight if you are watching.</q></p>

<p>His father stood. He picked up a handful of slugs and threw them into the river.</p>

<p>Maurice stepped forward and set the pieces of Ti Ti Ting down by the other pagodas. Maybe they could do something for him. He wiped his eyes and watched for a moment, but none of the pagodas stood up. He wished he could make them trust his papa and get up to help Ti Ti Ting or at least get up to fight the slugs.</p>

<p><q>They've breached your wall over here,</q> his father said. <q>Let's get the slugs that have crawled onto that mound.</q></p>

<p><q>It's not my wall,</q> Maurice said.</p>

<p><q>The pagodas' wall, I meant,</q> he said.</p>

<p>Maurice went after the slugs that had crossed the wall. They were nosing down among the pagoda shards on the ground in the area. They were eating them! Maurice knew as he stepped along that he was probably stepping on pagodas not just slugs. He didn't know what was worse: his crushing weight or the carnivorous slugs. He threw handful after handful of slugs into the river. His legs hurt and his arms hurt, and his nose started bleeding again.</p>

<p><q>Maurice,</q> his father called. <q>Let's go home. You've done all you can do to help here.</q></p>

<p>They sat on the steps of the ruined pottery and pulled off their slimy socks. <q>Just throw them away,</q> his father said. <q>No one would want to wash them.</q></p>

<p>They rubbed their feet on the grass, then pulled on their shoes. Maurice had to turn his head so blood wouldn't drip onto his shoes while he tied them. He found the bloody rags he had thrown away days before and stuffed them back up his nose. He could see more slugs in the grass making their way slowly toward the mounds.</p>

<p><q>The pagodas were helping me, Papa. They were healing me.</q></p>

<p>His papa considered that for a moment. <q>I'm sure they were,</q> he said. <q>We all want to help you. Your grandmother tries with her priests. Your mother gives you good food, rest, and quiet. I would do anything for you too, Maurice. I've tried. I'm sure the pagodas did what they could.</q></p>

<p>He took his son's hand and led him away. When they came to the road, he had to carry Maurice.</p>

<br/>

<p>But Maurice decided he had not done everything he could to help the pagodas. He lay feverish in his bed and listened to his parents talk quietly at the table. His father was trying to convince his mother to go back to Paris in a week or so. He knew what would happen there. Never mind Dr. Perrault and the bleeding. He knew what would happen to him without the pagodas.</p>

<p>And the pagodas themselves needed help. He could not let the slugs eat them whether they helped him or not. No one would believe him about the pagodas, of course. They thought he had made it all up.</p>

<p>After his parents and his grandmother had gone to bed, and after he had listened to his father snore for some time, Maurice crept out from under the covers. He had kept on his clothes and covered up before his mother had come to tuck him in, so no one had guessed that he was still dressed. He pulled on a sweater. He picked up his shoes, opened the bedroom door, and looked around the main room. No one was up. He walked barefoot to the kitchen and set a chair carefully by the cupboard. He stood on the chair and opened the top cupboard. He took out his grandmother's sack of salt. He would give her some of his money later to pay for it. Slugs hated salt. He'd use it to drive them away from the pagodas.</p>

<p>He closed the front door quietly behind him and set out down the road. There was a bright moon, and the road shined clearly ahead. He had to rest by the river, but soon he was at the ruined pottery.</p>

<p>It was darker there among the trees. The wind sighed in the branches. It felt different being among the trees at night. Maybe the slugs had changed the feeling of the forest, Maurice thought. He hurried up to the mounds. The slugs had breached the wall again and had covered half of the second mound. He looked frantically about for the pagodas, but saw none. He looked for the pieces of Ti Ti Ting, but they had been moved from where he had set them. The pagodas he had lain Ti Ti Ting next to had all moved somewhere else, too.</p>

<p>He looked around for the pagodas. <q>Don't be afraid,</q> he called. <q>It's Maurice. I've come to help you fight!</q></p>

<p>He started scattering salt onto the slugs at his feet. They curled up quickly into little balls at the slightest touch of salt. He took a handful of salt and threw it onto a mass of heaped slugs higher up the mound by the opening of what Maurice had thought was a pagoda mine. The slugs writhed and rolled around when the salt touched them. They would pull back into their segmented shells, then stick all the way out, then pull back inside. How the salt must hurt them, Maurice thought, but he had to try to help the pagodas. There was no stopping now.</p>

<p><q>Where are you?</q> Maurice called to the pagodas. <q>I have only one bag of salt. Show me how best to help you before it's all gone.</q></p>

<p>Then he saw a pagoda, one of the white ones-the white one with the piece of blue glass. It was standing just around the edge of the second mound. It held up the piece of glass as if in salute. But then Maurice saw that it was pointing. He looked and saw a huge mass of slugs slowly crawling over the wall and swarming over the depression between the second and third mounds.</p>

<p>Maurice had an idea what they were swarming over-what they were eating there!</p>

<p><q>I'm coming!</q> Maurice called.</p>

<p>He surprised the slugs from behind. He scattered salt over the slugs massed at the wall and left them writhing there. He started scattering salt on the huge heap of slugs in the depression, but there were so many. He picked up handful after handful and threw them into the river, then he scattered more salt.</p>

<p>He saw more pagodas, the pink ones and the white ones and all the multicolored ones. They were standing in a defensive line at the base of the third mound-and they <i>did</i> carry crystal swords! Maurice saw them glitter in the moonlight. The swords were as thin as needles. He watched them stab the slugs in the mouth with them. They would wait till a slug loomed over them, its mouth gaping open, then they would strike with their swords and pull back quickly. The slugs would snap about and try to bite them, but some fell over and did not move again.</p>

<p>The pagodas were stabbing through the mouth into the brain, Maurice realized.</p>

<p>He did not see Ti Ti Ting.</p>

<p><q>Ti Ti Ting!</q> Maurice called. <q>Ti Ti Ting!</q></p>

<p>But he could not see him.</p>

<p><q>Did the slugs kill him?</q> he asked the other pagodas, but they did not have time to sing answers to his questions.</p>

<p>Maurice kept scattering salt and throwing slugs into the river. He started to conserve the salt. He threw only slugs he hadn't salted into the river. The pagodas advanced on the slugs he had salted, and they could easily dispatch them with their swords as they writhed about in salty agony. Maurice threw unsalted slugs until he had to rest. He sat down on a part of the third mound free of slugs and free of pagodas and changed the rags in his nose. His nose was bleeding steadily. He tried to stopper it up tight, though he knew the blood would soak through the rags and start dripping onto his clothes again.</p>

<p>He wanted to sleep. He was tired. He was feverish. But there were more and more slugs.</p>

<p>Then he saw Ti Ti Ting. He was drooping in a depression of the third mound. Maurice stood up to look down into that area. There were other drooped pagodas there, and some just lying on the ground. Three intact pagodas were singing to the hurt ones-he could hear the music softly. They were trying to heal their friends.</p>

<p><q>Get well, Ti Ti Ting!</q> Maurice said. <q>I know what it feels like to be sick. Get well!</q></p>

<p>Ti Ti Ting stood a little straighter and looked at Maurice. He seemed to be trying to tell him something, but Maurice could not hear what it was. Maurice reached out and touched Ti Ti Ting softly, then he hurried off to scatter more salt.</p>

<p>When he ran out of salt, he filled the bag with slugs and emptied it into the river then went back for more. He dropped unsalted slugs onto the salted ones, trying to get twice the use for the salt. He worked for hours, it seemed. The night grew darker, as it does before dawn. All the wind hushed. Maurice and the pagodas had cleared the slugs from the depression between the second and third mounds. Pagodas were manning their wall again. Others were securing the second mound and the wall there, and some were advancing even on the first mound.</p>

<p>Maurice could do no more. His arms ached, and his legs ached so badly that he had to sit down. He lay back for a moment to slow the blood dripping from his nose.</p>

<p>He watched the pagodas. They were still fighting hard to save themselves, but Maurice thought they had the advantage now. He and his grandmother's salt had changed the outcome of the battle.</p>

<p>He knew he should be getting back before someone missed him. <q>Good-bye, pagodas!</q> he said. <q>Good-bye, Ti Ti Ting. I'll try to come back before we leave for Paris.</q></p>

<p>None of them noticed him now. They were all too busy. Maurice was tired and cold, but he decided to lay there just a little longer till maybe his legs felt a little better. He was not sure he could walk all the way home just then.</p>

<br/>

<p>He woke with a start. Pagodas stood all around him, singing. There were more pagodas around him than he had ever seen. Ti Ti Ting stood right by his head.</p>

<p>The battle was over.</p>

<p>Maurice felt so at peace surrounded by the music he did not move. His head felt different somehow, clearer, not feverish. His nose had stopped bleeding.</p>

<p>A soft morning light burnished the glen and the mounds. A gentle breeze blew east off the bay. Yet it was so quiet he could hear the pagodas' music clearly.</p>

<p>They were singing for him.</p>

<p>Maurice closed his eyes. His legs did not ache. His nose throbbed, but it was not bleeding. He felt certain his body was healed. <q>Thank you,</q> he whispered.</p>

<p>It seemed that Ti Ti Ting was singing thank you in return.</p>

<br/>

<p>He woke again when he heard his mother and father calling his name. It was full light now. The pagodas had moved away. He could see them on all the mounds, even the first. He saw only dead slugs. He stepped carefully away from the mounds and walked steadily up to the pottery steps. He lay there waiting for his parents.</p>

<p><q>Maurice!</q> he heard his mother call. <q>Maurice?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm here, Mother,</q> he called.</p>

<p>He saw her running up the path. Soon he was in her arms, and Papa and Grandmother were there, too.</p>

<p><q>I'm better now,</q> Maurice said. <q>The pagodas sang to me last night. I went to sleep hearing them sing after we defeated the slugs, and I feel better now. They helped me.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, Maurice,</q> his mother said.</p>

<br/>

<p>But Maurice was right. He was still weak, and he had to work to regain his strength, but his nose did not bleed again. His legs did not bruise abnormally again. The fevers did not return. His grandmother thought her priests and their blessings had done it. His mother thought it had been all their tender care, and maybe a miracle. His father did not care how it had happened, just that his son was well again.</p>

<p>On their last day in Ciboure before returning to Paris, they all picnicked by the river. They let Maurice walk alone up to the old pottery.</p>

<p>He went straight to the mounds. The pagodas were there. None of them sank down at his approach. He looked around for Ti Ti Ting and found him standing guard on the repaired wall. Maurice knelt in front of him. He opened his tin soldier pouch and scattered the broken pieces of a dish his grandmother had dropped the day before. <q>I brought you presents,</q> he said.</p>

<p>The pagodas all gathered around. He set down a big bag of salt in front of them. <q>You know how to use this,</q> he said. <q>I'll bring you more next summer when we visit Grandmother.</q></p>

<p>The pagodas started singing. Maurice listened. He tried to catch a melody he could remember and hum, but it was all too different. The music seemed so foreign to him then. But Ti Ti Ting seemed insistent about something. Maurice leaned down to listen to what he might be saying. Maurice listened and listened-and suddenly he understood. Ti Ti Ting was telling Maurice that he would understand their music in time, that Maurice would write down some of it and present it to the world. They knew this about him: that Maurice would become a composer who would give beautiful music to a world that needed beauty.</p>

<p>Maurice sat up and laughed. <q>Oh, I hope so!</q> he said. <q>That would be such fun.</q></p>

<p>They said their good-byes, and Maurice made his way up the path. He met his father standing in shadows under the trees at the edge of the glen. He had an odd look on his face. Maurice just smiled and took his father's hand as they walked back to the others.</p>

<br/>

<p>In the coming years, Maurice always took salt and bits of broken china to the pagodas when they visited his grandmother. His illness never returned, and he grew into a strong young man. In time, all the world knew the name <q>Maurice Ravel</q> because of the beautiful music he wrote. He remembered what Ti Ti Ting had told him, and when he could finally make sense of it, he used some of the pagoda music in his Mother Goose Suite and a ballet before that and a set of piano pieces before that. The music delights audiences to this day. Maurice hoped it might heal some of them.</p>

<p>One day, a letter arrived from his grandmother. She told him that a corporation had bought the ruined pottery with plans of establishing a shoe factory on the site. Maurice rushed to Ciboure. The men loading his trunks onto the train wondered why he took so many empty trunks, but when he returned they were not so empty. Maurice bought a house in the forest of Rambouillet outside Paris, and over time he purchased all the land around it. The neighbors wondered at the many happy parties the Ravel family held among the trees there, at all the tinkling lights and the Chinese-sounding music.</p>

<p>Maurice always donated to foundations helping children with leukemia. From time to time he let his friends bring their children to his estate, if they were sick. They'd take them home well again weeks later.</p>

<p>The Ravels keep that forest estate to this day. It is a wild, brambly place with secret, flowered glens. No one will ever build on that land.</p>

<p>Other things have built there.</p>
