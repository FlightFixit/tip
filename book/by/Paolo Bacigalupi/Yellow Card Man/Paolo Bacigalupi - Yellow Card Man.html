<h1>Yellow Card Man</h1>
<h2>by Paolo Bacigalupi</h2>

<p>Paolo Bacigalupi recently won the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award for his short story <q>The Calorie Man,</q> and that same tale is, at this writing, a finalist for the 2006 Hugo Award. The author has a website at windupstories.com. He tells us the pitiless future of the <q>Yellow Card Man</q> was <q>an outgrowth from an aborted novel.</q> In his latest story, Tranh, who began existence as one of the book&rsquo;s supporting characters, must use any means available to survive in this ruthless and precarious future.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Machetes gleam on the warehouse floor, reflecting a red conflagration of jute and tamarind and kink-springs. They&rsquo;re all around now. The men with their green headbands and their slogans and their wet wet blades. Their calls echo in the warehouse and on the street. Number one son is already gone. Jade Blossom he cannot find, no matter how many times he treadles her phone number. His daughters&rsquo; faces have been split wide like blister rust durians.</p>

<p>More fires blaze. Black smoke roils around him. He runs through his warehouse offices, past computers with teak cases and iron treadles and past piles of ash where his clerks burned files through the night, obliterating the names of people who aided the Tri-Clipper.</p>

<p>He runs, choking on heat and smoke. In his own gracious office he dashes to the shutters and fumbles with their brass catches. He slams his shoulder against those blue shutters while the warehouse burns and brown-skinned men boil through the door and swing their slick red knives &hellip;</p>

<p>Tranh wakes, gasping.</p>

<p>Sharp concrete edges jam against the knuckles of his spine. A salt-slick thigh smothers his face. He shoves away the stranger&rsquo;s leg. Sweat-sheened skin glimmers in the blackness, impressionistic markers for the bodies that shift and shove all around him. They fart and groan and turn, flesh on flesh, bone against bone, the living and the heat-smothered dead all together.</p>

<p>A man coughs. Moist lungs and spittle gust against Tranh&rsquo;s face. His spine and belly stick to the naked sweating flesh of the strangers around him. Claustrophobia rises. He forces it down. Forces himself to lie still, to breathe slowly, deeply, despite the heat. To taste the sweltering darkness with all the paranoia of a survivor&rsquo;s mind. He is awake while others sleep. He is alive while others are long dead. He forces himself to lie still, and listen.</p>

<p>Bicycle bells are ringing. Down below and far away, ten thousand bodies below, a lifetime away, bicycle bells chime. He claws himself out of the mass of tangled humanity, dragging his hemp sack of possessions with him. He is late. Of all the days he could be late, this is the worst possible one. He slings the bag over a bony shoulder and feels his way down the stairs, finding his footing in the cascade of sleeping flesh. He slides his sandals between families, lovers, and crouching hungry ghosts, praying that he will not slip and break an old man&rsquo;s bone. Step, feel, step, feel.</p>

<p>A curse rises from the mass. Bodies shift and roll. He steadies himself on a landing amongst the privileged who lie flat, then wades on. Downward, ever downward, round more turnings of the stair, wading down through the carpet of his countrymen. Step. Feel. Step. Feel. Another turn. A hint of gray light glimmers far below. Fresh air kisses his face, caresses his body. The waterfall of anonymous flesh resolves into individuals, men and women sprawled across one another, pillowed on hard concrete, propped on the slant of the windowless stair. Gray light turns gold. The tinkle of bicycle bells comes louder now, clear like the ring of cibiscosis chimes.</p>

<p>Tranh spills out of the high-rise and into a crowd of congee sellers, hemp weavers, and potato carts. He puts his hands on his knees and gasps, sucking in swirling dust and trampled street dung, grateful for every breath as sweat pours off his body. Salt jewels fall from the tip of his nose, spatter the red paving stones of the sidewalk with his moisture. Heat kills men. Kills old men. But he is out of the oven; he has not been cooked again, despite the blast furnace of the dry season.</p>

<p>Bicycles and their ringing bells flow past like schools of carp, commuters already on their way to work. Behind him the high-rise looms, forty stories of heat and vines and mold. A vertical ruin of broken windows and pillaged apartments. A remnant glory from the old energy Expansion now become a heated tropic coffin without air conditioning or electricity to protect it from the glaze of the equatorial sun. Bangkok keeps its refugees in the pale blue sky, and wishes they would stay there. And yet he has emerged alive; despite the Dung Lord, despite the white shirts, despite old age, he has once again clawed his way down from the heavens.</p>

<p>Tranh straightens. Men stir woks of noodles and pull steamers of <i>baozi</i> from their bamboo rounds. Gray high-protein U-Tex rice gruel fills the air with the scents of rotting fish and fatty acid oils. Tranh&rsquo;s stomach knots with hunger and a pasty saliva coats his mouth, all that his dehydrated body can summon at the scent of food. Devil cats swirl around the vendors&rsquo; legs like sharks, hoping for morsels to drop, hoping for theft opportunities. Their shimmering chameleon-like forms flit and flicker, showing calico and Siamese and orange tabby markings before fading against the backdrop of concrete and crowding hungry people that they brush against. The woks burn hard and bright with green-tinged methane, giving off new scents as rice noodles splash into hot oil. Tranh forces himself to turn away.</p>

<p>He shoves through the press, dragging his hemp bag along with him, ignoring who it hits and who shouts after him. Incident victims crouch in the doorways, waving severed limbs and begging from others who have a little more. Men squat on tea stools and watch the day&rsquo;s swelter build as they smoke tiny rolled cigarettes of scavenged gold leaf tobacco and share them from lip to lip. Women converse in knots, nervously fingering yellow cards as they wait for white shirts to appear and stamp their renewals.</p>

<p>Yellow card people as far as the eye can see: an entire race of people, fled to the great Thai Kingdom from Malaya where they were suddenly unwelcome. A fat clot of refugees placed under the authority of the Environment Ministry&rsquo;s white shirts as if they were nothing but another invasive species to be managed, like cibiscosis, blister rust, and genehack weevil. Yellow cards, yellow men. <i>Huang ren</i> all around, and Tranh is late for his one opportunity to climb out of their mass. One opportunity in all his months as a yellow card Chinese refugee. And now he is late. He squeezes past a rat seller, swallowing another rush of saliva at the scent of roasted flesh, and rushes down an alley to the water pump. He stops short.</p>

<p>Ten others stand in line before him: old men, young women, mothers, boys.</p>

<p>He slumps. He wants to rage at the setback. If he had the energy&mdash;if he had eaten well yesterday or the day before or even the day before that he would scream, would throw his hemp bag on the street and stamp on it until it turned to dust&mdash;but his calories are too few. It is just another opportunity squandered, thanks to the ill luck of the stairwells. He should have given the last of his baht to the Dung Lord and rented body-space in an apartment with windows facing east so that he could see the rising sun, and wake early.</p>

<p>But he was cheap. Cheap with his money. Cheap with his future. How many times did he tell his sons that spending money to make more money was perfectly acceptable? But the timid yellow card refugee that he has become counseled him to save his baht. Like an ignorant peasant mouse he clutched his cash to himself and slept in pitch-black stairwells. He should have stood like a tiger and braved the night curfew and the ministry&rsquo;s white shirts and their black batons&hellip;. And now he is late and reeks of the stairwells and stands behind ten others, all of whom must drink and fill a bucket and brush their teeth with the brown water of the Chao Phraya River.</p>

<p>There was a time when he demanded punctuality of his employees, of his wife, of his sons and concubines, but it was when he owned a spring-wound wristwatch and could gaze at its steady sweep of minutes and hours. Every so often, he could wind its tiny spring, and listen to it tick, and lash his sons for their lazy attitudes. He has become old and slow and stupid or he would have foreseen this. Just as he should have foreseen the rising militancy of the Green Headbands. When did his mind become so slack?</p>

<p>One by one, the other refugees finish their ablutions. A mother with gap teeth and blooms of gray <i>fa&rsquo; gan</i> fringe behind her ears tops her bucket, and Tranh slips forward.</p>

<p>He has no bucket. Just the bag. The precious bag. He hangs it beside the pump and wraps his sarong more tightly around his hollow hips before he squats under the pump head. With a bony arm he yanks the pump&rsquo;s handle. Ripe brown water gushes over him. The river&rsquo;s blessing. His skin droops off his body with the weight of the water, sagging like the flesh of a shaved cat. He opens his mouth and drinks the gritty water, rubs his teeth with a finger, wondering what protozoa he may swallow. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. He trusts luck, now. It&rsquo;s all he has.</p>

<p>Children watch him bathe his old body while their mothers scavenge through PurCal mango peels and Red Star tamarind hulls hoping to find some bit of fruit not tainted with cibiscosis.111mt.6&hellip;. Or is it 111mt.7? Or mt.8? There was a time when he knew all the bio-engineered plagues that ailed them. Knew when a crop was about to fail, and whether new seedstock had been ripped. Profited from the knowledge by filling his clipper ships with the right seeds and produce. But that was a lifetime ago.</p>

<p>His hands are shaking as he opens his bag and pulls out his clothes. Is it old age or excitement that makes him tremble? Clean clothes. Good clothes. A rich man&rsquo;s white linen suit.</p>

<p>The clothes were not his, but now they are, and he has kept them safe. Safe for this opportunity, even when he desperately wanted to sell them for cash or wear them as his other clothes turned to rags. He drags the trousers up his bony legs, stepping out of his sandals and balancing one foot at a time. He begins buttoning the shirt, hurrying his fingers as a voice in his head reminds him that time is slipping away.</p>

<p><q>Selling those clothes? Going to parade them around until someone with meat on his bones buys them off you?</q></p>

<p>Tranh glances up&mdash;he shouldn&rsquo;t need to look; he should know the voice&mdash;and yet he looks anyway. He can&rsquo;t help himself. Once he was a tiger. Now he is nothing but a frightened little mouse who jumps and twitches at every hint of danger. And there it is: Ma. Standing before him, beaming. Fat and beaming. As vital as a wolf.</p>

<p>Ma grins. <q>You look like a wire-frame mannequin at Palawan Plaza.</q></p>

<p><q>I wouldn&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t afford to shop there.</q> Tranh keeps putting on his clothes.</p>

<p><q>Those are nice enough to come from Palawan. How did you get them?</q></p>

<p>Tranh doesn&rsquo;t answer.</p>

<p><q>Who are you fooling? Those clothes were made for a man a thousand times your size.</q></p>

<p><q>We can&rsquo;t all be fat and lucky.</q> Tranh&rsquo;s voice comes out as a whisper. Did he always whisper? Was he always such a rattletrap corpse whispering and sighing at every threat? He doesn&rsquo;t think so. But it&rsquo;s hard for him to remember what a tiger should sound like. He tries again, steadying his voice. <q>We can&rsquo;t all be as lucky as Ma Ping who lives on the top floors with the Dung King himself.</q> His words still come out like reeds shushing against concrete.</p>

<p><q>Lucky?</q> Ma laughs. So young. So pleased with himself. <q>I earn my fate. Isn&rsquo;t that what you always used to tell me? That luck has nothing to do with success? That men make their own luck?</q> He laughs again. <q>And now look at you.</q></p>

<p>Tranh grits his teeth. <q>Better men than you have fallen.</q> Still the awful timid whisper.</p>

<p><q>And better men than you are on the rise.</q> Ma&rsquo;s fingers dart to his wrist. They stroke a wristwatch, a fine chronograph, ancient, gold and diamonds&mdash;Rolex. From an earlier time. A different place. A different world. Tranh stares stupidly, like a hypnotized snake. He can&rsquo;t tear his eyes away.</p>

<p>Ma smiles lazily. <q>You like it? I found it in an antique shop near Wat Rajapradit. It seemed familiar.</q></p>

<p>Tranh&rsquo;s anger rises. He starts to reply, then shakes his head and says nothing. Time is passing. He fumbles with his final buttons, pulls on the coat and runs his fingers through the last surviving strands of his lank gray hair. If he had a comb &hellip; He grimaces. It is stupid to wish. The clothes are enough. They have to be.</p>

<p>Ma laughs. <q>Now you look like a Big Name.</q></p>

<p><i>Ignore him</i>, says the voice inside Tranh&rsquo;s head. Tranh pulls his last paltry baht out of his hemp bag&mdash;the money he saved by sleeping in the stairwells, and which has now made him so late&mdash;and shoves it into his pockets.</p>

<p><q>You seem rushed. Do you have an appointment somewhere?</q></p>

<p>Tranh shoves past, trying not to flinch as he squeezes around Ma&rsquo;s bulk.</p>

<p>Ma calls after him, laughing. <q>Where are you headed, Mr. Big Name? Mr. Three Prosperities! Do you have some intelligence you&rsquo;d like to share with the rest of us?</q></p>

<p>Others look up at the shout: hungry yellow card faces, hungry yellow card mouths. Yellow card people as far as the eye can see, and all of them looking at him now. Incident survivors. Men. Women. Children. Knowing him, now. Recognizing his legend. With a change of clothing and a single shout he has risen from obscurity. Their mocking calls pour down like a monsoon rain:</p>

<p><q><i>Wei</i>! Mr. Three Prosperities! Nice shirt!</q></p>

<p><q>Share a smoke, Mr. Big Name!</q></p>

<p><q>Where are you going so fast all dressed up?</q></p>

<p><q>Getting married?</q></p>

<p><q>Getting a tenth wife?</q></p>

<p><q>Got a job?</q></p>

<p><q>Mr. Big Name! Got a job for me?</q></p>

<p><q>Where you going? Maybe we should all follow Old Multinational!</q></p>

<p>Tranh&rsquo;s neck prickles. He shakes off the fear. Even if they follow it will be too late for them to take advantage. For the first time in half a year, the advantage of skills and knowledge are on his side. Now there is only time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He jogs through Bangkok&rsquo;s morning press as bicycles and cycle rickshaws and spring-wound scooters stream past. Sweat drenches him. It soaks his good shirt, damps even his jacket. He takes it off and slings it over an arm. His gray hair clings to his egg-bald liver-spotted skull, waterlogged. He pauses every other block to walk and recover his breath as his shins begin to ache and his breath comes in gasps and his old man&rsquo;s heart hammers in his chest.</p>

<p>He should spend his baht on a cycle rickshaw but he can&rsquo;t make himself do it. He is late. But perhaps he is too late? And if he is too late, the extra baht will be wasted and he will starve tonight. But then, what good is a suit soaked with sweat?</p>

<p>Clothes make the man, he told his sons; the first impression is the most important. Start well, and you start ahead. Of course you can win someone with your skills and your knowledge but people are animals first. Look good. Smell good. Satisfy their first senses. Then when they are well disposed toward you, make your proposal.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that why he beat Second Son when he came home with a red tattoo of a tiger on his shoulder, as though he was some calorie gangster? Isn&rsquo;t that why he paid a tooth doctor to twist even his daughters&rsquo; teeth with cultured bamboo and rubber curves from Singapore so that they were as straight as razors?</p>

<p><i>And isn&rsquo;t that why the Green Headbands in Malaya hated us Chinese? Because we looked so good? Because we looked so rich? Because we spoke so well and worked so hard when they were lazy and we sweated every day?</i></p>

<p>Tranh watches a pack of spring-wound scooters flit past, all of them Thai-Chinese manufactured. Such clever fast things&mdash;a megajoule kink-spring and a flywheel, pedals and friction brakes to regather kinetic energy. And all their factories owned 100 percent by Chiu Chow Chinese. And yet no Chiu Chow blood runs in the gutters of this country. These Chiu Chow Chinese are loved, despite the fact that they came to the Thai Kingdom as <i>farang</i>.</p>

<p><i>If we had assimilated in Malaya like the Chiu Chow did here, would we have survived?</i></p>

<p>Tranh shakes his head at the thought. It would have been impossible. His clan would have had to convert to Islam as well, and forsake all their ancestors in Hell. It would have been impossible. Perhaps it was his people&rsquo;s karma to be destroyed. To stand tall and dominate the cities of Penang and Malacca and all the western coast of the Malayan Peninsula for a brief while, and then to die.</p>

<p>Clothes make the man. Or kill him. Tranh understands this, finally. A white tailored suit from Hwang Brothers is nothing so much as a target. An antique piece of gold mechanization swinging on your wrist is nothing if not bait. Tranh wonders if his sons&rsquo; perfect teeth still lie in the ashes of Three Prosperities&rsquo; warehouses, if their lovely timepieces now attract sharks and crabs in the holds of his scuttled clipper ships.</p>

<p>He should have known. Should have seen the rising tide of bloodthirsty subsects and intensifying nationalism. Just as the man he followed two months ago should have known that fine clothes were no protection. A man in good clothes, a yellow card to boot, should have known that he was nothing but a bit of bloodied bait before a Komodo lizard. At least the stupid melon didn&rsquo;t bleed on his fancy clothes when the white shirts were done with him. That one had no habit of survival. He forgot that he was no longer a Big Name.</p>

<p>But Tranh is learning. As he once learned tides and depth charts, markets and bio-engineered plagues, profit maximization and how to balance the dragon&rsquo;s gate, he now learns from the devil cats who molt and fade from sight, who flee their hunters at the first sign of danger. He learns from the crows and kites who live so well on scavenge. These are the animals he must emulate. He must discard the reflexes of a tiger. There are no tigers except in zoos. A tiger is always hunted and killed. But a small animal, a scavenging animal, has a chance to strip the bones of a tiger and walk away with the last Hwang Brothers suit that will ever cross the border from Malaya. With the Hwang clan all dead and the Hwang patterns all burned, nothing is left except memories and antiques, and one scavenging old man who knows the power and the peril of good appearance.</p>

<p>An empty cycle rickshaw coasts past. The rickshaw man looks back at Tranh, eyes questioning, attracted by the Hwang Brothers fabrics that flap off Tranh&rsquo;s skinny frame. Tranh raises a tentative hand. The cycle rickshaw slows.</p>

<p>Is it a good risk? To spend his last security so frivolously?</p>

<p>There was the time when he sent clipper fleets across the ocean to Chennai with great stinking loads of durians because he guessed that the Indians had not had time to plant resistant crop strains before the new blister rust mutations swept over them. A time when he bought black tea and sandalwood from the river men on the chance that he could sell it in the South. Now he can&rsquo;t decide if he should ride or walk. What a pale man he has become! Sometimes he wonders if he is actually a hungry ghost, trapped between worlds and unable to escape one way or the other.</p>

<p>The cycle rickshaw coasts ahead, the rider&rsquo;s blue jersey shimmering in the tropic sun, waiting for a decision. Tranh waves him away. The rickshaw man stands on his pedals, sandals flapping against calloused heels, and accelerates.</p>

<p>Panic seizes Tranh. He raises his hand again, chases after the rickshaw. <q>Wait!</q> His voice comes out as a whisper.</p>

<p>The rickshaw slips into traffic, joining bicycles and the massive shambling shapes of elephantine megodonts. Tranh lets his hand fall, obscurely grateful that the rickshaw man hasn&rsquo;t heard, that the decision of spending his last baht has been made by some force larger than himself.</p>

<p>All around him, the morning press flows. Hundreds of children in their sailor suit uniforms stream through school gates. Saffron-robed monks stroll under the shade of wide black umbrellas. A man with a conical bamboo hat watches him and then mutters quietly to his friend. They both study him. A trickle of fear runs up Tranh&rsquo;s spine.</p>

<p>They are all around him, as they were in Malacca. In his own mind, he calls them foreigners, <i>farang</i>. And yet it is he who is the foreigner here. The creature that doesn&rsquo;t belong. And they know it. The women hanging sarongs on the wires of their balconies, the men sitting barefoot while they drink sugared coffee. The fish sellers and curry men. They all know it, and Tranh can barely control his terror.</p>

<p>Bangkok is not Malacca, he tells himself. Bangkok is not Penang. We have no wives, or gold wristwatches with diamonds, or clipper fleets to steal anymore. Ask the snakeheads who abandoned me in the leech jungles of the border. They have all my wealth. I have nothing. I am no tiger. I am safe.</p>

<p>For a few seconds he believes it. But then a teak-skinned boy chops the top off a coconut with a rusty machete and offers it to Tranh with a smile and it&rsquo;s all Tranh can do not to scream and run.</p>

<p>Bangkok is not Malacca. They will not burn your warehouses or slash your clerks into chunks of shark bait. He wipes sweat off his face. Perhaps he should have waited to wear the suit. It draws too much attention. There are too many people looking at him. Better to fade like a devil cat and slink across the city in safe anonymity, instead of strutting around like a peacock.</p>

<p>Slowly the streets change from palm-lined boulevards to the open wastelands of the new foreigners&rsquo; quarter. Tranh hurries toward the river, heading deeper into the manufacturing empire of white <i>farang</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gweilo, yang guizi, farang.</i> So many words in so many languages for these translucent-skinned sweating monkeys. Two generations ago when the petroleum ran out and the <i>gweilo</i> factories shut down, everyone assumed they were gone for good. And now they are back. The monsters of the past returned, with new toys and new technologies. The nightmares his mother threatened him with, invading Asiatic coasts. Demons truly; never dead.</p>

<p>And he goes to worship them: the ilk of AgriGen and PurCal with their monopolies on U-Tex rice and Total Nutrient Wheat; the blood-brothers of the bio-engineers who generipped devil cats from storybook inspiration and set them loose in the world to breed and breed and breed; the sponsors of the Intellectual Property Police who used to board his clipper fleets in search of IP infringements, hunting like wolves for unstamped calories and gene-ripped grains as though their engineered plagues of cibiscosis and blister rust weren&rsquo;t enough to keep their profits high&hellip;.</p>

<p>Ahead of him, a crowd has formed. Tranh frowns. He starts to run, then forces himself back to a walk. Better not to waste his calories, now. A line has already formed in front of the foreign devil Tennyson Brothers&rsquo; factory. It stretches almost a <i>li,</i> snaking around the corner, past the bicycle gear logo in the wrought iron gate of Sukhumvit Research Corporation, past the intertwined dragons of PurCal East Asia, and past Mishimoto &amp; Co., the clever Japanese fluid dynamics company that Tranh once sourced his clipper designs from.</p>

<p>Mishimoto is full of windup import workers, they say. Full of illegal gene-ripped bodies that walk and talk and totter about in their herky-jerky way&mdash;and take rice from real men&rsquo;s bowls. Creatures with as many as eight arms like the Hindu gods, creatures with no legs so they cannot run away, creatures with eyes as large as teacups that can only see a bare few feet ahead of them but inspect everything with enormous magnified curiosity. But no one can see inside, and if the Environment Ministry&rsquo;s white shirts know, then the clever Japanese are paying them well to ignore their crimes against biology and religion. It is perhaps the only thing a good Buddhist and a good Muslim and even the <i>farang</i> Grahamite Christians can agree on: windups have no souls.</p>

<p>When Tranh bought Mishimoto&rsquo;s clipper ships so long ago, he didn&rsquo;t care. Now he wonders if behind their high gates, windup monstrosities labor while yellow cards stand outside and beg.</p>

<p>Tranh trudges down the line. Policemen with clubs and spring guns patrol the hopefuls, making jokes about <i>farang</i> who wish to work for <i>farang.</i> Heat beats down, merciless on the men lined up before the gate.</p>

<p><q>Wah! You look like a pretty bird with those clothes.</q></p>

<p>Tranh starts. Li Shen and Hu Laoshi and Lao Xia stand in the line, clustered together. A trio of old men as pathetic as himself. Hu waves a newly rolled cigarette in invitation, motioning him to join them. Tranh nearly shakes at the sight of the tobacco, but forces himself to refuse it. Three times Hu offers, and finally Tranh allows himself to accept, grateful that Hu is in earnest, and wondering where Hu has found this sudden wealth. But then, Hu has a little more strength than the rest of them. A cart man earns more if he works as fast as Hu.</p>

<p>Tranh wipes the sweat off his brow. <q>A lot of applicants.</q></p>

<p>They all laugh at Tranh&rsquo;s dismay.</p>

<p>Hu lights the cigarette for Tranh. <q>You thought you knew a secret, maybe?</q></p>

<p>Tranh shrugs and draws deeply, passes the cigarette to Lao Xia. <q>A rumor. Potato God said his elder brother&rsquo;s son had a promotion. I thought there might be a niche down below, in the slot the nephew left behind.</q></p>

<p>Hu grins. <q>That&rsquo;s where I heard it, too. <q>Eee. He&rsquo;ll be rich. Manage fifteen clerks. Eee! He&rsquo;ll be rich.</q> I thought I might be one of the fifteen.</q></p>

<p><q>At least the rumor was true,</q> Lao Xia says. <q>And not just Potato God&rsquo;s nephew promoted, either.</q> He scratches the back of his head, a convulsive movement like a dog fighting fleas. <i>Fa&rsquo; gan&rsquo;s</i> gray fringe stains the crooks of his elbows and peeps from the sweaty pockets behind his ears where his hair has receded. He sometimes jokes about it: nothing a little money can&rsquo;t fix. A good joke. But today he is scratching and the skin behind his ears is cracked and raw. He notices everyone watching and yanks his hand down. He grimaces and passes the cigarette to Li Shen.</p>

<p><q>How many positions?</q> Tranh asks.</p>

<p><q>Three. Three clerks.</q></p>

<p>Tranh grimaces. <q>My lucky number.</q></p>

<p>Li Shen peers down the line with his bottle-thick glasses. <q>Too many of us, I think, even if your lucky number is 555.</q></p>

<p>Lao Xia laughs. <q>Amongst the four of us, there are already too many.</q> He taps the man standing in line just ahead of them. <q>Uncle. What was your profession before?</q></p>

<p>The stranger looks back, surprised. He was a distinguished gentleman, once, by his scholar&rsquo;s collar, by his fine leather shoes now scarred and blackened with scavenged charcoal. <q>I taught physics.</q></p>

<p>Lao Xia nods. <q>You see? We&rsquo;re all overqualified. I oversaw a rubber plantation. Our own professor has degrees in fluid dynamics and materials design. Hu was a fine doctor. And then there is our friend of the Three Prosperities. Not a trading company at all. More like a multi-national.</q> He tastes the words. Says them again, <q>Multi-national.</q> A strange, powerful, seductive sound.</p>

<p>Tranh ducks his head, embarrassed. <q>You&rsquo;re too kind.</q></p>

<p><i><q>Fang pi.</q></i> Hu takes a drag on his cigarette, keeps it moving. <q>You were the richest of us all. And now here we are, old men scrambling for young men&rsquo;s jobs. Every one of us ten thousand times overqualified.</q></p>

<p>The man behind them interjects, <q>I was executive legal counsel for Standard &amp; Commerce.</q></p>

<p>Lao Xia makes a face. <q>Who cares, dog fucker? You&rsquo;re nothing now.</q></p>

<p>The banking lawyer turns away, affronted. Lao Xia grins, sucks hard on the hand-rolled cigarette and passes it again to Tranh. Hu nudges Tranh&rsquo;s elbow as he starts to take a puff. <q>Look! There goes old Ma.</q></p>

<p>Tranh looks over, exhales smoke sharply. For a moment he thinks Ma has followed him, but no. It is just coincidence. They are in the <i>farang</i> factory district. Ma works for the foreign devils, balancing their books. A kink-spring company. Springlife. Yes, Springlife. It is natural that Ma should be here, comfortably riding to work behind a sweating cycle-rickshaw man.</p>

<p><q>Ma Ping,</q> Li Shen says. <q>I heard he&rsquo;s living on the top floor now. Up there with the Dung Lord himself.</q></p>

<p>Tranh scowls. <q>I fired him, once. Ten thousand years ago. Lazy and an embezzler.</q></p>

<p><q>He&rsquo;s so fat.</q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;ve seen his wife,</q> Hu says. <q>And his sons. They both have fat on them. They eat meat every night. The boys are fatter than fat. Full of U-Tex proteins.</q></p>

<p><q>You&rsquo;re exaggerating.</q></p>

<p><q>Fatter than us.</q></p>

<p>Lao Xia scratches a rib. <q>Bamboo is fatter than you.</q></p>

<p>Tranh watches Ma Ping open a factory door and slip inside. The past is past. Dwelling on the past is madness. There is nothing for him there. There are no wristwatches, no concubines, no opium pipes or jade sculptures of Quan Yin&rsquo;s merciful form. There are no pretty clipper ships slicing into port with fortunes in their holds. He shakes his head and offers the nearly spent cigarette to Hu so that he can recover the last tobacco for later use. There is nothing for him in the past. Ma is in the past. Three Prosperities Trading Company is the past. The sooner he remembers this, the sooner he will climb out of this awful hole.</p>

<p>From behind him, a man calls out, <q><i>Wei</i>! Baldy! When did you cut the line? Go to the back! You line up, like the rest of us!</q></p>

<p><q>Line up?</q> Lao Xia shouts back. <q>Don&rsquo;t be stupid!</q> He waves at the line ahead. <q>How many hundreds are ahead of us? It won&rsquo;t make any difference where he stands.</q></p>

<p>Others begin to attend the man&rsquo;s complaint. Complain as well. <q>Line up! <i>Pai dui! Pai dui!</i></q> The disturbance increases and police start down the line, casually swinging their batons. They aren&rsquo;t white shirts, but they have no love for hungry yellow cards.</p>

<p>Tranh makes placating motions to the crowd and Lao Xia. <q>Of course. Of course. I&rsquo;ll line up. It&rsquo;s of no consequence.</q> He makes his farewells and plods his way down the winding yellow card snake, seeking its distant tail.</p>

<p>Everyone is dismissed long before he reaches it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A scavenging night. A starving night. Tranh hunts through dark alleys, avoiding the vertical prison heat of the towers. Devil cats seethe and scatter ahead of him in rippling waves. The lights of the methane lamps flicker, burn low and snuff themselves, blackening the city. Hot velvet darkness fetid with rotting fruit swaddles him. The heavy humid air sags. Still sweltering darkness. Empty market stalls. On a street corner, theater men turn in stylized cadences to stories of Ravana. On a thoroughfare, swingshift megodonts shuffle homeward like gray mountains, their massed shadows led by the gold trim glitter of union handlers.</p>

<p>In the alleys, children with bright silver knives hunt unwary yellow cards and drunken Thais, but Tranh is wise to their feral ways. A year ago, he would not have seen them, but he has the paranoid&rsquo;s gift of survival now. Creatures like them are no worse than sharks: easy to predict, easy to avoid. It is not these obviously feral hunters who churn Tranh&rsquo;s guts with fear, it is the chameleons, the everyday people who work and shop and smile and <i>wai</i> so pleasantly&mdash;and riot without warning&mdash;who terrify Tranh.</p>

<p>He picks through the trash heaps, fighting devil cats for signs of food, wishing he was fast enough to catch and kill one of those nearly invisible felines. Picking up discarded mangos, studying them carefully with his old man&rsquo;s eyes, holding them close and then far away, sniffing at them, feeling their blister rusted exteriors and then tossing them aside when they show red mottle in their guts. Some of them still smell good, but even crows won&rsquo;t accept such a taint. They would eagerly peck apart a bloated corpse, but they will not feed on blister rust.</p>

<p>Down the street, the Dung Lord&rsquo;s lackeys shovel the day&rsquo;s animal leavings into sacks and throw them into tricycle carriers: the night harvest. They watch him suspiciously. Tranh keeps his eyes averted, avoiding challenge, and scuffles on. He has nothing to cook on an illegally stolen shit fire anyway, and nowhere to sell manure on the black market. The Dung Lord&rsquo;s monopoly is too strong. Tranh wonders how it might be to find a place in the dung shovelers&rsquo; union, to know that his survival was guaranteed feeding the composters of Bangkok&rsquo;s methane reclamation plants. But it is an opium dream; no yellow card can slither into that closed club.</p>

<p>Tranh lifts another mango and freezes. He bends low, squinting. Pushes aside broadsheet complaints against the Ministry of Trade and handbills calling for a new gold-sheathed River Wat. He pushes aside black slime banana peels and burrows into the garbage. Below it all, stained and torn but still legible, he finds a portion of what was once a great advertising board that perhaps stood over this marketplace:&mdash;<i>ogistics. Shipping. Tradin&mdash;</i>and behind the words, the glorious silhouette of Dawn Star: one part of Three Prosperities&rsquo; tri-clipper logo, running before the wind as fast and sleek as a shark: a high-tech image of palm-oil spun polymers and sails as sharp and white as a gull&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Tranh turns his face away, overcome. It&rsquo;s like unearthing a grave and finding himself within. His pride. His blindness. From a time when he thought he might compete with the foreign devils and become a shipping magnate. A Li Ka Shing or a reborn Richard Kuok for the New Expansion. Rebuild the pride of Nanyang Chinese shipping and trading. And here, like a slap in the face, a portion of his ego, buried in rot and blister rust and devil cat urine.</p>

<p>He searches around, pawing for more portions of the sign, wondering if anyone treadles a phone call to that old phone number, if the secretary whose wages he once paid is still at his desk, working for a new master, a native Malay perhaps, with impeccable pedigree and religion. Wondering if the few clippers he failed to scuttle still ply the seas and islands of the archipelago. He forces himself to stop his search. Even if he had the money he would not treadle that number. Would not waste the calories. Could not stand the loss again.</p>

<p>He straightens, scattering devil cats who have slunk close. There is nothing here in this market except rinds and unshoveled dung. He has wasted his calories once again. Even the cockroaches and the blood beetles have been eaten. If he searches for a dozen hours, he will still find nothing. Too many people have come before, picking at these bones.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three times he hides from white shirts as he makes his way home, three times ducking into shadows as they strut past. Cringing as they wander close, cursing his white linen suit that shows so clearly in darkness. By the third time, superstitious fear runs hot in his veins. His rich man&rsquo;s clothes seem to attract the patrols of the Environment Ministry, seem to hunger for the wearer&rsquo;s death. Black batons twirl from casual hands no more than inches away from his face. Spring guns glitter silver in the darkness. His hunters stand so close that he can count the wicked bladed disk cartridges in their jute bandoliers. A white shirt pauses and pisses in the alley where Tranh crouches, and only fails to see him because his partner stands on the street and wants to check the permits of the dung gatherers.</p>

<p>Each time, Tranh stifles his panicked urge to tear off his too-rich clothes and sink into safe anonymity. It is only a matter of time before the white shirts catch him. Before they swing their black clubs and make his Chinese skull a mash of blood and bone. Better to run naked through the hot night than strut like a peacock and die. And yet he cannot quite abandon the cursed suit. Is it pride? Is it stupidity? He keeps it though, even as its arrogant cut turns his bowels watery with fear.</p>

<p>By the time he reaches home, even the gas lights on the main thoroughfares of Sukhumvit Road and Rama IV are blackened. Outside the Dung Lord&rsquo;s tower, street stalls still burn woks for the few laborers lucky enough to have night work and curfew dispensations. Pork tallow candles flicker on the tables. Noodles splash into hot woks with a sizzle. White shirts stroll past, their eyes on the seated yellow cards, ensuring that none of the foreigners brazenly sleep in the open air and sully the sidewalks with their snoring presence.</p>

<p>Tranh joins the protective loom of the towers, entering the nearly extra-territorial safety of the Dung Lord&rsquo;s influence. He stumbles toward the doorways and the swelter of the high rise, wondering how high he will be forced to climb before he can shove a niche for himself on the stairwells.</p>

<p><q>You didn&rsquo;t get the job, did you?</q></p>

<p>Tranh cringes at the voice. It&rsquo;s Ma Ping again, sitting at a sidewalk table, a bottle of Mekong whiskey beside his hand. His face is flushed with alcohol, as bright as a red paper lantern. Half-eaten plates of food lie strewn around his table. Enough to feed five others, easily.</p>

<p>Images of Ma war in Tranh&rsquo;s head: the young clerk he once sent packing for being too clever with an abacus, the man whose son is fat, the man who got out early, the man who begged to be rehired at Three Prosperities, the man who now struts around Bangkok with Tranh&rsquo;s last precious possession on his wrist&mdash;the one item that even the snakeheads didn&rsquo;t steal. Tranh thinks that truly fate is cruel, placing him in such proximity to one he once considered so far beneath him.</p>

<p>Despite his intention to show bravado, once again Tranh&rsquo;s words come out as a mousy whisper. <q>What do you care?</q></p>

<p>Ma shrugs, pours whiskey for himself. <q>I wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed you in the line, without that suit.</q> He nods at Tranh&rsquo;s sweat-damp clothing. <q>Good idea to dress up. Too far back in line, though.</q></p>

<p>Tranh wants to walk away, to ignore the arrogant whelp, but Ma&rsquo;s leavings of steamed bass and <i>laap</i> and U-Tex rice noodles lie tantalizingly close. He thinks he smells pork and can&rsquo;t help salivating. His gums ache for the idea that he could chew meat again and he wonders if his teeth would accept the awful luxury&hellip;.</p>

<p>Abruptly, Tranh realizes that he has been staring. That he has stood for some time, ogling the scraps of Ma&rsquo;s meal. And Ma is watching him. Tranh flushes and starts to turn away.</p>

<p>Ma says, <q>I didn&rsquo;t buy your watch to spite you, you know.</q></p>

<p>Tranh stops short. <q>Why then?</q></p>

<p>Ma&rsquo;s fingers stray to the gold and diamond bauble, then seem to catch themselves. He reaches for his whiskey glass instead. <q>I wanted a reminder.</q> He takes a swallow of liquor and sets the glass back amongst his piled plates with the deliberate care of a drunk. He grins sheepishly. His fingers are again stroking the watch, a guilty furtive movement. <q>I wanted a reminder. Against ego.</q></p>

<p>Tranh spits. <i><q>Fang pi.</q></i></p>

<p>Ma shakes his head vigorously. <q>No! It&rsquo;s true.</q> He pauses. <q>Anyone can fall. If the Three Prosperities can fall, then I can. I wanted to remember that.</q> He takes another pull on his whiskey. <q>You were right to fire me.</q></p>

<p>Tranh snorts. <q>You didn&rsquo;t think so then.</q></p>

<p><q>I was angry. I didn&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;d saved my life, then.</q> He shrugs. <q>I would never have left Malaya if you hadn&rsquo;t fired me. I would never have seen the Incident coming. I would have had too much invested in staying.</q> Abruptly, he pulls himself upright and motions for Tranh to join him. <q>Come. Have a drink. Have some food. I owe you that much. You saved my life. I&rsquo;ve repaid you poorly. Sit.</q></p>

<p>Tranh turns away. <q>I don&rsquo;t despise myself so much.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you love face so much that you can&rsquo;t take a man&rsquo;s food? Don&rsquo;t be stuck in your bones. I don&rsquo;t care if you hate me. Just take my food. Curse me later, when your belly is full.</q></p>

<p>Tranh tries to control his hunger, to force himself to walk away, but he can&rsquo;t. He knows men who might have enough face to starve before accepting Ma&rsquo;s scraps, but he isn&rsquo;t one of them. A lifetime ago, he might have been. But the humiliations of his new life have taught him much about who he really is. He has no sweet illusions now. He sits. Ma beams and pushes his half-eaten dishes across the table.</p>

<p>Tranh thinks he must have done something grave in a former life to merit this humiliation, but still he has to fight the urge to bury his hands in the oily food and eat with bare fingers. Finally, the owner of the sidewalk stall brings a pair of chopsticks for the noodles, and fork and spoon for the rest. Noodles and ground pork slide down his throat. He tries to chew but as soon as the food touches his tongue he gulps it down. More food follows. He lifts a plate to his lips, shoveling down the last of Ma&rsquo;s leavings. Fish and lank coriander and hot thick oil slip down like blessings.</p>

<p><q>Good. Good.</q> Ma waves at the night stall man and a whiskey glass is quickly rinsed and handed to him.</p>

<p>The sharp scent of liquor floats around Ma like an aura as he pours. Tranh&rsquo;s chest tightens at the scent. Oil coats his chin where he has made a mess in his haste. He wipes his mouth against his arm, watching the amber liquid splash into the glass.</p>

<p>Tranh once drank Cognac: XO. Imported by his own clippers. Fabulously expensive stuff with its shipping costs. A flavor of the foreign devils from before the Contraction. A ghost from utopian history, reinvigorated by the new Expansion and his own realization that the world was once again growing smaller. With new hull designs and polymer advances, his clipper ships navigated the globe and returned with the stuff of legends. And his Malay buyers were happy to purchase it, whatever their religion. What a profit that had been. He forces down the thought as Ma shoves the glass across to Tranh and then raises his own in toast. It is in the past. It is all in the past.</p>

<p>They drink. The whiskey burns warm in Tranh&rsquo;s belly, joining the chilis and fish and pork and the hot oil of the fried noodles.</p>

<p><q>It really is too bad you didn&rsquo;t get that job.</q></p>

<p>Tranh grimaces. <q>Don&rsquo;t gloat. Fate has a way of balancing itself. I&rsquo;ve learned that.</q></p>

<p>Ma waves a hand. <q>I don&rsquo;t gloat. There are too many of us, that&rsquo;s the truth. You were ten thousand times qualified for that job. For any job.</q> He takes a sip of his whiskey, peers over its rim at Tranh. <q>Do you remember when you called me a lazy cockroach?</q></p>

<p>Tranh shrugs; he can&rsquo;t take his eyes off the whiskey bottle. <q>I called you worse than that.</q> He waits to see if Ma will refill his cup again. Wondering how rich he is, and how far this largesse will go. Hating that he plays beggar to a boy he once refused to keep as a clerk, and who now lords over him &hellip; and who now, in a show of face, pours Tranh&rsquo;s whiskey to the top, letting it spill over in an amber cascade under the flickering light of the candles.</p>

<p>Ma finishes pouring, stares at the puddle he has created. <q>Truly the world is turned upside down. The young lord over the old. The Malays pinch out the Chinese. And the foreign devils return to our shores like bloated fish after a <i>ku-shui</i> epidemic.</q> Ma smiles. <q>You need to keep your ears up, and be aware of opportunities. Not like all those old men out on the sidewalk, waiting for hard labor. Find a new niche. That&rsquo;s what I did. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve got my job.</q></p>

<p>Tranh grimaces. <q>You came at a more fortuitous time.</q> He rallies, emboldened by a full belly and the liquor warming his face and limbs. <q>Anyway, you shouldn&rsquo;t be too proud. You still stink of mother&rsquo;s milk as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, living in the Dung Lord&rsquo;s tower. You&rsquo;re only the Lord of Yellow Cards. And what is that, really? You haven&rsquo;t climbed as high as my ankles yet, Mr. Big Name.</q></p>

<p>Ma&rsquo;s eyes widen. He laughs. <q>No. Of course not. Someday, maybe. But I am trying to learn from you.</q> He smiles slightly and nods at Tranh&rsquo;s decrepit state. <q>Everything except this postscript.</q></p>

<p><q>Is it true there are crank fans on the top floors? That it&rsquo;s cool up there?</q></p>

<p>Ma glances up at the looming high-rise. <q>Yes. Of course. And men with the calories to wind them as well. And they haul water up for us, and men act as ballast on the elevator&mdash;up and down all day&mdash;doing favors for the Dung Lord.</q> He laughs and pours more whiskey, motions Tranh to drink. <q class="continued">You&rsquo;re right though. It&rsquo;s nothing, really. A poor palace, truly.</q></p>

<p><q>But it doesn&rsquo;t matter now. My family moves tomorrow. We have our residence permits. Tomorrow when I get paid again, we&rsquo;re moving out. No more yellow card for us. No more payoffs to the Dung Lord&rsquo;s lackeys. No more problems with the white shirts. It&rsquo;s all set with the Environment Ministry. We turn in our yellow cards and become Thai. We&rsquo;re going to be immigrants. Not just some invasive species anymore.</q> He raises his glass. <q>It&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m celebrating.</q></p>

<p>Tranh scowls. <q>You must be pleased.</q> He finishes his drink, sets the tumbler down with a thud. <q>Just don&rsquo;t forget that the nail that stands up also gets pounded down.</q></p>

<p>Ma shakes his head and grins, his eyes whiskey bright. <q>Bangkok isn&rsquo;t Malacca.</q></p>

<p><q>And Malacca wasn&rsquo;t Bali. And then they came with their machetes and their spring guns and they stacked our heads in the gutters and sent our bodies and blood down the river to Singapore.</q></p>

<p>Ma shrugs. <q>It&rsquo;s in the past.</q> He waves to the man at the wok, calling for more food. <q>We have to make a home here, now.</q></p>

<p><q>You think you can? You think some white shirt won&rsquo;t nail your hide to his door? You can&rsquo;t make them like us. Our luck&rsquo;s against us, here.</q></p>

<p><q>Luck? When did Mr. Three Prosperities get so superstitious?</q></p>

<p>Ma&rsquo;s dish arrives, tiny crabs crisp-fried, salted, and hot with oil for Ma and Tranh to pick at with chopsticks and crunch between their teeth, each one no bigger than the tip of Tranh&rsquo;s pinkie. Ma plucks one out and crunches it down. <q>When did Mr. Three Prosperities get so weak? When you fired me, you said I made my own luck. And now you tell me you don&rsquo;t have any?</q> He spits on the sidewalk. <q>I&rsquo;ve seen windups with more will to survive than you.</q></p>

<p><i><q>Fang pi.</q></i></p>

<p><q>No! It&rsquo;s true! There&rsquo;s a Japanese windup girl in the bars where my boss goes.</q> Ma leans forward. <q>She looks like a real woman. And she does disgusting things.</q> He grins. <q>Makes your cock hard. But you don&rsquo;t hear her complaining about luck. Every white shirt in the city would pay to dump her in the methane composters and she&rsquo;s still up in her high-rise, dancing every night, in front of everyone. Her whole soulless body on display.</q></p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s not possible.</q></p>

<p>Ma shrugs. <q>Say so if you like. But I&rsquo;ve seen her. And she isn&rsquo;t starving. She takes whatever spit and money come her way, and she survives. It doesn&rsquo;t matter about the white shirts or the Kingdom edicts or the Japan-haters or the religious fanatics; she&rsquo;s been dancing for months.</q></p>

<p><q>How can she survive?</q></p>

<p><q>Bribes? Maybe some ugly <i>farang</i> who wallows in her filth? Who knows? No real girl would do what she does. It makes your heart stop. You forget she&rsquo;s a windup, when she does those things.</q> He laughs, then glances at Tranh. <q>Don&rsquo;t talk to me about luck. There&rsquo;s not enough luck in the entire Kingdom to keep her alive this long. And we know it&rsquo;s not karma that keeps her alive. She has none.</q></p>

<p>Tranh shrugs noncommittally and shovels more crabs into his mouth.</p>

<p>Ma grins. <q>You know I&rsquo;m right.</q> He drains his whiskey glass and slams it down on the table. <q>We make our own luck! Our own fate. There&rsquo;s a windup in a public bar and I have a job with a rich <i>farang</i> who can&rsquo;t find his ass without my help! Of course I&rsquo;m right!</q> He pours more whiskey. <q>Get over your self-pity, and climb out of your hole. The foreign devils don&rsquo;t worry about luck or fate, and look how they return to us, like a newly engineered virus! Even the Contraction didn&rsquo;t stop them. They&rsquo;re like another invasion of devil cats. But they make their own luck. I&rsquo;m not even sure if karma exists for them. And if fools like these <i>farang</i> can succeed, than we Chinese can&rsquo;t be kept down for long. Men make their own luck, that&rsquo;s what you told me when you fired me. You said I&rsquo;d made my own bad luck and only had myself to blame.</q></p>

<p>Tranh looks up at Ma. <q>Maybe I could work at your company.</q> He grins, trying not to look desperate. <q>I could make money for your lazy boss.</q></p>

<p>Ma&rsquo;s eyes become hooded. <q>Ah. That&rsquo;s difficult. Difficult to say.</q></p>

<p>Tranh knows that he should take the polite rejection, that he should shut up. But even as a part of him cringes, his mouth opens again, pressing, pleading. <q>Maybe you need an assistant? To keep the books? I speak their devil language. I taught it to myself when I traded with them. I could be useful.</q></p>

<p><q>There is little enough work for me.</q></p>

<p><q>But if he is as stupid as you say&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>Stupid, yes. But not such a stupid melon that he wouldn&rsquo;t notice another body in his office. Our desks are just so far apart.</q> He makes a motion with his hands. <q>You think he would not notice some stick coolie man squatting besides his computer treadle?</q></p>

<p><q>In his factory, then?</q></p>

<p>But Ma is already shaking his head. <q>I would help you if I could. But the megodont unions control the power, and the line inspector unions are closed to <i>farang</i>, no offense, and no one will accept that you are a materials scientist.</q> He shakes his head. <q>No. There is no way.</q></p>

<p><q>Any job. As a dung shoveler, even.</q></p>

<p>But Ma is shaking his head more vigorously now, and Tranh finally manages to control his tongue, to plug this diarrhea of begging. <q>Never mind. Never mind.</q> He forces a grin. <q>I&rsquo;m sure some work will turn up. I&rsquo;m not worried.</q> He takes the bottle of Mekong whiskey and refills Ma&rsquo;s glass, upending the bottle and finishing the whiskey despite Ma&rsquo;s protests.</p>

<p>Tranh raises his half-empty glass and toasts the young man who has bested him in all ways before throwing back the last of the alcohol in one swift swallow. Under the table, nearly invisible devil cats brush against his bony legs, waiting for him to leave, hoping that he will be foolish enough to leave scraps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Morning dawns. Tranh wanders the streets, hunting for a breakfast he cannot afford. He threads through market alleys redolent with fish and lank green coriander and bright flares of lemongrass. Durians lie in reeking piles, their spiky skins covered with red blister rust boils. He wonders if he can steal one. Their yellow surfaces are blotched and stained, but their guts are nutritious. He wonders how much blister rust a man can consume before falling into a coma.</p>

<p><q>You want? Special deal. Five for five baht. Good, yes?</q></p>

<p>The woman who screeches at him has no teeth, she smiles with her gums and repeats herself. <q>Five for five baht.</q> She speaks Mandarin to him, recognizing him for their common heritage though she had the luck to be born in the Kingdom and he had the misfortune to be set down in Malaya. Chiu Chow Chinese, blessedly protected by her clan and King. Tranh suppresses envy.</p>

<p><q>More like four for four.</q> He makes a pun of the homonyms. <i>Sz</i> for <i>sz</i>. Four for death. <q>They&rsquo;ve got blister rust.</q></p>

<p>She waves a hand sourly. <q>Five for five. They&rsquo;re still good. Better than good. Picked just before.</q> She wields a gleaming machete and chops the durian in half, revealing the clean yellow slime of its interior with its fat gleaming pits. The sickly sweet scent of fresh durian boils up and envelops them. <q>See! Inside good. Picked just in time. Still safe.</q></p>

<p><q>I might buy one.</q> He can&rsquo;t afford any. But he can&rsquo;t help replying. It feels too good to be seen as a buyer. It is his suit, he realizes. The Hwang Brothers have raised him in this woman&rsquo;s eyes. She wouldn&rsquo;t have spoken if not for the suit. Wouldn&rsquo;t have even started the conversation.</p>

<p><q>Buy more! The more you buy, the more you save.</q></p>

<p>He forces a grin, wondering how to get away from the bargaining he should never have started. <q>I&rsquo;m only one old man. I don&rsquo;t need so much.</q></p>

<p><q>One skinny old man. Eat more. Get fat!</q></p>

<p>She says this and they both laugh. He searches for a response, something to keep their comradely interaction alive, but his tongue fails him. She sees the helplessness in his eyes. She shakes her head. <q>Ah, grandfather. It is hard times for everyone. Too many of you all at once. No one thought it would get so bad down there.</q></p>

<p>Tranh ducks his head, embarrassed. <q>I&rsquo;ve troubled you. I should go.</q></p>

<p><q>Wait. Here.</q> She offers him the durian half. <q>Take it.</q></p>

<p><q>I can&rsquo;t afford it.</q></p>

<p>She makes an impatient gesture. <q>Take it. It&rsquo;s lucky for me to help someone from the old country.</q> She grins. <q>And the blister rust looks too bad to sell to anyone else.</q></p>

<p><q>You&rsquo;re kind. Buddha smile on you.</q> But as he takes her gift he again notices the great durian pile behind her. All neatly stacked with their blotches and their bloody wheals of blister rust. Just like stacked Chinese heads in Malacca: his wife and daughters staring out at him, accusatory. He drops the durian and kicks it away, frantically scraping his hands on his jacket, trying to get the blood off his palms.</p>

<p><q>Ai! You&rsquo;ll waste it!</q></p>

<p>Tranh barely hears the woman&rsquo;s cry. He staggers back from the fallen durian, staring at its ragged surface. Its gut-spilled interior. He looks around wildly. He has to get out of the crowds. Has to get away from the jostling bodies and the durian reek that&rsquo;s all around, thick in his throat, gagging him. He puts a hand to his mouth and runs, clawing at the other shoppers, fighting through their press.</p>

<p><q>Where you go? Come back! <i>Huilai!</i></q> But the woman&rsquo;s words are quickly drowned. Tranh shoves through the throng, pushing aside women with shopping baskets full of white lotus root and purple eggplants, dodging farmers and their clattering bamboo hand carts, twisting past tubs of squid and serpent head fish. He pelts down the market alley like a thief identified, scrambling and dodging, running without thought or knowledge of where he is going, but running anyway, desperate to escape the stacked heads of his family and countrymen.</p>

<p>He runs and runs.</p>

<p>And bursts into the open thoroughfare of Charoen Krung Road. Powdered dung dust and hot sunlight wash over him. Cycle rickshaws clatter past. Palms and squat banana trees shimmer green in the bright open air.</p>

<p>As quickly as it seized him, Tranh&rsquo;s panic fades. He stops short, hands on his knees, catching his breath and cursing himself. <i>Fool. Fool. If you don&rsquo;t eat, you die.</i> He straightens and tries to turn back but the stacked durians flash in his mind and he stumbles away from the alley, gagging again. He can&rsquo;t go back. Can&rsquo;t face those bloody piles. He doubles over and his stomach heaves but his empty guts bring up nothing but strings of drool.</p>

<p>Finally he wipes his mouth on a Hwang Brothers sleeve and forces himself to straighten and confront the foreign faces all around. The sea of foreigners that he must learn to swim amongst, and who all call him <i>farang</i>. It repels him to think of it. And to think that in Malacca, with twenty generations of family and clan well rooted in that city, he was just as much an interloper. That his clan&rsquo;s esteemed history is nothing but a footnote for a Chinese expansion that has proven as transient as nighttime cool. That his people were nothing but an accidental spillage of rice on a map, now wiped up much more carefully than they were scattered down.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tranh unloads U-Tex Brand RedSilks deep into the night, offerings to Potato God. A lucky job. A lucky moment, even if his knees have become loose and wobbly and feel as if they must soon give way. A lucky job, even if his arms are shaking from catching the heavy sacks as they come down off the megodonts. Tonight, he reaps not just pay but also the opportunity to steal from the harvest. Even if the RedSilk potatoes are small and harvested early to avoid a new sweep of scabis mold&mdash;the fourth genetic variation this year&mdash;they are still good. And their small size means their enhanced nutrition falls easily into his pockets.</p>

<p>Hu crouches above him, lowering down the potatoes. As the massive elephantine megodonts shuffle and grunt, waiting for their great wagons to be unloaded, Tranh catches Hu&rsquo;s offerings with his hand hooks and lowers the sacks the last step to the ground. Hook, catch, swing, and lower. Again and again and again.</p>

<p>He is not alone in his work. Women from the tower slums crowd around his ladder. They reach up and caress each sack as he lowers it to the ground. Their fingers quest along hemp and burlap, testing for holes, for slight tears, for lucky gifts. A thousand times they stroke his burdens, reverently following the seams, only drawing away when coolie men shove between them to heft the sacks and haul them to Potato God.</p>

<p>After the first hour of his work, Tranh&rsquo;s arms are shaking. After three, he can barely stand. He teeters on his creaking ladder as he lowers each new sack, and gasps and shakes his head to clear sweat from his eyes as he waits for the next one to come down.</p>

<p>Hu peers down from above. <q>Are you all right?</q></p>

<p>Tranh glances warily over his shoulder. Potato God is watching, counting the sacks as they are carried into the warehouse. His eyes occasionally flick up to the wagons and trace across Tranh. Beyond him, fifty unlucky men watch silently from the shadows, any one of them far more observant than Potato God can ever be. Tranh straightens and reaches up to accept the next sack, trying not to think about the watching eyes. How politely they wait. How silent. How hungry. <q>I&rsquo;m fine. Just fine.</q></p>

<p>Hu shrugs and pushes the next burlap load over the wagon&rsquo;s lip. Hu has the better place, but Tranh cannot resent it. One or the other must suffer. And Hu found the job. Hu has the right to the best place. To rest a moment before the next sack moves. After all, Hu collected Tranh for the job when he should have starved tonight. It is fair.</p>

<p>Tranh takes the sack and lowers it into the forest of waiting women&rsquo;s hands, releases his hooks with a twist, and drops the bag to the ground. His joints feel loose and rubbery, as if femur and tibia will skid apart at any moment. He is dizzy with heat, but he dares not ask to slow the pace.</p>

<p>Another potato sack comes down. Women&rsquo;s hands rise up like tangling strands of seaweed, touching, prodding, hungering. He cannot force them back. Even if he shouts at them they return. They are like devil cats; they cannot help themselves. He drops the sack the last few feet to the ground and reaches up for another as it comes over the wagon&rsquo;s lip.</p>

<p>As he hooks the sack, his ladder creaks and suddenly slides. It chatters down the side of the wagon, then catches abruptly. Tranh sways, juggling the potato sack, trying to regain his center of gravity. Hands are all around him, tugging at the bag, pulling, prodding. <q>Watch out&mdash;</q></p>

<p>The ladder skids again. He drops like a stone. Women scatter as he plunges. He hits the ground and pain explodes in his knee. The potato sack bursts. For a moment he worries what Potato God will say but then he hears screams all around him. He rolls onto his back. Above him, the wagon is swaying, shuddering. People are shouting and fleeing. The megodont lunges forward and the wagon heaves. Bamboo ladders fall like rain, slapping the pavement with bright firecracker retorts. The beast reverses itself and the wagon skids past Tranh, grinding the ladders to splinters. It is impossibly fast, even with the wagon&rsquo;s weight still hampering it. The megodont&rsquo;s great maw opens and suddenly it is screaming, a sound as high and panicked as a human&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>All around them, other megodonts respond in a chorus. Their cacophony swamps the street. The megodont surges onto its hind legs, an explosion of muscle and velocity that breaks the wagon&rsquo;s traces and flips it like a toy. Men cartwheel from it, blossoms shaken from a cherry tree. Maddened, the beast rears again and kicks the wagon. Sends it skidding sidewise. It slams past Tranh, missing him by inches.</p>

<p>Tranh tries to rise but his leg won&rsquo;t work. The wagon smashes into a wall. Bamboo and teak crackle and explode, the wagon disintegrating as the megodont drags and kicks it, trying to win free completely. Tranh drags himself away from the flying wagon, hand over hand, hauling his useless leg behind him. All around, men are shouting instructions, trying to control the beast, but he doesn&rsquo;t look back. He focuses on the cobbles ahead, on getting out of reach. His leg won&rsquo;t work. It refuses him. It seems to hate him.</p>

<p>Finally he makes it into the shelter of a protective wall. He hauls himself upright. <q>I&rsquo;m fine,</q> he tells himself. <q>Fine.</q> Gingerly he tests his leg, setting weight on it. It&rsquo;s wobbly, but he feels no real pain, not now. <i><q>Mei wenti. Mei wenti,</q></i> he whispers. <q>Not a problem. Just cracked it. Not a problem.</q></p>

<p>The men are still shouting and the megodont is still screaming, but all he can see is his brittle old knee. He lets go of the wall. Takes a step, testing his weight, and collapses like a shadow puppet with strings gone slack.</p>

<p>Gritting his teeth, he again hauls himself up off the cobbles. He props himself against the wall, massaging his knee and watching the bedlam. Men are throwing ropes over the back of the struggling megodont, pulling it down, immobilizing it, finally. More than a score of men are working to hobble it.</p>

<p>The wagon&rsquo;s frame has shattered completely and potatoes are spilled everywhere. A thick mash coats the ground. Women scramble on their knees, clawing through the mess, fighting with one another to hoard pulped tubers. They scrape it up from the street. Some of their scavenge is stained red, but no one seems to care. Their squabbling continues. The red bloom spreads. At the blossom&rsquo;s center, a man&rsquo;s trousers protrude from the muck.</p>

<p>Tranh frowns. He drags himself upright again and hops on his one good leg toward the broken wagon. He catches up against its shattered frame, staring. Hu&rsquo;s body is a savage ruin, awash in megodont dung and potato mash. And now that Tranh is close, he can see that the struggling megodont&rsquo;s great gray feet are gory with his friend. Someone is calling for a doctor but it is half-hearted, a habit from a time when they were not yellow cards.</p>

<p>Tranh tests his weight again but his knee provides the same queer jointless failure. He catches up against the wagon&rsquo;s splintered planking and hauls himself back upright. He works the leg, trying to understand why it collapses. The knee bends, it doesn&rsquo;t even hurt particularly, but it will not support his weight. He tests it again, with the same result.</p>

<p>With the megodont restrained, order in the unloading area is restored. Hu&rsquo;s body is dragged aside. Devil cats gather near his blood pool, feline shimmers under methane glow. Their tracks pock the potato grime in growing numbers. More paw impressions appear in the muck, closing from all directions on Hu&rsquo;s discarded body.</p>

<p>Tranh sighs. So we all go, he thinks. We all die. Even those of us who took our aging treatments and our tiger penis and kept ourselves strong are subject to the Hell journey. He promises to burn money for Hu, to ease his way in the afterlife, then catches himself and remembers that he is not the man he was. That even paper Hell Money is out of reach.</p>

<p>Potato God, disheveled and angry, comes and studies him. He frowns suspiciously. <q>Can you still work?</q></p>

<p><q>I can.</q> Tranh tries to walk but stumbles once again and catches up against the wagon&rsquo;s shattered frame.</p>

<p>Potato God shakes his head. <q>I will pay you for the hours you worked.</q> He waves to a young man, fresh and grinning from binding the megodont. <q>You! You&rsquo;re a quick one. Haul the rest of these sacks into the warehouse.</q></p>

<p>Already, other workers are lining up and grabbing loads from within the broken wagon. As the new man comes out with his first sack, his eyes dart to Tranh and then flick away, hiding his relief at Tranh&rsquo;s incapacity.</p>

<p>Potato God watches with satisfaction and heads back to the warehouse.</p>

<p><q>Double pay,</q> Tranh calls after Potato God&rsquo;s retreating back. <q>Give me double pay. I lost my leg for you.</q></p>

<p>The manager looks back at Tranh with pity, then glances at Hu&rsquo;s body and shrugs. It is an easy acquiescence. Hu will demand no reparation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is better to die insensate than to feel every starving inch of collapse; Tranh pours his leg-wreck money into a bottle of Mekong whiskey. He is old. He is broken. He is the last of his line. His sons are dead. His daughters are long gone. His ancestors will live uncared for in the underworld with no one to burn incense or offer sweet rice to them.</p>

<p>How they must curse him.</p>

<p>He limps and stumbles and crawls through the sweltering night streets, one hand clutching the open bottle, the other scrabbling at doorways and walls and methane lamp posts to keep himself upright. Sometimes his knee works; sometimes it fails him completely. He has kissed the streets a dozen times.</p>

<p>He tells himself that he is scavenging, hunting for the chance of sustenance. But Bangkok is a city of scavengers and the crows and devil cats and children have all come before him. If he is truly lucky, he will encounter the white shirts and they will knock him into bloody oblivion, perhaps send him to meet the previous owner of this fine Hwang Brothers suit that now flaps ragged around his shins. The thought appeals to him.</p>

<p>An ocean of whiskey rolls in his empty belly and he is warm and happy and carefree for the first time since the Incident. He laughs and drinks and shouts for the white shirts, calling them paper tigers, calling them dog fuckers. He calls them to him. Casts baiting words so that any within earshot will find him irresistible. But the Environment Ministry&rsquo;s patrols must have other yellow cards to abuse, for Tranh wanders the green-tinged streets of Bangkok alone.</p>

<p>Never mind. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. If he cannot find white shirts to do the job, he will drown himself. He will go to the river and dump himself in its offal. Floating on river currents to the sea appeals to him. He will end in the ocean like his scuttled clipper ships and the last of his heirs. He takes a swig of whiskey, loses his balance and winds up on the ground once again, sobbing and cursing white shirts and green headbands, and wet machetes.</p>

<p>Finally he drags himself into a doorway to rest, holding his miraculously unbroken whiskey bottle with one feeble hand. He cradles it to himself like a last bit of precious jade, smiling and laughing that it is not broken. He wouldn&rsquo;t want to waste his life savings on the cobblestones.</p>

<p>He takes another swig. Stares at the methane lamps flickering overhead. Despair is the color of approved burn methane flickering green and gaseous, vinous in the dark. Green used to mean things like coriander and silk and jade, and now all it means to him is bloodthirsty men with patriotic headbands and hungry scavenging nights. The lamps flicker. An entire green city. An entire city of despair.</p>

<p>Across the street, a shape scuttles, keeping to the shadows. Tranh leans forward, eyes narrowed. At first he takes it for a white shirt. But no. It is too furtive. It&rsquo;s a woman. A girl. A pretty creature, all made up. An enticement that moves with the stuttery jerky motion of &hellip;</p>

<p>A windup girl.</p>

<p>Tranh grins, a surprised skeleton rictus of delight at the sight of this unnatural creature stealing through the night. A windup girl. Ma Ping&rsquo;s windup girl. The impossible made flesh.</p>

<p>She slips from shadow to shadow, a creature even more terrified of white shirts than a yellow card geriatric. A waifish ghost child ripped from her natural habitat and set down in a city that despises everything she represents: her genetic inheritance, her manufacturers, her unnatural competition&mdash;her ghostly lack of a soul. She has been here every night as he has pillaged through discarded melon spines. She has been here, tottering through the sweat heat darkness as he dodged white shirt patrols. And despite everything, she has been surviving.</p>

<p>Tranh forces himself upright. He sways, drunken and unsteady, then follows, one hand clutching his whiskey bottle, the other touching walls, catching himself when his bad knee falters. It&rsquo;s a foolish thing, a whimsy, but the windup girl has seized his inebriated imagination. He wants to stalk this unlikely Japanese creation, this interloper on foreign soil even more despised than himself. He wants to follow her. Perhaps steal kisses from her. Perhaps protect her from the hazards of the night. To pretend at least that he is not this drunken ribcage caricature of a man, but is in fact a tiger still.</p>

<p>The windup girl travels through the blackest of back alleys, safe in darkness, hidden from the white shirts who would seize her and mulch her before she could protest. Devil cats yowl as she passes, scenting something as cynically engineered as themselves. The Kingdom is infested with plagues and beasts, besieged by so many bioengineered monsters that it cannot keep up. As small as gray <i>fa&rsquo; gan</i> fringe and as large as megodonts, they come. And as the Kingdom struggles to adapt, Tranh slinks after a windup girl, both of them as invasive as blister rust on a durian and just as welcome.</p>

<p>For all her irregular motion, the windup girl travels well enough. Tranh has difficulty keeping up with her. His knees creak and grind and he clenches his teeth against the pain. Sometimes he falls with a muffled grunt, but still he follows. Ahead of him, the windup girl ducks into new shadows, a wisp of tottering motion. Her herky-jerky gait announces her as a creature not human, no matter how beautiful she may be. No matter how intelligent, no matter how strong, no matter how supple her skin, she is a windup and meant to serve&mdash;and marked as such by a genetic specification that betrays her with every unnatural step.</p>

<p>Finally, when Tranh thinks that his legs will give out for a final time and that he can continue no longer, the windup girl pauses. She stands in the black mouth of a crumbling high-rise, a tower as tall and wretched as his own, another carcass of the old Expansion. From high above, music and laughter filter down. Shapes float in the tower&rsquo;s upper-story windows, limned in red light, the silhouettes of women dancing. Calls of men and the throb of drums. The windup girl disappears inside.</p>

<p>What would it be like to enter such a place? To spend baht like water while women danced and sang songs of lust? Tranh suddenly regrets spending his last baht on whiskey. This is where he should have died. Surrounded by fleshly pleasures that he has not known since he lost his country and his life. He purses his lips, considering. Perhaps he can bluff his way in. He still wears the raiment of the Hwang Brothers. He still appears a gentleman, perhaps. Yes. He will attempt it, and if he gathers the shame of ejection on his head, if he loses face one more time, what of it? He will be dead in a river soon anyway, floating to the sea to join his sons.</p>

<p>He starts to cross the street but his knee gives out and he falls flat instead. He saves his whiskey bottle more by luck than by dexterity. The last of its amber liquid glints in the methane light. He grimaces and pulls himself into a sitting position, then drags himself back into a doorway. He will rest, first. And finish the bottle. The windup girl will be there for a long time, likely. He has time to recover himself. And if he falls again, at least he won&rsquo;t have wasted his liquor. He tilts the bottle to his lips, then lets his tired head rest against the building. He&rsquo;ll just catch his breath.</p>

<p>Laughter issues from the high-rise. Tranh jerks awake. A man stumbles from its shadow portal: drunk, laughing. More men spill out after him. They laugh and shove one another. Drag tittering women out with them. Motion to cycle rickshaws that wait in the alleys for easy drunken patrons. Slowly, they disperse. Tranh tilts his whiskey bottle. Finds it empty.</p>

<p>Another pair of men emerges from the high-rise&rsquo;s maw. One of them is Ma Ping. The other a <i>farang</i> who can only be Ma&rsquo;s boss. The <i>farang</i> waves for a cycle rickshaw. He climbs in and waves his farewells. Ma raises his own hand in return and his gold and diamond wristwatch glints in the methane light. Tranh&rsquo;s wristwatch. Tranh&rsquo;s history. Tranh&rsquo;s heirloom flashing bright in the darkness. Tranh scowls. Wishes he could rip it off young Ma&rsquo;s wrist.</p>

<p>The <i>farang&rsquo;s</i> rickshaw starts forward with a screech of unoiled bicycle chains and drunken laughter, leaving Ma Ping standing alone in the middle of the street. Ma laughs to himself, seems to consider returning to the bars, then laughs again and turns away, heading across the street, toward Tranh.</p>

<p>Tranh shies into the shadows, unwilling to let Ma catch him in such a state. Unwilling to endure more humiliation. He crouches deeper in his doorway as Ma stumbles about the street in search of rickshaws. But all the rickshaws have been taken for the moment. No more lurk below the bars.</p>

<p>Ma&rsquo;s gold wristwatch glints again in the methane light.</p>

<p>Pale forms glazed green materialize on the street, three men walking, their mahogany skin almost black in the darkness, contrasting sharply against the creased whites of their uniforms. Their black batons twirl casually at their wrists. Ma doesn&rsquo;t seem to notice them at first. The white shirts converge, casual. Their voices carry easily in the quiet night.</p>

<p><q>You&rsquo;re out late.</q></p>

<p>Ma shrugs, grins queasily. <q>Not really. Not so late.</q></p>

<p>The three white shirts gather close. <q>Late for a yellow card. You should be home by now. Bad luck to be out after yellow card curfew. Especially with all that yellow gold on your wrist.</q></p>

<p>Ma holds up his hands, defensive. <q>I&rsquo;m not a yellow card.</q></p>

<p><q>Your accent says differently.</q></p>

<p>Ma reaches for his pockets, fumbles in them. <q>Really. You&rsquo;ll see. Look.</q></p>

<p>A white shirt steps close. <q>Did I say you could move?</q></p>

<p><q>My papers. Look&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>Get your hands out!</q></p>

<p><q>Look at my stamps!</q></p>

<p><q>Out!</q> A black baton flashes. Ma yelps, clutches his elbow. More blows rain down. Ma crouches, trying to shield himself. He curses, <i><q>Nimade bi!</q></i></p>

<p>The white shirts laugh. <q>That&rsquo;s yellow card talk.</q> One of them swings his baton, low and fast, and Ma collapses, crying out, curling around a damaged leg. The white shirts gather close. One of them jabs Ma in the face, making him uncurl, then runs the baton down Ma&rsquo;s chest, dragging blood.</p>

<p><q>He&rsquo;s got nicer clothes than you, Thongchai.</q></p>

<p><q>Probably snuck across the border with an assful of jade.</q></p>

<p>One of them squats, studies Ma&rsquo;s face. <q>Is it true? Do you shit jade?</q></p>

<p>Ma shakes his head frantically. He rolls over and starts to crawl away. A black runnel of blood spills from his mouth. One leg drags behind him, useless. A white shirt follows, pushes him over with his shoe and puts his foot on Ma&rsquo;s face. The other two suck in their breath and step back, shocked. To beat a man is one thing &hellip; <q>Suttipong, no.</q></p>

<p>The man called Suttipong glances back at his peers. <q>It&rsquo;s nothing. These yellow cards are as bad as blister rust. This is nothing. They all come begging, taking food when we&rsquo;ve got little enough for our own, and look,</q> he kicks Ma&rsquo;s wrist. <q>Gold.</q></p>

<p>Ma gasps, tries to strip the watch from his wrist. <q>Take it. Here. Please. Take it.</q></p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s not yours to give, yellow card.</q></p>

<p><q>Not &hellip; yellow card,</q> Ma gasps. <q>Please. Not your Ministry.</q> His hands fumble for his pockets, frantic under the white shirt&rsquo;s gaze. He pulls out his papers and waves them in the hot night air.</p>

<p>Suttipong takes the papers, glances at them. Leans close. <q>You think our countrymen don&rsquo;t fear us, too?</q></p>

<p>He throws the papers on the ground, then quick as a cobra he strikes. One, two, three, the blows rain down. He is very fast. Very methodical. Ma curls into a ball, trying to ward off the blows. Suttipong steps back, breathing heavily. He waves at the other two. <q>Teach him respect.</q> The other two glance at each other doubtfully, but under Suttipong&rsquo;s urging, they are soon beating Ma, shouting encouragement to one another.</p>

<p>A few men come down from the pleasure bars and stumble into the streets, but when they see white uniforms they flee back inside. The white shirts are alone. And if there are other watching eyes, they do not show themselves. Finally, Suttipong seems satisfied. He kneels and strips the antique Rolex from Ma&rsquo;s wrist, spits on Ma&rsquo;s face, and motions his peers to join him. They turn away, striding close past Tranh&rsquo;s hiding place.</p>

<p>The one called Thongchai looks back. <q>He might complain.</q></p>

<p>Suttipong shakes his head, his attention on the Rolex in his hand. <q>He&rsquo;s learned his lesson.</q></p>

<p>Their footsteps fade into the darkness. Music filters down from the high-rise clubs. The street itself is silent. Tranh watches for a long time, looking for other hunters. Nothing moves. It is as if the entire city has turned its back on the broken Malay-Chinese lying in the street. Finally, Tranh limps out of the shadows and approaches Ma Ping.</p>

<p>Ma catches sight of him and holds up a weak hand. <q>Help.</q> He tries the words in Thai, again in <i>farang</i> English, finally in Malay, as though he has returned to his childhood. Then he seems to recognize Tranh. His eyes widen. He smiles weakly, through split bloody lips. Speaks Mandarin, their trade language of brotherhood. <q><i>Lao pengyou.</i>What are you doing here?</q></p>

<p>Tranh squats beside him, studying his cracked face. <q>I saw your windup girl.</q></p>

<p>Ma closes his eyes, tries to smile. <q>You believe me, then?</q> His eyes are nearly swollen shut, blood runs down from a cut in his brow, trickling freely.</p>

<p><q>Yes.</q></p>

<p><q>I think they broke my leg.</q> He tries to pull himself upright, gasps, and collapses. He probes his ribs, runs his hand down to his shin. <q>I can&rsquo;t walk.</q> He sucks air as he prods another broken bone. <q>You were right about the white shirts.</q></p>

<p><q>A nail that stands up gets pounded down.</q></p>

<p>Something in Tranh&rsquo;s tone makes Ma look up. He studies Tranh&rsquo;s face. <q>Please. I gave you food. Find me a rickshaw.</q> One hand strays to his wrist, fumbling for the timepiece that is no longer his, trying to offer it. Trying to bargain.</p>

<p>Is this fate? Tranh wonders. Or luck? Tranh purses his lips, considering. Was it fate that his own shiny wristwatch drew the white shirts and their wicked black batons? Was it luck that he arrived to see Ma fall? Do he and Ma Ping still have some larger karmic business?</p>

<p>Tranh watches Ma beg and remembers firing a young clerk so many lifetimes ago, sending him packing with a thrashing and a warning never to return. But that was when he was a great man. And now he is such a small one. As small as the clerk he thrashed so long ago. Perhaps smaller. He slides his hands under Ma&rsquo;s back, lifts.</p>

<p><q>Thank you,</q> Ma gasps. <q>Thank you.</q></p>

<p>Tranh runs his fingers into Ma&rsquo;s pockets, working through them methodically, checking for baht the white shirts have left. Ma groans, forces out a curse as Tranh jostles him. Tranh counts his scavenge, the dregs of Ma&rsquo;s pockets that still look like wealth to him. He stuffs the coins into his own pocket.</p>

<p>Ma&rsquo;s breathing comes in short panting gasps. <q>Please. A rickshaw. That&rsquo;s all.</q> He barely manages to exhale the words.</p>

<p>Tranh cocks his head, considering, his instincts warring with themselves. He sighs and shakes his head. <q>A man makes his own luck, isn&rsquo;t that what you told me?</q> He smiles tightly. <q>My own arrogant words, coming from a brash young mouth.</q> He shakes his head again, astounded at his previously fat ego, and smashes his whiskey bottle on the cobbles. Glass sprays. Shards glint green in the methane light.</p>

<p><q>If I were still a great man&hellip;.</q> Tranh grimaces. <q>But then, I suppose we&rsquo;re both past such illusions. I&rsquo;m very sorry about this.</q> With one last glance around the darkened street, he drives the broken bottle into Ma&rsquo;s throat. Ma jerks and blood spills out around Tranh&rsquo;s hand. Tranh scuttles back, keeping this new welling of blood off his Hwang Brothers fabrics. Ma&rsquo;s lungs bubble and his hands reach up for the bottle lodged in his neck, then fall away. His wet breathing stops.</p>

<p>Tranh is trembling. His hands shake with an electric palsy. He has seen so much death, and dealt so little. And now Ma lies before him, another Malay-Chinese dead, with only himself to blame. Again. He stifles an urge to be sick.</p>

<p>He turns and crawls into the protective shadows of the alley and pulls himself upright. He tests his weak leg. It seems to hold him. Beyond the shadows, the street is silent. Ma&rsquo;s body lies like a heap of garbage in its center. Nothing moves.</p>

<p>Tranh turns and limps down the street, keeping to the walls, bracing himself when his knee threatens to give way. After a few blocks, the methane lamps start to go out. One by one, as though a great hand is moving down the street snuffing them, they gutter into silence as the Public Works Ministry cuts off the gas. The street settles into complete darkness.</p>

<p>When Tranh finally arrives at Surawong Road, its wide black thoroughfare is nearly empty of traffic. A pair of ancient water buffalo placidly haul a rubber-wheeled wagon under starlight. A shadow farmer rides behind them, muttering softly. The yowls of mating devil cats scrape the hot night air, but that is all.</p>

<p>And then, from behind, the creak of bicycle chains. The rattle of wheels on cobbles. Tranh turns, half expecting avenging white shirts, but it is only a cycle-rickshaw, chattering down the darkened street. Tranh raises a hand, flashing newfound baht. The rickshaw slows. A man&rsquo;s ropey limbs gleam with moonlit sweat. Twin earrings decorate his lobes, gobs of silver in the night. <q>Where you going?</q></p>

<p>Tranh scans the rickshaw man&rsquo;s broad face for hints of betrayal, for hints that he is a hunter, but the man is only looking at the baht in Tranh&rsquo;s hand. Tranh forces down his paranoia and climbs into the rickshaw&rsquo;s seat. <q>The <i>farang</i> factories. By the river.</q></p>

<p>The rickshaw man glances over his shoulder, surprised. <q>All the factories will be closed. Too much energy to run at night. It&rsquo;s all black night down there.</q></p>

<p><q>It doesn&rsquo;t matter. There&rsquo;s a job opening. There will be interviews.</q></p>

<p>The man stands on his pedals. <q>At night?</q></p>

<p><q>Tomorrow.</q> Tranh settles deeper into his seat. <q>I don&rsquo;t want to be late.</q></p>
</body>
