<hr/>

<p class="first"><q><span class="start">No Mammy, No Pappy,</span> poor little bastard. Money? You give money?</q> The urchin turned a cartwheel and then a somersault in the street, stirring yellow dust around his nakedness.</p>

<p>Lalji paused to stare at the dirty blond child who had come to a halt at his feet. The attention seemed to encourage the urchin; the boy did another somersault. He smiled up at Lalji from his squat, calculating and eager, rivulets of sweat and mud streaking his face. <q>Money? You give money?</q></p>

<p>Around them, the town was nearly silent in the afternoon heat. A few dungareed farmers led mulies toward the fields. Buildings, pressed from WeatherAll chips, slumped against their fellows like drunkards, rain-stained and sun-cracked, but, as their trade name implied, still sturdy. At the far end of the narrow street, the lush sprawl of SoyPRO and HiGro began, a waving rustling growth that rolled into the blue-sky distance. It was much as all the villages Lalji had seen as he traveled upriver, just another farming enclave paying its intellectual property dues and shipping calories down to New Orleans.</p>

<p>The boy crawled closer, smiling ingratiatingly, nodding his head like a snake hoping to strike. <q>Money? Money?</q></p>

<p>Lalji put his hands in his pockets in case the beggar child had friends and turned his full attention on the boy. <q>And why should I give money to you?</q></p>

<p>The boy stared up at him, stalled. His mouth opened, then closed. Finally he looped back to an earlier, more familiar part of his script, <q>No mammy? No pappy?</q> but it was a query now, lacking conviction.</p>

<p>Lalji made a face of disgust and aimed a kick at the boy. The child scrambled aside, falling on his back in his desperation to dodge, and this pleased Lalji briefly. At least the boy was quick. He turned and started back up the street. Behind him, the urchin's wailing despair echoed. <q>Noooo maaaammy! Nooo paaaapy!</q> Lalji shook his head, irritated. The child might cry for money, but he failed to follow. No true beggar at all. An opportunist only &mdash; most likely the accidental creation of strangers who had visited the village and were open-fisted when it came to blond beggar children. AgriGen and Midwest Grower scientists and land factotums would be pleased to show ostentatious kindness to the villagers at the core of their empire.</p>

<p>Through a gap in the slumped hovels, Lalji caught another glimpse of the lush waves of SoyPRO and HiGro. The sheer sprawl of calories stimulated tingling fantasies of loading a barge and slipping it down through the locks to St. Louis or New Orleans and into the mouths of waiting megadonts. It was impossible, but the sight of those emerald fields was more than enough assurance that no child could beg with conviction here. Not surrounded by SoyPRO. Lalji shook his head again, disgusted, and squeezed down a footpath between two of the houses.</p>

<p>The acrid reek of WeatherAll's excreted oils clogged the dim alley. A pair of cheshires sheltering in the unused space scattered and molted ahead of him, disappearing into bright sunlight. Just beyond, a kinetic shop leaned against its beaten neighbors, adding the scents of dung and animal sweat to the stink of WeatherAll. Lalji leaned against the shop's plank door and shoved inside.</p>

<p>Shafts of sunlight pierced the sweet manure gloom with lazy gold beams. A pair of hand-painted posters scabbed to one wall, partly torn but still legible. One said: <q>Unstamped calories mean starving families. We check royalty receipts and IP stamps.</q> A farmer and his brood stared hollow-eyed from beneath the scolding words. PurCal was the sponsor. The other poster was AgriGen's trademarked collage of kink-springs, green rows of SoyPRO under sunlight and smiling children along with the words <q>We Provide Energy for the World.</q> Lalji studied the posters sourly.</p>

<p><q>Back already?</q> The owner came in from the winding room, wiping his hands on his pants and kicking straw and mud off his boots. He eyed Lalji. <q>My springs didn't have enough stored. I had to feed the mulies extra, to make your joules.</q></p>

<p>Lalji shrugged, having expected the last-minute bargaining, so much like Shriram's that he couldn't muster the interest to look offended. <q>Yes? How much?</q></p>

<p>The man squinted up at Lalji, then ducked his head, his body defensive. <q>F-Five hundred.</q> His voice caught on the amount, as though gagging on the surprising greed scampering up his throat.</p>

<p>Lalji frowned and pulled his mustache. It was outrageous. The calories hadn't even been transported. The village was awash with energy. And despite the man's virtuous poster, it was doubtful that the calories feeding his kinetic shop were equally upstanding. Not with tempting green fields waving within meters of the shop. Shriram often said that using stamped calories was like dumping money into a methane composter.</p>

<p>Lalji tugged his mustache again, wondering how much to pay for the joules without calling excessive attention to himself. Rich men must have been all over the village to make the kinetic man so greedy. Calorie executives, almost certainly. It would fit. The town was close to the center. Perhaps even this village was engaged in growing the crown jewels of AgriGen's energy monopolies. Still, not everyone who passed through would be as rich as that. <q>Two hundred.</q></p>

<p>The kinetic man showed a relieved smile along with knotted yellow teeth, his guilt apparently assuaged by Lalji's bargaining. <q>Four.</q></p>

<p><q>Two. I can moor on the river and let my own winders do the same work.</q></p>

<p>The man snorted. <q>It would take weeks.</q></p>

<p>Lalji shrugged. <q>I have time. Dump the joules back into your own springs. I'll do the job myself.</q></p>

<p><q>I've got family to feed. Three?</q></p>

<p><q>You live next to more calories than some rich families in St. Louis. Two.</q></p>

<p>The man shook his head sourly but he led Lalji into the winding room. The manure haze thickened. Big kinetic storage drums, twice as tall as a man, sat in a darkened corner, mud and manure lapping around their high-capacity precision kink-springs. Sunbeams poured between open gaps in the roof where shingles had blown away. Dung motes stirred lazily.</p>

<p>A half-dozen hyper-developed mulies crouched on their treadmills, their rib cages billowing slowly, their flanks streaked with salt lines of sweat residue from the labor of winding Lalji's boat springs. They blew air through their nostrils, nervous at Lalji's sudden scent, and gathered their squat legs under them. Muscles like boulders rippled under their bony hides as they stood. They eyed Lalji with resentful near-intelligence. One of them showed stubborn yellow teeth that matched its owner's.</p>

<p>Lalji made a face of disgust. <q>Feed them.</q></p>

<p><q>I already did.</q></p>

<p><q>I can see their bones. If you want my money, feed them again.</q></p>

<p>The man scowled. <q>They aren't supposed to get fat, they're supposed to wind your damn springs.</q> But he dipped double handfuls of SoyPRO into their feed canisters.</p>

<p>The mulies shoved their heads into the buckets, slobbering and grunting with need. In its eagerness, one of them started briefly forward on its treadmill, sending energy into the winding shop's depleted storage springs before seeming to realize that its work was not demanded and that it could eat without molestation.</p>

<p><q>They aren't even designed to get fat,</q> the kinetic man muttered.</p>

<p>Lalji smiled slightly as he counted through his wadded bluebills and handed over the money. The kinetic man unjacked Lalji's kink-springs from the winding treadmills and stacked them beside the slavering mulies. Lalji lifted a spring, grunting at its heft. Its mass was no different than when he had brought it to the winding shop, but now it fairly seemed to quiver with the mulies' stored labor.</p>

<p><q>You want help with those?</q> The man didn't move. His eyes flicked toward the mulies' feed buckets, still calculating his chances of interrupting their meal.</p>

<p>Lalji took his time answering, watching as the mulies rooted for the last of their calories. <q>No.</q> He hefted the spring again, getting a better grip. <q>My helpboy will come for the rest.</q></p>

<p>As he turned for the door, he heard the man dragging the feedbuckets away from the mulies and their grunts as they fought for their sustenance. Once again, Lalji regretted agreeing to the trip at all.</p>

<br/>

<p class="first"><span class="start">Shriram had been</span> the one to broach the idea. They had been sitting under the awning of Lalji's porch in New Orleans, spitting betel nut juice into the alley gutters and watching the rain come down as they played chess. At the end of the alley, cycle rickshaws and bicycles slipped through the mid-morning gray, pulses of green and red and blue as they passed the alley's mouth draped under rain-glossed corn polymer ponchos.</p>

<p>The chess game was a tradition of many years, a ritual when Lalji was in town and Shriram had time away from his small kinetic company where he rewound people's home and boat springs. Theirs was a good friendship, and a fruitful one, when Lalji had unstamped calories that needed to disappear into the mouth of a hungry megadont.</p>

<p>Neither of them played chess well, and so their games often devolved into a series of trades made in dizzying succession; a cascade of destruction that left a board previously well-arrayed in a tantrum wreck, with both opponents blinking surprise, trying to calculate if the mangle had been worth the combat. It was after one of these tit-for-tat cleansings that Shriram had asked Lalji if he might go upriver. Beyond the southern states.</p>

<p>Lalji had shaken his head and spit bloody betel juice into the overflowing gutter. <q>No. Nothing is profitable so far up. Too many joules to get there. Better to let the calories float to me.</q> He was surprised to discover that he still had his queen. He used it to take a pawn.</p>

<p><q>And if the energy costs could be defrayed?</q></p>

<p>Lalji laughed, waiting for Shriram to make his own move. <q>By who? AgriGen? The IP men? Only their boats go up and down so far.</q> He frowned as he realized that his queen was now vulnerable to Shriram's remaining knight.</p>

<p>Shriram was silent. He didn't touch his pieces. Lalji looked up from the board and was surprised by Shriram's serious expression. Shriram said, <q>I would pay. Myself and others. There is a man who some of us would like to see come south. A very special man.</q></p>

<p><q>Then why not bring him south on a paddle wheel? It is expensive to go up the river. How many gigajoules? I would have to change the boat's springs, and then what would the IP patrols ask? <q>Where are you going, strange Indian man with your small boat and your so many springs? Going far? To what purpose?</q></q> Lalji shook his head. <q>Let this man take a ferry, or ride a barge. Isn't this cheaper?</q> He waved at the game board. <q>It's your move. You should take my queen.</q></p>

<p>Shriram waggled his head thoughtfully from side to side but didn't make any move toward the chess game. <q>Cheaper, yes.&hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>But?</q></p>

<p>Shriram shrugged. <q>A swift, inconsequential boat would attract less attention.</q></p>

<p><q>What sort of man is this?</q></p>

<p>Shriram glanced around, suddenly furtive. Methane lamps burned like blue fairies behind the closed glass of the neighbors' droplet-spattered windows. Rain sheeted off their roofs, drumming wet into the empty alley. A cheshire was yowling for a mate somewhere in the wet, barely audible under the thrum of falling water.</p>

<p><q>Is Creo inside?</q></p>

<p>Lalji raised his eyebrows in surprise. <q>He has gone to his gymnasium. Why? Should it matter?</q></p>

<p>Shriram shrugged and gave an embarrassed smile. <q>Some things are better kept between old friends. People with strong ties.</q></p>

<p><q>Creo has been with me for years.</q></p>

<p>Shriram grunted noncommittally, glanced around again and leaned close, pitching his voice low, forcing Lalji to lean forward as well. <q>There is a man who the calorie companies would like very much to find.</q> He tapped his balding head. <q>A very intelligent man. We want to help him.</q></p>

<p>Lalji sucked in his breath. <q>A generipper?</q></p>

<p>Shriram avoided Lalji's eyes. <q>In a sense. A calorie man.</q></p>

<p>Lalji made a face of disgust. <q>Even better reason not to be involved. I don't traffic with those killers.</q></p>

<p><q>No, no. Of course not. But still&hellip;you brought that huge sign down once, did you not? A few greased palms, so smooth, and you float into town and suddenly Lakshmi smiles on you, such a calorie bandit, and now with a name instead as a dealer of antiques. Such a wonderful misdirection.</q></p>

<p>Lalji shrugged. <q>I was lucky. I knew the man to help move it through the locks.</q></p>

<p><q>So? Do it again.</q></p>

<p><q>If the calorie companies are looking for him, it would be dangerous.</q></p>

<p><q>But not impossible. The locks would be easy. Much easier than carrying unlicensed grains. Or even something as big as that sign. This would be a man. No sniffer dog would find him of interest. Place him in a barrel. It would be easy. And I would pay. All your joules, plus more.</q></p>

<p>Lalji sucked at his narcotic betel nut, spit red, spit red again, considering. <q>And what does a second-rate kinetic man like you think this calorie man will do? Generippers work for big fish, and you are such a small one.</q></p>

<p>Shriram grinned haplessly and gave a self-deprecating shrug. <q>You do not think Ganesha Kinetic could not some day be great? The next AgriGen, maybe?</q> and they had both laughed at the absurdity and Shriram dropped the subject.</p>

<p>An IP man was on duty with his dog, blocking Lalji's way as he returned to his boat lugging the kink-spring. The brute's hairs bristled as Lalji approached and it lunged against its leash, its blunt nose quivering to reach him. With effort, the IP man held the creature back. <q>I need to sniff you.</q> His helmet lay on the grass, already discarded, but still he was sweating under the swaddling heat of his gray slash-resistant uniform and the heavy webbing of his spring gun and bandoliers.</p>

<p>Lalji held still. The dog growled, deep from its throat, and inched forward. It snuffled his clothing, bared hungry teeth, snuffled again, then its black ruff iridesced blue and it relaxed and wagged its stubby tail. It sat. A pink tongue lolled from between smiling teeth. Lalji smiled sourly back at the animal, glad that he wasn't smuggling calories and wouldn't have to go through the pantomimes of obeisance as the IP man demanded stamps and then tried to verify that the grain shipment had paid its royalties and licensing fees.</p>

<p>At the dog's change in color, the IP man relaxed somewhat, but still he studied Lalji's features carefully, hunting for recognition against memorized photographs. Lalji waited patiently, accustomed to the scrutiny. Many men tried to steal the honest profits of AgriGen and its peers, but to Lalji's knowledge, he was unknown to the protectors of intellectual property. He was an antiques dealer, handling the junk of the previous century, not a calorie bandit staring out from corporate photo books.</p>

<p>Finally, the IP man waved him past. Lalji nodded politely and made his way down the stairs to the river's low stage where his needleboat was moored. Out on the river, cumbrous grain barges wallowed past, riding low under their burdens.</p>

<p>Though there was a great deal of river traffic, it didn't compare with harvest time. Then the whole of the Mississippi would fill with calories pouring downstream, pulled from hundreds of towns like this one. Barges would clot the arterial flow of the river system from high on the Missouri, the Illinois, and the Ohio and the thousand smaller tributaries. Some of those calories would float only as far as St. Louis where they would be chewed by megadonts and churned into joules, but the rest, the vast majority, would float to New Orleans where the great calorie companies' clippers and dirigibles would be loaded with the precious grains. Then they would cross the Earth on tradewinds and sea, in time for the next season's planting, so that the world could go on eating.</p>

<p>Lalji watched the barges moving slowly past, wallowing and bloated with their wealth, then hefted his kink-spring and jumped aboard his needleboat.</p>

<p>Creo was lying on deck as Lalji had left him, his muscled body oiled and shining in the sun, a blond Arjuna waiting for glorious battle. His cornrows spread around his head in a halo, their tipped bits of bone lying like foretelling stones on the hot deck. He didn't open his eyes as Lalji jumped aboard. Lalji went and stood in Creo's sun, eclipsing his tan. Slowly, the young man opened his blue eyes.</p>

<p><q>Get up.</q> Lalji dropped the spring on Creo's rippled stomach.</p>

<p>Creo let out a whuff and wrapped his arms around the spring. He sat up easily and set it on the deck. <q>Rest of the springs wound?</q></p>

<p>Lalji nodded. Creo took the spring and went down the boat's narrow stairs to the mechanical room. When he returned from fitting the spring into the gearings of the boat's power system, he said, <q>Your springs are shit, all of them. I don't know why you didn't bring bigger ones. We have to rewind, what, every twenty hours? You could have gotten all the way here on a couple of the big ones.</q></p>

<p>Lalji scowled at Creo and jerked his head toward the guard still standing at the top of the riverbank and looking down on them. He lowered his voice. <q>And then what would the MidWest Authority be saying as we are going upriver? All their IP men all over our boat, wondering where we are going so far? Boarding us and then wondering what we are doing with such big springs. Where have we gotten so many joules? Wondering what business we have so far upriver.</q> He shook his head. <q>No, no. This is better. Small boat, small distance, who worries about Lalji and his stupid blond helpboy then? No one. No, this is better.</q></p>

<p><q>You always were a cheap bastard.</q></p>

<p>Lalji glanced at Creo. <q>You are lucky it is not forty years ago. Then you would be paddling up this river by hand, instead of lying on your lazy back letting these fancy kink-springs do the work. Then we would be seeing you use those muscles of yours.</q></p>

<p><q>If I was lucky, I would have been born during the Expansion and we'd still be using gasoline.</q></p>

<p>Lalji was about to retort but an IP boat slashed past them, ripping a deep wake. Creo lunged for their cache of spring guns. Lalji dove after him and slammed the cache shut. <q>They're not after us!</q></p>

<p>Creo stared at Lalji, uncomprehending for a moment, then relaxed. He stepped away from the stored weapons. The IP boat continued upriver, half its displacement dedicated to massive precision kink-springs and the stored joules that gushed from their unlocking molecules. Its curling wake rocked the needleboat. Lalji steadied himself against the rail as the IP boat dwindled to a speck and disappeared between obstructing barge chains.</p>

<p>Creo scowled after the boat. <q>I could have taken them.</q></p>

<p>Lalji took a deep breath. <q>You would have gotten us killed.</q> He glanced at the top of the riverbank to see if the IP man had noticed their panic. He wasn't even visible. Lalji silently gave thanks to Ganesha.</p>

<p><q>I don't like all of them around,</q> Creo complained. <q>They're like ants. Fourteen at the last lock. That one, up on the hill. Now these boats.</q></p>

<p><q>It is the heart of calorie country. It is to be expected.</q></p>

<p><q>You making a lot of money on this trip?</q>
</p>

<p><q>Why should you care?</q></p>

<p><q>Because you never used to take risks like this.</q> Creo swept his arm, indicating the village, the cultivated fields, the muddy width of river gurgling past, and the massive barges clogging it. <q>No one comes this far upriver.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm making enough money to pay you. That's all you should concern yourself with. Now go get the rest of the springs. When you think too much, your brain makes mush.</q></p>

<p>Creo shook his head doubtfully but jumped for the dock and headed up the steps to the kinetic shop. Lalji turned to face the river. He took a deep breath.</p>

<p>The IP boat had been a close call. Creo was too eager to fight. It was only with luck that they hadn't ended up as shredded meat from the IP men's spring guns. He shook his head tiredly, wondering if he had ever had as much reckless confidence as Creo. He didn't think so. Not even when he was a boy. Perhaps Shriram was right. Even if Creo was trustworthy, he was still dangerous.</p>

<p>A barge chain, loaded with TotalNutrient Wheat, slid past. The happy sheaves of its logo smiled across the river's muddy flow, promising <q>A Healthful Tomorrow</q> along with folates, B vitamins, and pork protein. Another IP boat slashed upriver, weaving amongst the barge traffic. Its complement of IP men studied him coldly as they went by. Lalji's skin crawled. Was it worth it? If he thought too much, his businessman's instinct &mdash; bred into him through thousands of years of caste practice &mdash; told him no. But still, there was Gita. When he balanced his debts each year on Diwali, how did he account for all he owed her? How did one pay off something that weighed heavier than all his profits, in all his lifetimes?</p>

<p>The NutriWheat wallowed past, witlessly inviting, and without answers.</p>

<p><q>You wanted to know if there was something that would be worth your trip upriver.</q></p>

<p>Lalji and Shriram had been standing in the winding room of Ganesha Kinetic, watching a misplaced ton of SuperFlavor burn into joules. Shriram's paired megadonts labored against the winding spindles, ponderous and steady as they turned just-consumed calories into kinetic energy and wound the shop's main storage springs.</p>

<p>Priti and Bidi. The massive creatures barely resembled the elephants that had once provided their template DNA. Generippers had honed them to a perfect balance of musculature and hunger for a single purpose: to inhale calories and do terrible labors without complaint. The smell of them was overwhelming. Their trunks dragged the ground.</p>

<p>The animals were getting old, Lalji thought, and on the heels of that thought came another: he, too, was getting old. Every morning he found gray in his mustache. He plucked it, of course, but more gray hairs always sprouted. And now his joints ached in the mornings as well. Shriram's own head shone like polished teak. At some point, he'd turned bald. Fat and bald. Lalji wondered when they had turned into such old men.</p>

<p>Shriram repeated himself, and Lalji shook away his thoughts. <q>No, I am not interested in anything upriver. That is the calorie companies' province. I have accepted that when you scatter my ashes it will be on the Mississippi, and not the holy Ganges, but I am not so eager to find my next life that I wish my corpse to float down from Iowa.</q></p>

<p>Shriram twisted his hands nervously and glanced around. He lowered his voice, even though the steady groan of the spindles was more than enough to drown their sounds. <q>Please, friend, there are people&hellip;who want&hellip;to kill this man.</q></p>

<p><q>And I should care?</q></p>

<p>Shriram made placating motions with his hands. <q>He knows how to make calories. AgriGen wants him, badly. PurCal as well. He has rejected them and their kind. His mind is valuable. He needs someone trustworthy to bring him downriver. No friend of the IP men.</q></p>

<p><q>And just because he is an enemy of AgriGen I should help him? Some former associate of the Des Moines clique? Some ex-calorie man with blood on his hands and you think he will help you make money?</q></p>

<p>Shriram shook his head. <q>You make it sound as if this man is unclean.</q></p>

<p><q>We are talking of generippers, yes? How much morality can he have?</q></p>

<p><q>A geneticist. Not a generipper. Geneticists gave us megadonts.</q> He waved at Priti and Bidi. <q>Me, a livelihood.</q></p>

<p>Lalji turned on Shriram. <q>You take refuge in these semantics, now? You, who starved in Chennai when the Nippon genehack weevil came? When the soil turned to alcohol? Before U-Tex and HiGro and the rest all showed up so conveniently? You, who waited on the docks when the seeds came in, saw them come and then saw them sit behind their fences and guards, waiting for people with the money to buy? What traffic would I have with this sort of people? I would sooner spit on him, this calorie man. Let the PurCal devils have him, I say.</q></p>

<br/>

<p class="first"><span class="start">The town was</span> as Shriram had described it. Cottonwoods and willows tangled the edges of the river and over them, the remains of the bridge, some of it still spanning the river in a hazy network of broken trusses and crumbling supports. Lalji and Creo stared up at the rusting construction, a web of steel and cable and concrete, slowly collapsing into the river.</p>

<p><q>How much do you think the steel would bring?</q> Creo asked.</p>

<p>Lalji filled his cheek with a handful of PestResis sunflower seeds and started cracking them between his teeth. He spit the hulls into the river one by one. <q>Not much. Too much energy to tear it out, then to melt it.</q> He shook his head and spat another hull. <q>A waste to make something like that with steel. Better to use Fast-Gen hardwoods, or WeatherAll.</q></p>

<p><q>Not to cover that distance. It couldn't be done now. Not unless you were in Des Moines, maybe. I heard they burn coal there.</q></p>

<p><q>And they have electric lights that go all night and computers as large as a house.</q> Lalji waved his hand dismissively and turned to finish securing the needleboat. <q>Who needs such a bridge now? A waste. A ferry and a mulie would serve just as well.</q> He jumped ashore and started climbing the crumbling steps that led up from the river. Creo followed.</p>

<p>At the top of the steep climb, a ruined suburb waited. Built to serve the cities on the far side of the river when commuting was common and petroleum cheap, it now sprawled in an advanced state of decay. A junk city built with junk materials, as transient as water, willingly abandoned when the expense of commuting grew too great.</p>

<p><q>What the hell is this place?</q> Creo muttered.</p>

<p>Lalji smiled cynically. He jerked his head toward the green fields across the river, where SoyPRO and HiGro undulated to the horizon. <q>The very cradle of civilization, yes? AgriGen, Midwest Growers Group, PurCal, all of them have fields here.</q></p>

<p><q>Yeah? That excite you?</q></p>

<p>Lalji turned and studied a barge chain as it wallowed down the river below them, its mammoth size rendered small by the height. <q>If we could turn all their calories into traceless joules, we'd be wealthy men.</q></p>

<p><q>Keep dreaming.</q> Creo breathed deeply and stretched. His back cracked and he winced at the sound. <q>I get out of shape when I ride your boat this long. I should have stayed in New Orleans.</q></p>

<p>Lalji raised his eyebrows. <q>You're not happy to be making this touristic journey?</q> He pointed across the river. <q>Somewhere over there, perhaps in those very acres, AgriGen created SoyPRO. And everyone thought they were such wonderful people.</q> He frowned. <q>And then the weevil came, and suddenly there was nothing else to eat.</q></p>

<p>Creo made a face. <q>I don't go for those conspiracy theories.</q></p>

<p><q>You weren't even born when it happened.</q> Lalj turned to lead Creo into the wrecked suburb. <q>But I remember. No such accident had ever happened before.</q></p>

<p><q>Monocultures. They were vulnerable.</q></p>

<p><q>Basmati was no monoculture!</q> Lalji waved his hand back toward the green fields. <q>SoyPRO is monoculture. PurCal is monoculture. Generippers make monoculture.</q></p>

<p><q>Whatever you say, Lalji.</q></p>

<p>Lalji glanced at Creo, trying to tell if the young man was still arguing with him, but Creo was carefully studying the street wreckage and Lalji let the argument die. He began counting streets, following memorized directions.</p>

<p>The avenues were all ridiculously broad and identical, large enough to run a herd of megadonts. Twenty cycle-rickshaws could ride abreast easily, and yet the town had only been a support suburb. It boggled Lalji's mind to consider the scale of life before.</p>

<p>A gang of children watched them from the doorway of a collapsed house. Half its timbers had been removed, and the other half were splintered, rising from the foundation like carcass bones where siding flesh had been stripped away.</p>

<p>Creo showed the children his spring gun and they ran away. He scowled at their departing forms. <q>So what the hell are we picking up here? You got a lead on another antique?</q></p>

<p>Lalji shrugged.</p>

<p><q>Come on. I'm going to be hauling it in a couple minutes anyway. What's with the secrecy?</q></p>

<p>Lalji glanced at Creo. <q>There's nothing for you to haul. &lsquo;It' is a man. We're looking for a man.</q></p>

<p>Creo made a sound of disbelief. Lalji didn't bother responding.</p>

<p>Eventually, they came to an intersection. At its center, an old signal light lay smashed. Around it, the pavement was broken through by grasses gone to seed. Dandelions stuck up their yellow heads. On the far side of the intersection, a tall brick building squatted, a ruin of a civil center, yet still standing, built with better materials than the housing it had served.</p>

<p>A cheshire bled across the weedy expanse. Creo tried to shoot it. Missed.</p>

<p>Lalji studied the brick building. <q>This is the place.</q></p>

<p>Creo grunted and shot at another cheshire shimmer.</p>

<p>Lalji went over and inspected the smashed signal light, idly curious to see if it might have value. It was rusted. He turned in a slow circle, studying the surroundings for anything at all that might be worth taking downriver. Some of the old Expansion's wreckage still had worthy artifacts. He'd found the Conoco sign in such a place, in a suburb soon to be swallowed by SoyPRO, perfectly intact, seemingly never mounted in the open air, never subjected to the angry mobs of the energy Contraction. He'd sold it to an AgriGen executive for more than an entire smuggled cargo of HiGro.</p>

<p>The AgriGen woman had laughed at the sign. She'd mounted it on her wall, surrounded by the lesser artifacts of the Expansion: plastic cups, computer monitors, photos of racing automobiles, brightly colored children's toys. She'd hung the sign on her wall and then stood back and murmured that at one point, it had been a powerful company&hellip;global, even.</p>

<p>Global.</p>

<p>She'd said the word with an almost sexual yearning as she stared up at the sign's ruddy polymers.</p>

<p><i>Global</i>.</p>

<p>For a moment, Lalji had been smitten by her vision: a company that pulled energy from the remotest parts of the planet and sold it far away within weeks of extraction; a company with customers and investors on every continent, with executives who crossed time zones as casually as Lalji crossed the alley to visit Shriram.</p>

<p>The AgriGen woman had hung the sign on her wall like the head of a trophy megadont and in that moment, next to a representative of the most powerful energy company in world, Lalji had felt a sudden sadness at how very diminished humanity had become.</p>

<p>Lalji shook away the memory and again turned slowly in the intersection, seeking signs of his passenger. More cheshires flitted amongst the ruins, their smoky shimmer shapes pulsing across the sunlight and passing into shadows. Creo pumped his spring gun and sprayed disks. A shimmer tumbled to stillness and became a matted pile of calico and blood.</p>

<p>Creo repumped his spring gun. <q>So where is this guy?</q></p>

<p><q>I think he will come. If not today, then tomorrow or the next.</q> Lalji headed up the steps of the civil center and slipped between its shattered doors. Inside, it was nothing but dust and gloom and bird droppings. He found stairs and made his way upward until he found a broken window with a view. A gust of wind rattled the window pane and tugged his mustache. A pair of crows circled in the blue sky. Below, Creo pumped his spring gun and shot more cheshire shimmers. When he hit, angry yowls filtered up. Blood swatches spattered the weedy pavement as more animals fled.</p>

<p>In the distance, the suburb's periphery was already falling to agriculture. Its time was short. Soon the houses would be plowed under and a perfect blanket of SoyPRO would cover it. The suburb's history, as silly and transient as it had been, would be lost, churned under by the march of energy development. No loss, from the standpoint of value, but still, some part of Lalji cringed at the thought of time erased. He spent too much time trying to recall the India of his boyhood to take pleasure in the disappearance. He headed back down the dusty stairs to Creo.</p>

<p><q>See anyone?</q></p>

<p>Lalji shook his head. Creo grunted and shot at another cheshire, narrowly missing. He was good, but the nearly invisible animals were hard targets. Creo pumped his spring gun and fired again. <q>Can't believe how many cheshires there are.</q></p>

<p><q>There is no one to exterminate them.</q></p>

<p><q>I should collect the skins and take them back to New Orleans.</q></p>

<p><q>Not on my boat.</q></p>

<p>Many of the shimmers were fleeing, finally understanding the quality of their enemy. Creo pumped again and aimed at a twist of light further down the street.
</p>

<p>Lalji watched complacently. <q>You will never hit it.</q></p>

<p><q>Watch.</q> Creo aimed carefully.</p>

<p>A shadow fell across them. <q>Don't shoot.</q>
</p>

<p>Creo whipped his spring gun around.</p>

<p>Lalji waved a hand at Creo. <q>Wait! It's him!</q></p>

<p>The new arrival was a skinny old man, bald except for a greasy fringe of gray and brown hair, his heavy jaw thick with gray stubble. Hemp sacking covered his body, dirty and torn, and his eyes had a sunken, knowing quality that unearthed in Lalji the memory of a long-ago sadhu, covered with ash and little else: the tangled hair, the disinterest in his clothing, the distance in the eyes that came from enlightenment. Lalji shook away the memory. This man was no holy man. Just a man, and a generipper, at that.</p>

<p>Creo resighted his spring gun on the distant cheshire. <q>Down south, I get a bluebill for every one I kill.</q></p>

<p>The old man said, <q>There are no bluebills for you to collect here.</q></p>

<p><q>Yeah, but they're pests.</q></p>

<p><q>It's not their fault we made them too perfectly.</q> The man smiled hesitantly, as though testing a facial expression. <q>Please.</q> He squatted down in front of Creo. <q>Don't shoot.</q>
</p>

<p>Lalji placed a hand on Creo's spring gun. <q>Let the cheshires be.</q></p>

<p>Creo scowled, but he let his gun's mechanism unwind with a sigh of releasing energy.</p>

<p>The calorie man said, <q>I am Charles Bowman.</q> He looked at them expectantly, as though anticipating recognition. <q>I am ready. I can leave.</q></p>

<p>Gita was dead, of that Lalji was now sure.</p>

<p>At times, he had pretended that it might not be so. Pretended that she might have found a life, even after he had gone.</p>

<p>But she was dead, and he was sure of it.</p>

<p>It was one of his secret shames. One of the accretions to his life that clung to him like dog shit on his shoes and reduced himself in his own eyes: as when he had thrown a rock and hit a boy's head, unprovoked, to see if it was possible; or when he had dug seeds out of the dirt and eaten them one by one, too starved to share. And then there was Gita. Always Gita. That he had left her and gone instead to live close to the calories. That she had stood on the docks and waved as he set sail, when it was she who had paid his passage price.</p>

<p>He remembered chasing her when he was small, following the rustle of her salwar kameez as she dashed ahead of him, her black hair and black eyes and white, white teeth. He wondered if she had been as beautiful as he recalled. If her oiled black braid had truly gleamed the way he remembered when she sat with him in the dark and told him stories of Arjuna and Krishna and Ram and Hanuman. So much was lost. He wondered sometimes if he even remembered her face correctly, or if he had replaced it with an ancient poster of a Bollywood girl, one of the old ones that Shriram kept in the safe of his winding shop and guarded jealously from the influences of light and air.</p>

<p>For a long time he thought he would go back and find her. That he might feed her. That he would send money and food back to his blighted land that now existed only in his mind, in his dreams, and in half-awake hallucinations of deserts, red and black saris, of women in dust, and their black hands and silver bangles, and their hunger, so many of the last memories of hunger.</p>

<p>He had fantasized that he would smuggle Gita back across the shining sea, and bring her close to the accountants who calculated calorie burn quotas for the world. Close to the calories, as she had said, once so long ago. Close to the men who balanced price stability against margins of error and protectively managed energy markets against a flood of food. Close to those small gods with more power than Kali to destroy the world.</p>

<p>But she was dead by now, whether through starvation or disease, and he was sure of it.</p>

<p>And wasn't that why Shriram had come to him? Shriram who knew more of his history than any other. Shriram who had found him after he arrived in New Orleans, and known him for a fellow countryman: not just another Indian long settled in America, but one who still spoke the dialects of desert villages and who still remembered their country as it had existed before genehack weevil, leafcurl, and root rust. Shriram, who had shared a place on the floor while they both worked the winding sheds for calories and nothing else, and were grateful for it, as though they were nothing but genehacks themselves.</p>

<p>Of course Shriram had known what to say to send him upriver. Shriram had known how much he wished to balance the unbalanceable.</p>

<br/>

<p class="first"><span class="start">They followed</span> Bowman down empty streets and up remnant alleys, winding through the pathetic collapse of termite-ridden wood, crumbling concrete foundations, and rusted rebar too useless to scavenge and too stubborn to erode. Finally, the old man squeezed them between the stripped hulks of a pair of rusted automobiles. On the far side, Lalji and Creo gasped.</p>

<p>Sunflowers waved over their heads. A jungle of broad squash leaves hugged their knees. Dry corn stalks rattled in the wind. Bowman looked back at their surprise, and his smile, so hesitant and testing at first, broadened with unrestrained pleasure. He laughed and waved them onward, floundering through a garden of flowers and weeds and produce, catching his torn hemp cloth on the dried stems of cabbage gone to seed and the cling of cantaloupe vines. Creo and Lalji picked their way through the tangle, wending around purple lengths of eggplants, red orb tomatoes, and dangling orange ornament chiles. Bees buzzed heavily between the sunflowers, burdened with saddlebags of pollen.</p>

<p>Lalji paused in the overgrowth and called after Bowman. <q>These plants. They are not engineered?</q></p>

<p>Bowman paused and came thrashing back, wiping sweat and vegetal debris off his face, grinning. <q>Well, engineered, that is a matter of definition, but no, these are not owned by calorie companies. Some of them are even heirloom.</q> He grinned again. <q>Or close enough.</q></p>

<p><q>How do they survive?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, that.</q> He reached down and yanked up a tomato. <q>Nippon genehack weevils, or curl.111.b, or perhaps cibiscosis bacterium, something like that?</q> He bit into the tomato and let the juice run down his gray bristled chin. <q>There isn't another heirloom planting within hundreds of miles. This is an island in an ocean of SoyPRO and HiGro. It makes a formidable barrier.</q> He studied the garden thoughtfully, took another bite of tomato. <q>Now that you have come, of course, only a few of these plants will survive.</q> He nodded at Lalji and Creo. <q>You will be carrying some infection or another and many of these rarities can only survive in isolation.</q> He plucked another tomato and handed it to Lalji. <q>Try it.</q></p>

<p>Lalji studied its gleaming red skin. He bit into it and tasted sweetness and acid. Grinning, he offered it to Creo, who took a bite and made a face of disgust. <q>I'll stick with SoyPRO.</q> He handed it back to Lalji, who finished it greedily.</p>

<p>Bowman smiled at Lalji's hunger. <q>You're old enough to remember, I think, what food used to be. You can take as much of this as you like, before we go. It will all die anyway.</q> He turned and thrashed again through the garden overgrowth, shoving aside dry corn stalks with crackling authoritative sweeps of his arms.</p>

<p>Beyond the garden a house lay collapsed, leaning as though it had been toppled by a megadont, its walls rammed and buckled. The collapsed roof had an ungainly slant, and at one end, a pool of water lay cool and deep, rippled with water skippers. Scavenged gutter had been laid to sluice rainwater from the roof into the pond.</p>

<p>Bowman slipped around the pool's edge and disappeared down a series of crumbled cellar steps. By the time Lalji and Creo followed him down, he had wound a handlight and its dim bulb was spattering the cellar with illumination as its spring ran its course. He cranked the light again while he searched around, then struck a match and lit a lantern. The wick burned high on vegetable oil.</p>

<p>Lalji studied the cellar. It was sparse and damp. A pair of pallets lay on the broken concrete floor. A computer was tucked against a corner, its mahogany case and tiny screen gleaming, its treadle worn with use. An unruly kitchen was shoved against a wall with jars of grains arrayed on pantry shelves and bags of produce hanging from the ceiling to defend against rodents.</p>

<p>The man pointed to a sack on the ground. <q>There, my luggage.</q></p>

<p><q>What about the computer?</q> Lalji asked.</p>

<p>Bowman frowned at the machine. <q>No. I don't need it.</q></p>

<p><q>But it's valuable.</q></p>

<p><q>What I need, I carry in my head. Everything in that machine came from me. My fat burned into knowledge. My calories pedaled into data analysis.</q> He scowled. <q>Sometimes, I look at that computer and all I see is myself whittled away. I was a fat man once.</q> He shook his head emphatically. <q>I won't miss it.</q></p>

<p>Lalji began to protest but Creo startled and whipped out his spring gun. <q>Someone else is here.</q></p>

<p>Lalji saw her even as Creo spoke: a girl squatting in the corner, hidden by shadow, a skinny, staring, freckled creature with stringy brown hair. Creo lowered his spring gun with a sigh.</p>

<p>Bowman beckoned. <q>Come out, Tazi. These are the men I told you about.</q></p>

<p>Lalji wondered how long she had been sitting in the cellar darkness, waiting. She had the look of a creature who had almost molded with the basement: her hair lank, her dark eyes nearly swallowed by their pupils. He turned on Bowman. <q>I thought there was only you.</q></p>

<p>Bowman's pleased smile faded. <q>Will you go back because of it?</q></p>

<p>Lalji eyed the girl. Was she a lover? His child? A feral adoptee? He couldn't guess. The girl slipped her hand into the old man's. Bowman patted it reassuringly. Lalji shook his head. <q>She is too many. You, I have agreed to take. I prepared a way to carry you, to hide you from boarders and inspections. Her,</q> he waved at the girl, <q>I did not agree to. It is risky to take someone like yourself, and now you wish to compound the danger with this girl? No.</q> He shook his head emphatically. <q>It cannot be done.</q></p>

<p><q>What difference does it make?</q> Bowman asked. <q>It costs you nothing. The current will carry us all. I have food enough for both of us.</q> He went over to the pantry and started to pull down glass jars of beans, lentils, corn, and rice. <q>Look, here.</q></p>

<p>Lalji said, <q>We have more than enough food.</q></p>

<p>Bowman made a face. <q>SoyPRO, I suppose?</q></p>

<p><q>Nothing wrong with SoyPRO,</q> Creo said.</p>

<p>The old man grinned and held up a jar of green beans floating in brine. <q>No. Of course not. But a man likes variety.</q> He began filling his bag with more jars, letting them clink carefully. He caught Creo's snort of disgust and smiled, ingratiating suddenly. <q>For lean times, if nothing else.</q> He dumped more jars of grains into the sack.</p>

<p>Lalji chopped the air with his hand. <q>Your food is not the issue. Your girl is the issue, and she is a risk!</q></p>

<p>Bowman shook his head. <q>No risk. No one is looking for her. She can travel in the open, even.</q></p>

<p><q>No. You must leave her. I will not take her.</q></p>

<p>The old man looked down at the girl, uncertain. She gazed back, extricated her hand from his. <q>I'm not afraid. I can live here still. Like before.</q></p>

<p>Bowman frowned, thinking. Finally, he shook his head. <q>No.</q> He faced Lalji. <q>If she cannot go, then I cannot. She fed me when I worked. I deprived her of calories for my research when they should have gone to her. I owe her too much. I will not leave her to the wolves of this place.</q> He placed his hands on her shoulders and placed her ahead of him, between himself and Lalji.</p>

<p>Creo made a face of disgust. <q>What difference does it make? Just bring her. We've got plenty of space.</q></p>

<p>Lalji shook his head. He and Bowman stared at one another across the cellar. Creo said, <q>What if he gives us the computer? We could call it payment.</q></p>

<p>Lalji shook his head stubbornly. <q>No. I do not care about the money. It is too dangerous to bring her.</q></p>

<p>Bowman laughed. <q>Then why come all this way if you are afraid? Half the calorie companies want to kill me and you talk about risk?</q></p>

<p>Creo frowned. <q>What's he talking about?</q></p>

<p>Bowman's eyebrows went up in surprise. <q>You haven't told your partner about me?</q></p>

<p>Creo looked from Lalji to Bowman and back. <q>Lalji?</q></p>

<p>Lalji took a deep breath, his eyes still locked on Bowman. <q>They say he can break the calorie monopolies. That he can pirate SoyPRO.</q></p>

<p>Creo boggled for a moment. <q>That's impossible!</q></p>

<p>Bowman shrugged. <q>For you, perhaps. But for a knowledgeable man? Willing to dedicate his life to DNA helixes? More than possible. If one is willing to burn the calories for such a project, to waste energy on statistics and genome analysis, to pedal a computer through millions upon millions of cycles. More than possible.</q> He wrapped his arms around his skinny girl and held her to him. He smiled at Lalji. <q>So. Do we have any agreement?</q></p>

<p>Creo shook his head, puzzling. <q>I thought you had a money plan, Lalji, but this.&hellip;</q> He shook his head again. <q>I don't get it. How the hell do we make money off this?</q></p>

<p>Lalji gave Creo a dirty look. Bowman smiled, patiently waiting. Lalji stifled an urge to seize the lantern and throw it in his face, such a confident man, so sure of himself, so loyal.&hellip;</p>

<p>He turned abruptly and headed for the stairs. <q>Bring the computer, Creo. If his girl makes any trouble, we dump them both in the river, and still keep his knowledge.</q></p>

<p>Lalji remembered his father pushing back his thali, pretending he was full when dal had barely stained the steel plate. He remembered his mother pressing an extra bite onto his own. He remembered Gita, watching, silent, and then all of them unfolding their legs and climbing off the family bed, bustling around the hovel, ostentatiously ignoring him as he consumed the extra portion. He remembered roti in his mouth, dry like ashes, and forcing himself to swallow anyway.</p>

<p>He remembered planting. Squatting with his father in desert heat, yellow dust all around them, burying seeds they had stored away, saved when they might have been eaten, kept when they might have made Gita fat and marriageable, his father smiling, saying, <q>These seeds will make hundreds of new seeds and then we will all eat well.</q></p>

<p><q>How many seeds will they make?</q> Lalji had asked.</p>

<p>And his father had laughed and spread his arms fully wide, and seemed so large and great with his big white teeth and red and gold earrings and crinkling eyes as he cried, <q>Hundreds! Thousands if you pray!</q> And Lalji <i>had</i> prayed, to Ganesha and Lakshmi and Krishna and Rani Sati and Ram and Vishnu, to every god he could think of, joining the many villagers who did the same as he poured water from the well over tiny seeds and sat guard in the darkness against the possibility that the precious grains might be uprooted in the night and transported to some other farmer's field.</p>

<p>He sat every night while cold stars turned overhead, watching the seed rows, waiting, watering, praying, waiting through the days until his father finally shook his head and said it was no use. And yet still he had hoped, until at last he went out into the field and dug up the seeds one by one, and found them already decomposed, tiny corpses in his hand, rotted. As dead in his palm as the day he and his father had planted them.</p>

<p>He had crouched in the darkness and eaten the cold dead seeds, knowing he should share, and yet unable to master his hunger and carry them home. He wolfed them down alone, half-decayed and caked with dirt: his first true taste of PurCal.</p>

<p>In the light of early morning, Lalji bathed in the most sacred river of his adopted land. He immersed himself in the Mississippi's silty flow, cleansing the weight of sleep, making himself clean before his gods. He pulled himself back aboard, slick with water, his underwear dripping off his sagging bottom, his brown skin glistening, and toweled himself dry on the deck as he looked across the water to where the rising sun cast gold flecks on the river's rippled surface.</p>

<p>He finished drying himself and dressed in new clean clothes before going to his shrine. He lit incense in front of the gods, placed U-Tex and SoyPRO before the tiny carved idols of Krishna and his lute, benevolent Lakshmi, and elephant-headed Ganesha. He knelt in front of the idols, prostrated himself, and prayed.</p>

<p>They had floated south on the river's current, winding easily through bright fall days and watching as leaves changed and cool weather came on. Tranquil skies had arched overhead and mirrored on the river, turning the mud of the Mississippi's flow into shining blue, and they had followed that blue road south, riding the great arterial flow of the river as creeks and tributaries and the linked chains of barges all crowded in with them and gravity did the work of carrying them south.</p>

<p>He was grateful for their smooth movement downriver. The first of the locks were behind them, and having watched the sniffer dogs ignore Bowman's hiding place under the decking, Lalji was beginning to hope that the trip would be as easy as Shriram had claimed. Nonetheless, he prayed longer and harder each day as IP patrols shot past in their fast boats, and he placed extra SoyPRO before Ganesha's idol, desperately hoping that the Remover of Obstacles would continue to do so.</p>

<p>By the time he finished his morning devotions, the rest of the boat was stirring. Creo came below and wandered into the cramped galley. Bowman followed, complaining of SoyPRO, offering heirloom ingredients that Creo shook off with suspicion. On deck, Tazi sat at the edge of the boat with a fishing line tossed into the water, hoping to snare one of the massive lethargic LiveSalmon that occasionally bumped against the boat's keel in the warm murk of the river.</p>

<p>Lalji unmoored and took his place at the tiller. He unlocked the kink-springs and the boat whirred into the deeper current, stored joules dripping from its precision springs in a steady flow as molecules unlocked, one after another, reliable from the first kink to the last. He positioned the needleboat amongst the wallowing grain barges and locked the springs again, allowing the boat to drift.</p>

<p>Bowman and Creo came back up on deck as Creo was asking, <q>&hellip;you know how to grow SoyPRO?</q></p>

<p>Bowman laughed and sat down beside Tazi. <q>What good would that do? The IP men would find the fields, ask for the licenses, and if none were provided, the fields would burn and burn and burn.</q></p>

<p><q>So what good are you?</q></p>

<p>Bowman smiled and posed a question instead. <q>SoyPRO &mdash; what is its most precious quality?</q></p>

<p><q>It's high calorie.</q></p>

<p>Bowman's braying laughter carried across the water. He tousled Tazi's hair and the pair of them exchanged amused glances. <q>You've seen too many billboards from AgriGen. &lsquo;Energy for the world' indeed, indeed. Oh, AgriGen and their ilk must love you very much. So malleable, so&hellip;tractable.</q> He laughed again and shook his head. <q>No. Anyone can make high calorie plants. What else?</q></p>

<p>Nettled, Creo said, <q>It resists the weevil.</q></p>

<p>Bowman's expression became sly. <q>Closer, yes. Difficult to make a plant that fights off the weevil, the leafcurl rust, the soil bacterium which chew through their roots&hellip; so many blights plague us now, so many beasts assail our plantings, but come now, what, best of all, do we like about SoyPRO? We of AgriGen who &lsquo;provide energy to the world'?</q> He waved at a chain of grain barges slathered with logos for SuperFlavor. <q>What makes SuperFlavor so perfect from a CEO's perspective?</q> He turned toward Lalji. <q>You know, Indian, don't you? Isn't it why you've come all this distance?</q></p>

<p>Lalji stared back at him. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse. <q>It's sterile.</q></p>

<p>Bowman's eyes held Lalji's for a moment. His smile slipped. He ducked his head. <q>Yes. Indeed, indeed. A genetic dead-end. A one-way street. We now pay for a privilege that nature once provided willingly, for just a little labor.</q> He looked up at Lalji. <q>I'm sorry. I should have thought. You would have felt our accountants' optimum demand estimates more than most.</q></p>

<p>Lalji shook his head. <q>You cannot apologize.</q> He nodded at Creo. <q>Tell him the rest. Tell him what you can do. What I was told you can do.</q></p>

<p><q>Some things are perhaps better left unsaid.</q></p>

<p>Lalji was undaunted. <q>Tell him. Tell me. Again.</q></p>

<p>Bowman shrugged. <q>If you trust him, then I must trust him as well, yes?</q> He turned to Creo. <q>Do you know cheshires?</q></p>

<p>Creo made a noise of disgust. <q>They're pests.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, yes. A bluebill for every dead one. I forgot. But what makes our cheshires such pests?</q></p>

<p><q>They molt. They kill birds.</q></p>

<p><q>And?</q> Bowman prodded.</p>

<p>Creo shrugged.</p>

<p>Bowman shook his head. <q class="continued">And to think it was for people like you that I wasted my life on research and my calories on computer cycles.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">You call cheshires a plague, and truly, they are. A few wealthy patrons, obsessed with Lewis Carroll, and suddenly they are everywhere, breeding with heirloom cats, killing birds, wailing in the night, but most importantly, their offspring, an astonishing ninety-two percent of the time, are cheshires themselves, pure, absolute. We create a new species in a heartbeat of evolutionary time, and our songbird populations disappear almost as quickly. A more perfect predator, but most importantly, one that spreads.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">With SoyPRO, or U-Tex, the calorie companies may patent the plants and use intellectual property police and sensitized dogs to sniff out their property, but even IP men can only inspect so many acres. Most importantly, the seeds are sterile, a locked box. Some may steal a little here and there, as you and Lalji do, but in the end, you are nothing but a small expense on a balance sheet fat with profit because no one except the calorie companies can grow the plants.</q></p>

<p><q>But what would happen if we passed SoyPRO a different trait, stealthily, like a man climbing atop his best friend's wife?</q> He waved his arm to indicate the green fields that lapped at the edges of the river. <q>What if someone were to drop bastardizing pollens amongst these crown jewels that surround us? Before the calorie companies harvested and shipped the resulting seeds across the world in their mighty clipper fleets, before the licensed dealers delivered the patented crop seed to their customers. What sorts of seeds might they be delivering then?</q></p>

<p>Bowman began ticking traits off with his fingers. <q>Resistant to weevil and leafcurl, yes. High calorie, yes, of course. Genetically distinct and therefore unpatentable?</q> He smiled briefly. <q>Perhaps. But best of all, fecund. Unbelievably fecund. Ripe, fat with breeding potential.</q> He leaned forward. <q>Imagine it. Seeds distributed across the world by the very cuckolds who have always clutched them so tight, all of those seeds lusting to breed, lusting to produce their own fine offspring full of the same pollens that polluted the crown jewels in the first place.</q> He clapped his hands. <q>Oh, what an infection that would be! And how it would spread!</q></p>

<p>Creo stared, his expression contorting between horror and fascination. <q>You can do this?</q></p>

<p>Bowman laughed and clapped his hands again. <q>I'm going to be the next Johnny Appleseed.</q></p>

<br/>

<p class="first"><span class="start">Lalji woke</span> suddenly. Around him, the darkness of the river was nearly complete. A few windup LED beacons glowed on grain barges, powered by the flow of the current's drag against their ungainly bodies. Water lapped against the sides of the needleboat and the bank where they had tied up. Beside him on the deck the others lay bundled in blankets.</p>

<p>Why had he wakened? In the distance, a pair of village roosters were challenging one another across the darkness. A dog was barking, incensed by whatever hidden smells or sounds caused dogs to startle and defend their territory. Lalji closed his eyes and listened to the gentle undulation of the river, the sounds of the distant village. If he pressed his imagination, he could almost be lying in the early dawn of another village, far away, long ago dissolved.</p>

<p>Why was he awake? He opened his eyes again and sat up. He strained his eyes against the darkness. A shadow appeared on the river blackness, a subtle blot of movement.</p>

<p>Lalji shook Bowman awake, his hand over Bowman's mouth. <q>Hide!</q> he whispered.
</p>

<p>Lights swept over them. Bowman's eyes widened. He fought off his blankets and scrambled for the hold. Lalji gathered Bowman's blankets with his own, trying to obscure the number of sleepers as more lights flashed brightly, sliding across the deck, pasting them like insects on a collection board.</p>

<p>Abandoning its pretense of stealth, the IP boat opened its springs and rushed in. It slammed against the needleboat, pinning it to the shoreline as men swarmed aboard. Three of them, and two dogs.</p>

<p><q>Everyone stay calm! Keep your hands in sight!</q></p>

<p>Handlight beams swept across the deck, dazzlingly bright. Creo and Tazi clawed out of their blankets and stood, surprised. The sniffer dogs growled and lunged against their leashes. Creo backed away from them, his hands held before him, defensive.</p>

<p>One of the IP men swept his handlight across them. <q>Who owns this boat?</q></p>

<p>Lalji took a breath. <q>It's mine. This is my boat.</q> The beam swung back and speared his eyes. He squinted into the light. <q>Have we done something wrong?</q>
</p>

<p>The leader didn't answer. The other IP men fanned out, swinging their lights across the boat, marking the people on deck. Lalji realized that except for the leader, they were just boys, barely old enough to have mustaches and beards at all. Just peachfuzzed boys carrying spring guns and covered in armor that helped them swagger.</p>

<p>Two of them headed for the stairs with the dogs as a fourth jumped aboard from the secured IP boat. Handlight beams disappeared into the bowels of the needleboat, casting looming shadows from inside the stairway. Creo had somehow managed to end up backed against the needleboat's cache of spring guns. His hand rested casually beside the catches. Lalji stepped toward the captain, hoping to head off Creo's impulsiveness.</p>

<p>The captain swung his light on him. <q>What are you doing here?</q></p>

<p>Lalji stopped and spread his hands helplessly. <q>Nothing.</q></p>

<p><q>No?</q></p>

<p>Lalji wondered if Bowman had managed to secure himself. <q>What I mean is that we only moored here to sleep.</q></p>

<p><q>Why didn't you tie up at Willow Bend?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not familiar with this part of the river. It was getting dark. I didn't want to be crushed by the barges.</q> He wrung his hands. <q>I deal with antiques. We were looking in the old suburbs to the north. It's not illeg &mdash;</q> A shout from below interrupted him. Lalji closed his eyes regretfully. The Mississippi would be his burial river. He would never find his way to the Ganges.</p>

<p>The IP men came up dragging Bowman. <q>Look what we found! Trying to hide under the decking!</q></p>

<p>Bowman tried to shake them off. <q>I don't know what you're talking about &mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>Shut up!</q> One of the boys shoved a club into Bowman's stomach. The old man doubled over. Tazi lunged toward them, but the captain corralled her and held her tightly as he flashed his light over Bowman's features. He gasped.</p>

<p><q>Cuff him. We want him. Cover them!</q> Spring guns came up all around. The captain scowled at Lalji. <q>An antiques dealer. I almost believed you.</q> To his men he said, <q>He's a generipper. From a long time ago. See if there's anything else on board. Any disks, any computers, any papers.</q></p>

<p>One of them said, <q>There's a treadle computer below.</q></p>

<p><q>Get it.</q></p>

<p>In moments the computer was on deck. The captain surveyed his captives. <q>Cuff them all.</q> One of the IP boys made Lalji kneel and started patting him down while a sniffer dog growled over them.</p>

<p>Bowman was saying, <q>I'm really very sorry. Perhaps you've made a mistake. Perhaps.&hellip;</q></p>

<p>Suddenly the captain shouted. The IP men's handlights swung toward the sound. Tazi was latched onto the captain's hand, biting him. He was shaking at her as though she were a dog, struggling with his other hand to get his spring gun free. For a brief moment everyone watched the scuffle between the girl and the much larger man. Someone &mdash; Lalji thought it was an IP man &mdash; laughed. Then Tazi was flung free and the captain had his gun out and there was a sharp hiss of disks. Handlights thudded on the deck and rolled, casting dizzy beams of light.
</p>

<p>More disks hissed through the darkness. A rolling light beam showed the captain falling, crashing against Bowman's computer, silver disks embedded in his armor. He and the computer slid backwards. Darkness again. A splash. The dogs howled, either released and attacking or else wounded. Lalji dove and lay prone on the decking as metal whirred past his head.</p>

<p><q>Lalji!</q> It was Creo's voice. A gun skittered across the planking. Lalji scrambled toward the sound.</p>

<p>One of the handlight beams had stabilized. The captain was sitting up, black blood lines trailing from his jaw as he leveled his pistol at Tazi. Bowman lunged into the light, shielding the girl with his body. He curled as disks hit him.</p>

<p>Lalji's fingers bumped the spring gun. He clutched after it blindly. His hand closed on it. He jacked the pump, aimed toward bootfalls, and let the spring gun whir. The shadow of one of the IP men, the boys, was above him, falling, bleeding, already dead as he hit the decking.</p>

<p>Everything went silent.</p>

<p>Lalji waited. Nothing moved. He waited still, forcing himself to breathe quietly, straining his eyes against the shadows where the handlights didn't illuminate. Was he the only one alive?</p>

<p>One by one, the three remaining handlights ran out of juice. Darkness closed in. The IP boat bumped gently against the needleboat. A breeze rustled the willow banks, carrying the muddy reek of fish and grasses. Crickets chirped.</p>

<p>Lalji stood. Nothing. No movement. Slowly he limped across the deck. He'd twisted his leg somehow. He felt for one of the handlights, found it by its faint metallic gleam, and wound it. He played its flickering beam across the deck.</p>

<p>Creo. The big blond boy was dead, a disk caught in his throat. Blood pooled from where it had hit his artery. Not far away, Bowman was ribboned with disks. His blood ran everywhere. The computer was missing. Gone overboard. Lalji squatted beside the bodies, sighing. He pulled Creo's bloodied braids off his face. He had been fast. As fast as he had believed he was. Three armored IP men and the dogs as well. He sighed again.</p>

<p>Something whimpered. Lalji flicked his light toward the source, afraid of what he would find, but it was only the girl, seemingly unhurt, crawling to Bowman's body. She looked up into the glare of Lalji's light, then ignored him and crouched over Bowman. She sobbed, then stifled herself. Lalji locked the handlight's spring and let darkness fall over them.</p>

<p>He listened to the night sounds again, praying to Ganesha that there were no others out on the river. His eyes adjusted. The shadow of the grieving girl kneeling amongst lumped bodies resolved from the blackness. He shook his head. So many dead for such an idea. That such a man as Bowman might be of use. And now such a waste. He listened for signs others had been alerted but heard nothing. A single patrol, it seemed, uncoordinated with any others. Bad luck. That was all. One piece of bad luck breaking a string of good. Gods were fickle.
</p>

<p>He limped to the needleboat's moorings and began untying. Unbidden, Tazi joined him, her small hands fumbling with the knots. He went to the tiller and unlocked the kink-springs. The boat jerked as the screws bit and they swept into the river darkness. He let the springs fly for an hour, wasting joules but anxious to make distance from the killing place, then searched the banks for an inlet and anchored. The darkness was nearly total.</p>

<p>After securing the boat, he searched for weights and tied them around the ankles of the IP men. He did the same with the dogs, then began shoving the bodies off the deck. The water swallowed them easily. It felt unclean to dump them so unceremoniously, but he had no intention of taking time to bury them. With luck, the men would bump along under water, picked at by fish until they disintegrated.</p>

<p>When the IP men were gone, he paused over Creo. So wonderfully quick. He pushed Creo overboard, wishing he could build a pyre for him.</p>

<p>Lalji began mopping the decks, sluicing away the remaining blood. The moon rose, bathing them in pale light. The girl sat beside the body of her chaperone. Eventually, Lalji could avoid her with his mopping no more. He knelt beside her. <q>You understand he must go into the river?</q></p>

<p>The girl didn't respond. Lalji took it as assent. <q>If there is anything you wish to have of his, you should take it now.</q> The girl shook her head. Lalji hesitantly let his hand rest on her shoulder. <q>It is no shame to be given to a river. An honor, even, to go to a river such as this.</q></p>

<p>He waited. Finally, she nodded. He stood and dragged the body to the edge of the boat. He tied it with weights and levered the legs over the lip. The old man slid out of his hands. The girl was silent, staring at where Bowman had disappeared into the water.</p>

<p>Lalji finished his mopping. In the morning he would have to mop again, and sand the stains, but for the time it would do. He began pulling in the anchors. A moment later, the girl was with him again, helping. Lalji settled himself at the tiller. Such a waste, he thought. Such a great waste.</p>

<p>Slowly, the current drew their needleboat into the deeper flows of the river. The girl came and knelt beside him. <q>Will they chase us?</q></p>

<p>Lalji shrugged. <q>With luck? No. They will look for something larger than us to make so many of their men disappear. With just the two of us now, we will look like very small inconsequential fish to them. With luck.</q></p>

<p>She nodded, seeming to digest this information. <q>He saved me, you know. I should be dead now.</q></p>

<p><q>I saw.</q></p>

<p><q>Will you plant his seeds?</q></p>

<p><q>Without him to make them, there will be no one to plant them.</q></p>

<p>Tazi frowned. <q>But we've got so many.</q> She stood and slipped down into the hold. When she returned, she lugged the sack of Bowman's food stores. She began pulling jars from the sack: rice and corn, soybeans and kernels of wheat.</p>

<p><q>That's just food,</q> Lalji protested.</p>

<p>Tazi shook her head stubbornly. <q>They're his Johnny Appleseeds. I wasn't supposed to tell you. He didn't trust you to take us all the way. To take me. But you could plant them, too, right?</q></p>

<p>Lalji frowned and picked up a jar of corn. The kernels nestled tightly together, hundreds of them, each one unpatented, each one a genetic infection. He closed his eyes and in his mind he saw a field: row upon row of green rustling plants, and his father, laughing, with his arms spread wide as he shouted, <q>Hundreds! Thousands if you pray!</q></p>

<p>Lalji hugged the jar to his chest, and slowly, he began to smile.</p>

<p>The needleboat continued downstream, a bit of flotsam in the Mississippi's current. Around it, the crowding shadow hulks of the grain barges loomed, all of them flowing south through the fertile heartland toward the gateway of New Orleans; all of them flowing steadily toward the vast wide world.</p>
