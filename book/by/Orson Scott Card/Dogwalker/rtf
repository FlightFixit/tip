\par I was an innocent pedestrian. Only reason I got in this in the first place was I got a vertical way of thinking and Dogwalker thought I might be useful, which was true, and also he said I might 
enjoy myself, which was a prefabrication, since people done a lot more enjoying on me than I done on them.
\par When I say I think vertical, I mean to say I'm metaphysical, that is, similar, which is to say, I'm dead but my brain don't know it yet and my feet s
till move. I got popped at age nine just lying in my own bed when the goat next door shot at his lady and it went through the wall and into my head. Everybody went to look at them cause they made all the noise, so I was a quart low before anybody noticed 
I been poked.
\par They packed my head with supergoo and light pipe, but they didn't know which neutron was supposed to butt into the next so my alchemical brain got turned from rust to diamond. Goo Boy. The Crystal Kid.
\par From that bright electrical day I never grew another inch, anywhere. Bullet went nowhere near my gonadicals, just turned off the puberty switch in my head. Saint Paul said he was a eunuch for Jesus, but who am I a eunuch for?
\par Worst thing about it is here I am near thirty and I still have to take 
barkeepers to court before they'll sell me beer. And it ain't hardly worth it even though the judge prints out in my favor and the barkeep has to pay costs, because my corpse is so little I get toxed on six ounces and pass out pissing after twelve. I'm a 
lousy drinking buddy. Besides, anybody hangs out with me looks like a pederast.
\par No, I'm not trying to make you drippy-drop for me\emdash I'm used to it, OK? Maybe the homecoming queen never showed me True Love in a four-point spread, but I got this knack that cert
ain people find real handy and so I always made out. I dress good and I ride the worm and I don't pay much income tax. Because I am the Password Man. Give me five minutes with anybody's curriculum vitae, which is to say their autopsychoscopy, and nine tim
e
s out of ten I'll spit out their password and get you into their most nasty sticky sweet secret files. Actually it's usually more like three times out of ten, but that's still a lot better odds than having a computer spend a year trying to push out fiftee
n characters to make just the right P-word, specially since after the third wrong try they string your phone number, freeze the target files, and call the dongs.
\par Oh, do I make you sick? A cute little boy like me, engaged in critical unspecified dispopulativ
e behaviors? I may be half glass and four feet high, but I can simulate you better than your own mama, and the better I know you, the deeper my hooks. I not only know your password now, I can write a word on a paper, seal it up, and then you go home and c
hange your password and then open up what I wrote and there it'll be, your new password, three times out of ten. I am }{\i\fs24 vertical}{\fs24 
, and Dogwalker knowed it. Ten percent more supergoo and I wouldn't even be legally human, but I'm still under the line, which is more than I can say for a lot of people who are a hundred percent zoo inside their head.
\par Dogwalker comes to me one day at Carolina Circlee, where I'm playing pinball standing on a stool. He didn't say nothing, just gave me a shove, so naturally he got my el
bow in his balls. I get a lot of twelve-year-olds trying to shove me around at the arcades, so I'm used to teaching them lessons. Jack the Giant Killer. Hero of the fourth graders. I usually go for the stomach, only Dogwalker wasn't a twelve-year-old, so 
my elbow hit low.
\par I knew the second I hit him that this wasn't no kid. I didn't know Dogwalker from God, but he gots the look, you know, like he been hungry before, and he don't care what he eats these days.
\par Only he got no ice and he got no slice, just sits
 there on the floor with his back up against the Eat Shi'ite game, holding his boodle and looking at me like I was a baby he had to diaper. "I hope you're Goo Boy, " he says, "cause if you ain't, I'm gonna give you back to your mama in three little tupper
ware bowls." He doesn't sound like he's making a threat, though. He sounds like he's chief weeper at his own funeral.
\par "You want to do business, use your mouth, not your hands," I says. Only I say it real apoplectic, which is the same as apologetic except you are also still pissed.
\par "Come with me," he says. "I got to go buy me a truss. You pay the tax out of your allowance."
\par So we went to Ivey's and stood around in children's wear while he made his pitch. "One P-word," he says, "only there can't be no mistake. If there's a mistake, a guy loses his job and maybe goes to jail."
\par So I told him no. Three chances in ten, that's the best I can do. No guarantees. My record speaks for itself, but nobody's perfect, and I ain't even close.
\par "Come on, " he says, "you got to have ways to make sure, right? If you can do three times out of ten, what if you find out more about the guy? What if you meet him?"
\par "OK, maybe fifty-fifty."
\par "Look, we can't go back for seconds. So maybe you can't get it. But do you know when you ain't got it? "
\par "Maybe half the time when I'm wrong, I know I'm wrong."
\par "So we got three out of four that you'll know whether you got it?"
\par "No," says I. "Cause half the time when I'm right, I don't know I'm right."
\par "Shee-it," he says. "This is like doing business with my baby brother."
\par "You can't afford me anyway," I says. "I pull two dimes minimum, and you barely got breakfast on your gold card."
\par "I'm offering a cut."
\par "I don't want a cut. I want cash."
\par "Sure thing," he says. He looks around, real careful. As if they wired the sign that said Boys Briefs Sizes 10-12. "I got an inside man at Federal Coding," he says.
\par "That's nothing," I says. "I got a bug up the First Lady's ass, and forty hours on tape of her breaking wind."
\par I got a mouth: I know I got a mouth. I especially know it when he jams my face into a pile of shorts and says, "Suck on this, Goo Boy."
\par I hate it when people push me around. And I know ways to make them stop. This time all I had to do was cry. Real loud, like he was hurting me. Everybody looks whe
n a kid starts crying. "I'll be good." I kept saying it. "Don't hurt me no more! I'll be good."
\par "Shut up," he says. "Everybody's looking."
\par "Don't you ever shove me around again," I says. "I'm at least ten years older than you, and a hell of a lot more than
 ten years smarter. Now I'm leaving this store, and if I see you coming after me, I'll start screaming about how you zipped down and showed me the pope, and you'll get yourself a child-molesting tag so they pick you up every time some kid gets jollied wit
hin a hundred miles of Greensboro." I've done it before, and it works, and Dogwalker was no dummy. Last thing he needed was extra reasons for the dongs to bring him in for questioning. So I figured he'd tell me to get poked and that'd be the last of it.

\par Instead he says, "Goo Boy, I'm sorry, I'm too quick with my hands."
\par Even the goat who shot me never said he was sorry. My first thought was, what kind of sister is he, abjectifying right out like that. Then I reckoned I'd stick around and see what kind of man
 it is who emulsifies himself in front of a nine-year-old-looking kid. Not that I figured him to be purely sorrowful. He still just wanted me to get the P-word for him, and he knew there wasn't nobody else to do it. But most street pugs aren't smart enoug
h
 to tell the right lie under pressure. Right away I knew he wasn't your ordinary street hook or low arm, pugging cause they don't have the sense to stick with any kind of job. He had a deep face, which is to say his head was more than a hairball, by which
 I mean he had brains enough to put his hands in his pockets without seeking an audience with the pope. Right then was when I decided he was my kind of no-good lying son-of-a-bitch.
\par "What are you after at Federal Coding?" I asked him. "A record wipe?"
\par "Ten clean greens," he says. "Coded for unlimited international travel. The whole ID, just like a real person."
\par "The President has a green card," I says. "The Joint Chiefs have clean greens. But that's all. The U.S. Vice-President isn't even cleared for unlimited international travel."
\par "Yes he is," he says.
\par "Oh, yeah, you know everything."
\par "I need a P. My guy could do us reds and blues, but a clean green has to be done by a burr-oak rat two levels up. My guy knows how it's done."
\par "They won't just have it with a P-word," I says. "A guy who can make green cards, they're going to have his finger on it."
\par "I know how to get the finger," he says. "It takes the finger and the password."
\par "You take a guy's finger, he might report it. And even if you persuade him not to, somebody's gonna notice that it's gone."
\par "Latex," he says. "We'll get a mold. And don't start telling me how to do my part of the job. You get P-words, I get fingers. You in?"
\par "Cash," I says.
\par "Twenty percent," says he.
\par "Twenty percent of pus."
\par "The inside guy gets twenty, the girl who brings me the finger, she gets twenty, and I damn well get forty."
\par "You can't just sell these things on the street, you know."
\par "They're worth a meg apiece," says he, "to certain buyers." By which he meant Orkish Crime, of course. Sell ten, and my twenty percent grows up to be two megs. Not enough to be rich, but enough to retire from public life\emdash 
and maybe even pay for some high-level medicals to sprout hair on my face. I got to admit that sounded good to me.
\par So we went into busi
ness. For a few hours he tried to do it without telling me the baroque rat's name, just giving me data he got from his guy at Federal Coding. But that was real stupid, giving me secondhand face like that, considering he needed me to be a hundred percent s
u
re, and pretty soon he realized that and brought me in all the way. He hated telling me anything, because he couldn't stand to let go. Once I knew stuff on my own, what was to stop me from trying to go into business for myself? But unless he had another w
a
y to get the P-word, he had to get it from me, and for me to do it right, I had to know everything I could. Dogwalker's got a brain, in his head, even if it is all biodegradable, and so he knows there's times when you got no choice but to trust somebody. 
When you just got to figure they'll do their best even when they're out of your sight.
\par He took me to his cheap condo on the old Guilford College campus, near the worm, which was real congenital for getting to Charlotte or Winston or Raleigh with no fuss. He
 didn't have no soft floor, just a bed, but it was a big one, so I didn't reckon he suffered. Maybe he bought it back in his old pimping days, I figured, back when he got his name, running a string of bitches with names like Spike and Bowser and Prince, r
e
al hydrant leg-lifters for the tweeze trade. I could see that he used to have money, and he didn't anymore. Lots of great clothes, tailor-tight fit, but shabby, out of sync. The really old ones, he tore all the wiring out, but you could still see where th
e diodes used to light up. We're talking neanderthal.
\par "Vanity, vanity, all is profanity," says I, while I'm holding out the sleeve of a camisa that used to light up like an airplane coming in for a landing.
\par "They're too comfortable to get rid of," he says. But there's a twist in his voice so I know he don't plan to fool nobody.
\par "Let this be a lesson to you," says I. "This is what happens when a walker don't walk."
\par "Walkers do steady work, " says he. "But me, when business was good, it felt bad, and when business was bad, it felt good. You walk cats, maybe you can take some pride in it. But you walk dogs, and you know they're getting hurt every time\emdash "
\par "They got a built-in switch, they don't feel a thing. That's why the dongs don't touch you, walking dogs, cause nobody gets hurt."
\par "Yeah, so tell me, which is worse, somebody getting tweezed till they scream so some old honk can pop his pimple, or somebody getting half their brain replaced so when the old honk tweezes her she can't feel a thing? I had these women'
s bodies around me and I knew that they used to be people."
\par "You can be glass," says I, "and still be people."
\par He saw I was taking it personally. "Oh, hey," says he, "you're under the line."
\par "So are dogs," says I.
\par "Yeah well," says he. "You watch a girl come back and tell about some of the things they done to her, and she's laughing, you draw your own line."
\par I look around his shabby place. "Your choice," says I.
\par "I wanted to feel clean," says he. "That don't mean I got to stay poor."
\par "So you're setting up this grope so you can return to the old days of peace and propensity."
\par "Propensity," says he. "What the hell kind of word is that? Why do you keep using words like that?"
\par "Cause I know them," says I.
\par "Well you }{\i\fs24 don't}{\fs24  know them," says he, "because half the time you get them wrong."
\par }\pard\plain \s17\fi432\sa60\widctlpar\adjustright \cgrid 
I showed him my best little-boy grin. "I know," says I. What I don't tell him is that the fun comes from the fact that almost nobody ever knows I'm using them wrong. Dogwalker's no ordinary pimp. But then the ordinary pimp doesn't b
ench himself halfway through the game because of a sprained moral qualm, by which I mean that Dogwalker had some stray diagonals in his head, and I began to think it might be fun to see where they all hooked up.
\par \pard\plain \fi432\sa60\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\cgrid {\fs24 Anyway, we got down to business. The target's name was Jesse H. Hunt, and I did a real job on him. The Crystal Kid really plugged in on this one. Dogwalker had about two pages of stuff
\emdash date of birth, place of birth, sex at birth (no changes since), education, employment history. It was like getting 
an armload of empty boxes. I just laughed at it. "You got a jack to the city library?" I asked him, and he shows me the wall outlet. I plugged right in, visual onto my pocket sony, with my own little crystal head for ee-i-ee-i-oh. Not every goo-head can t
hink clear enough to do this, you know, put out clean type just by thinking the right stuff out my left ear interface port.
\par I showed Dogwalker a little bit about research. Took me ten minutes. I know my way right through the Greensboro Public Library. I hav
e P-words for every single librarian and I'm so ept that they don't even guess I'm stepping upstream through their access channels. From the Public Library you can get all the way into North Carolina Records Division in Raleigh, and from there you can jum
b
le into federal personnel records anywhere in the country. Which meant that by nightfall on that most portentous day we had hardcopy of every document in Jesse H. Hunt's whole life, from his birth certificate and first grade report card to his medical his
tory and security clearance reports when he first worked for the feds.
\par Dogwalker knew enough to be impressed. "If you can do all that," he says, "you might as well pug his P-word straight out."
\par "}{\i\fs24 No puedo}{\fs24 , putz," says I as cheerful as can be. "Think of the fed as a castle. Personnel files are floating in the moat\emdash 
there's a few alligators but I swim real good. Hot data is deep in the dungeon. You can get in there, but you can't get out clean. And P-words\emdash P-words are kept up the queen's ass."
\par "No system is unbeatable," he says.
\par "Where'd you learn that, from graffiti in a toilet stall? if the P-word system was even a little bit breakable, Dogwalker, the gentlemen you plan to sell these cards to would already be inside looking out at us, and they wouldn't need to 
spend a meg to get clean greens from a street pug."
\par Trouble was that after impressing Dogwalker with all the stuff I could find out about Jesse H., I didn't know that much more than before. Oh, I could guess at some P-words, but that was all it was\emdash guessin
g. I couldn't even pick a P most likely to succeed. Jesse was one ordinary dull rat. Regulation good grades in school, regulation good evaluations on the job, probably gave his wife regulation lube jobs on a weekly schedule.
\par "You don't really think your girl's going to get his finger," says I with sickening scorn.
\par "You don't know the girl," says he. "If we needed his flipper she'd get molds in five sizes."
\par "You don't know this guy," says I. "This is the straightest opie in Mayberry. I don't see him cheating on his wife."
\par "Trust me," says Dogwalker. "She'll get his finger so smooth he won't even know she took the mold."
\par I didn't believe him. I got a knack for knowing things about people, and Jesse H. wasn't faking. Unless he started faking when he was five, w
hich is pretty unpopulated. He wasn't going to bounce the first pretty girl who made his zipper tight. Besides which he was smart. His career path showed that he was always in the right place. The right people always seemed to know his name. Which is to s
ay he isn't the kind whose brain can't run if his jeans get hot. I said so.
\par "You're really a marching band," says Dogwalker. "You can't tell me his P-word, but you're obliquely sure that he's a limp or a wimp."
\par "Neither one," says I. "He's hard and straight
. But a girl starts rubbing up to him, he isn't going to think it's because she heard that his crotch is cantilevered. He's going to figure she wants something and he'll give her string till he finds out what."
\par He just grinned at me. "I got me the best Password Man in the Triass, didn't I? I got me a miracle worker named Goo-Boy, didn't I? The ice-brain they call Crystal Kid. I got him, didn't I?"
\par "Maybe," says I.
\par "I got him or I kill him," he says, showing more teeth than a primate's supposed to have.
\par "You got me," says I. "But don't go thinking you can kill me."
\par He just laughs. "I got you and you're so good, you can bet I got me a girl who's at least as good at what she does."
\par "No such," says I.
\par "Tell me his P-word and then I'll be impressed."
\par "You want quick results? Then go ask him to give you his password himself."
\par Dogwalker isn't one of those guys who can hide it when he's mad. "I want quick results," he says. "And if I start thinking you can't deliver, I'll pull your tongue out of your head. Through your nose."
\par "Oh, that's good," says I. "I always do my best thinking when I'm being physically threatened by a client. You really know how to bring out the best in me."
\par "I don't want to bring out the best," he says. "I just want to bring out his password."
\par "I got to meet him first," says I.
\par He leans over me so I can smell his musk, which is to say I'm very olfactory and so I can tell you he reeked of testosterone, by which I mean ladies could fill up with babies just from sniffing his sweat. "Meet him?" he as
ks me. "Why don't we just ask him to fill out a job application?"
\par "I've read all his job applications," says I.
\par "How's a glass-head like you going to meet Mr. Fed? " says he. "I bet you're always getting invitations to the same parties as guys like him."
\par "I don't get invited to grown-up parties," says I. "But on the other hand, grown-ups don't pay much attention to sweet little kids like me."
\par He sighed. "You really have to meet him?"
\par "Unless fifty-fifty on a P-word is good enough odds for you."
\par All of a sud
den he goes nova. Slaps a glass off the table and it breaks against the wall, and then he kicks the table over, and all the time I'm thinking about ways to get out of there unkilled. But it's me he's doing the show for, so there's no way I'm leaving, and 
he leans in close to me and screams in my face. "That's the last of your fifty-fifty and sixty-forty and three times in ten I want to hear about, Goo Boy, you hear me?"
\par And I'm talking real meek and sweet, cause this boy's twice my size and three times my w
eight and I don't exactly have no leverage. So I says to him, "I can't help talking in odds and percentages, Dogwalker, I'm vertical, remember? I've got glass channels in here, they spit out percentages as easy as other people sweat."
\par He slapped his hand against his own head. "This ain't exactly a sausage biscuit, either, but you know and I know that when you give me all them exact numbers it's all guesswork anyhow. You don't know the odds on this beakrat anymore than I do."
\par "I don't know the odds on him, W
alker, but I know the odds on me. I'm sorry you don't like the way I sound so precise, but my crystal memory has every P-word I ever plumbed, which is to say I can give you exact to the third decimal percentages on when I hit it right on the first try aft
e
r meeting the subject, and how many times I hit it right on the first try just from his curriculum vitae, and right now if I don't meet him and I go on just what I've got here you have a 48.838 percent chance I'll be right on my P-word first time and a 66
.667 chance I'll be right with one out of three."
\par Well that took him down, which was fine I must say because he loosened up my sphincters with that glass-smashing table-tossing hot-breath-in-my-face routine he did. He stepped back and put his hands in his p
ockets and leaned against the wall. "Well I chose the right P-man, then, didn't I," he says, but he doesn't smile, no, he says the back-down words but his eyes don't back down, his eyes say don't try to flash my face because I see through you, I got most 
e
xcellent inward shades all polarized to keep out your glitz and see you straight and clear. I never saw eyes like that before. Like he knew me. Nobody ever knew me, and I didn't think he really knew me either, but I didn't like him looking at me as if he 
thought he knew me cause the fact is I didn't know me all that well and it worried me to think he might know me better than I did, if you catch my drift.
\par "All I have to do is be a little lost boy in a store," I says.
\par "What if he isn't the kind who helps little lost boys?"
\par "Is he the kind who lets them cry?"
\par "I don't know. What if he is? What then? Think you can get away with meeting him a second time? "
\par "So the lost boy in the store won't work. I can crash my bicycle on his front lawn. I can try to sell him cable magazines."
\par But he was ahead of me already. "For the cable magazines he slams the door in your face, if he even comes to the door at all. For the bicycle crash, you're out of your little glass brain. I got my inside girl working on him right now, ver
y complicated, because he's not the playing around kind, so she has to make this a real emotional come-on, like she's breaking up with a boyfriend and he's the only shoulder she can cry on, and his wife is so lucky to have a man like him. This much he can
 
believe. But then suddenly he has this little boy crashing in his yard, and because he's paranoid, he begins to wonder if some weird rain isn't falling, right? I know he's paranoid because you don't get to his level in the fed without you know how to watc
h behind you and kill the enemy even before they know they're out to get you. So he even suspects, for one instant, that somebody's setting him up for something and what does he do?"
\par I knew what Dogwalker was getting at now, and he was right, and so I let him have his victory and I let the words he wanted march out all in a row. "He changes all his passwords, all his habits, and watches over his shoulder all the time."
\par "And my little project turns into compost. No clean greens."
\par So I saw for the first time w
hy this street boy, this ex-pimp, why he was the one to do this job. He wasn't vertical like me, and he didn't have the inside hook like his fed boy, and he didn't have bumps in his sweater so he couldn't do the girl part, but he had eyes in his elbows, e
ars in his knees, by which I mean he noticed everything there was to notice and then he thought of a few things that weren't even noticeable yet and noticed them. He earned his forty percent. And he earned part of my twenty, too.
\par Now while we waited around 
for the girl to fill Jesse's empty aching arms and get a finger off him, and while we were still working on how to get me to meet him slow and easy and sure, I spent a lot of time with Dogwalker. Not that he ever asked me, but I found myself looping his b
u
s route every morning till he picked me up, or I'd be eating at Bojangle's when he came in to throw cajun chicken down into his ulcerated organs. I watched to make sure he didn't mind, cause I didn't want to piss this boy, having once beheld the majesty o
f his wrath, but if he wanted to shiver me he gave me no shiv.
\par Even after a few days, when the ghosts of the cold hard street started haunting us, he didn't shake me, and that includes when Bellbottom says to him, "Looks like you stopped walking dogs. Now y
ou pimping little boys, right? Little catamites, we call you Catwalker now, that so? Or maybe you just keep him for private use, is that it? You be Boypoker now?" Well like I always said, someday somebody's going to kill Bellbottom just to flay him and us
e
 his skin for a convertible roof, but Dogwalker just waved and walked on by while I made little pissy bumps at Bell. Most people shake me right off when they start getting splashed on about liking little boys, but Doggy, he didn't say we were friends or n
o
thing, but he didn't give me no Miami howdy, neither, which is to say I didn't find myself floating in the Bermuda Triangle with my ass pulled down around my ankles, by which I mean he wasn't ashamed to be seen with me on the street, which don't sound lik
e a six-minute orgasm to you but to me it was like a breeze in August, I didn't ask for it and I don't trust it to last but as long as it's there I'm going to like it.
\par How I finally got to meet Jesse H. was dervish, the best I ever thought of. Which made me
 wonder why I never thought of it before, except that I never before had Dogwalker like a parrot saying "Stupid idea" every time I thought of something. By the time I finally got a plan that he didn't say "stupid idea," I was almost drowned in the deepest
 lightholes of my lucidity. I mean I was going at a hundred watts by the time I satisfied him.
\par First we found out who did babysitting for them when Jesse H. and Mrs. Jesse went out on the town (which for Nice People in G-boro means walking around the mall w
ishing there was something to do and then taking a piss in the public john). They had two regular teenage girls who usually came over and ignored their children for a fee, but when these darlettes were other-wise engaged, which meant they had a contract t
o
 get squeezed and poked by some half-zipped boy in exchange for a hambuger and a vid, they called upon Mother Hubbard's Homecare Hotline. So I most carefully assimilated myself into Mother Hubbard's estimable organization by passing myself off as a lament
a
bly prepubic fourteen-year-old, specializing in the northwest section of town and on into the county. All this took a week, but Walker was in no hurry. Take the time to do it right, he said, if we hurry somebody's going to notice the blur of motion and lo
ok our way and just by looking at us they'll undo us. A horizontal mind that boy had.
\par Came a most delicious night when the Hunts went out to play, and both their diddle-girls were busy being squeezed most delectably (and didn't we have a lovely time persuad
ing two toddle-boys to do the squeezing that very night). This news came to Mr. and Mrs. Jesse at the very last minute, and they had no choice but to call Mother Hubbard's, and isn't it lovely that just a half hour before, sweet little Stevie Queen, being
 
moi, called in and said that he was available for baby-stomping after all. Ein and ein made zwei, and there I was being dropped off by a Mother Hubbard driver at the door of the Jesse Hunt house, whereupon I not only got to look upon the beatific face of 
M
r. Fed himself, I also got to have my dear head patted by Mrs. Fed, and then had the privilege of preparing little snacks for fussy Fed Jr. and foul-mouthed Fedene, the five-year-old and the three-year-old, while Microfed, the one-year-old (not yet human 
and, if I am any judge of character, not likely to live long enough to become such) sprayed uric acid in my face while I was diapering him. A good time was had by all.
\par Because of my heroic efforts, the small creatures were in their truckle beds quite early,
 and being a most fastidious baby-tucker, I browsed the house looking for burglars and stumbling, quite by chance, upon the most useful information about the beakrat whose secret self-chosen name I was trying to learn. For one thing, he had set a watchful
 
hair upon each of his bureau drawers, so that if I had been inclined to steal, he would know that unlawful access of his drawers had been attempted. I learned that he and his wife had separate containers of everything in the bathroom, even when they used 
t
he same brand of toothpaste, and it was he, not she, who took care of all their prophylactic activities (and not a moment too soon, thought I, for I had come to know their children). He was not the sort to use lubrificants or little pleasure-giving ribs, 
either. Only the regulation government-issue hard-as-concrete rubber rafts for him, which suggested to my most pernicious mind that he had almost as much fun between the sheets as me.
\par I learned all kinds of joyful information, all of it trivial, all of it v
ital. I never know which of the threads I grasp are going to make connections deep within the lumens of my brightest caves. But I never before had the chance to wander unmolested through a person's own house when searching for his P-word. I saw the notes 
h
is children brought home from school, the magazines his family received, and more and more I began to see that Jesse H. Hunt barely touched his family at any point. He stood like a waterbug on the surface of life, without ever getting his feet wet. He cou
l
d die, and if nobody tripped over the corpse it would be weeks before they noticed. And yet this was not because he did not care. It was because he was so very very careful. He examined everything but through the wrong end of the microscope, so that it al
l became very small and far away. I was a sad little boy by the end of that night, and I whispered to Microfed that he should practice pissing in male faces, because that's the only way he would ever sink a hook into his daddy's face.
\par "What if he wants to t
ake you home?" Dogwalker asked me, and I said, "No way he would, nobody does that," but Dogwalker made sure I had a place to go all the same, and sure enough, it was Doggy who got voltage and me who went limp. I ended up riding in a beak-rat buggy, a genu
i
ne made-in-America rattletrap station wagon, and he took me to the for-sale house where Mama Pimple was waiting crossly for me and made Mr. Hunt go away because he kept me out too late. Then when the door was closed Mama Pimple giggled her gig and chuckle
d
 her chuck, and Walker himself wandered out of the back room and said, "That's one less favor you owe me, Mama Pimple," and she said, "No, my dear boy-oh, that's one more favor you owe me" and then they kissed a deep passionate kiss if you can believe it.
 Did you imagine anybody ever kissed Mama Pimple that way? Dogwalker is a boyful of shocks.
\par "Did you get all you needed?" he asks me.
\par "I have P-words dancing upward," says I, "and I'll have a name for you tomorrow in my sleep."
\par "Hold onto it and don't tell me," says Dogwalker. "I don't want to hear a name until after we have his finger."
\par That magical day was only hours away, because the girl\emdash whose name I never knew and whose face I never saw\emdash was to cast her spell over Mr. Fed the very next day. As Dogwalker 
said, this was no job for lingeree. The girl did not dress pretty and pretended to be lacking in the social graces, but she was a good little clerical who was going through a most distressing period in her private life, because she had undergone a prematu
r
e hysterectomy, poor lass, or so she told Mr. Fed, and here she was losing her womanhood and she had never really felt like a woman at all. But he was so kind to her, for weeks he had been so kind, and Dogwalker told me afterward how he locked the door of
 
his office for just a few minutes, and held her and kissed her to make her feel womanly, and once his fingers had all made their little impressions on the thin electrified plastic microcoating all over her lovely naked back and breasts, she began to cry a
n
d most gratefully informed him that she did not want him to be unfaithful to his wife for her sake, that he had already given her such a much of a lovely gift by being so kind and understanding, and she felt better thinking that a man like him could bear 
t
o touch her knowing she was defemmed inside, and now she thought she had the confidence to go on. A very convincing act, and one calculated to get his hot naked handprints with out giving him a crisis of conscience that might change his face and give him 
a whole new set of possible Ps.
\par The microsheet got all his fingers from several angles, and so Walker was able to dummy out a finger mask for our inside man within a single night. Right index. I looked at it most skeptically, I fear, because I had my doubts
 already dancing in the little lightpoints of my inmost mind. "Just one finger?"
\par "All we get is one shot," said Dogwalker. "One single try."
\par "But if he makes a mistake, if my first password isn't right, then he could use the middle finger on the second try."
\par "Tell me, my vertical pricket, whether you think Jesse H. Hunt is the sort of burr oak rat who makes mistakes?"
\par To which I had to answer that he was not, and yet I had my misgivings and my misgivings all had to do with needing a second finger, and yet I
 am vertical, not horizontal, which means that I can see the present as deep as you please but the future's not mine to see, que sera, sera.
\par From what Doggy told me, I tried to imagine Mr. Fed's reaction to this nubile flesh that he had pressed. If he had 
poked as well as peeked, I think it would have changed his P-word, but when she told him that she would not want to compromise his uncompromising virtue, it reinforced him as a most regular or even regulation fellow and his name remained pronouncedly the 
same, and his P-word also did not change.
\par "InvictusXYZrwr," quoth I, to Dogwalker, for that was his veritable password, I knew it with more certainty than I had ever had before.
\par "Where in hell did you come up with that?" says he.
\par "If I knew how I did it, Walker, I'd never miss at all," says I. "I don't even know if it's in the goo or in the zoo. All the facts go down, and it all gets mixed around, and up come all these dancing P-words, little pieces of P."
\par "Yeah, but you don't just make it up, what does it mean?"
\par "Invictus is an old poem in a frame stuck in his bureau drawer, which his mama gave him when he was still a little fed-to-be. XYZ is his idea of randomizing, and rwr is the first U.S. President that he admired. I don't know why he chose these words n
ow. Six weeks ago he was using a different P-word with a lot of numbers in it, and six weeks from now he'll change again, but right now\emdash "
\par "Sixty percent sure?" asked Doggy.
\par "I give no percents this time," says I. "I've never roamed through the bathroom of my subject before. But this or give me an assectomy, I've never been more sure."
\par Now that he had the P-word, the inside guy began to wear his magic finger every day, looking for chance to be alone in Mr. Fed's office. He had already created the preliminary
 files, like any routine green card requests, and buried them within his work area.
\par All he needed was to go in, sign on as Mr. Fed, and then if the system accepted his name and P-word and finger, he could call up the files, approve them, and be gone within a minute. But he had to have that minute.
\par And on that wonderful magical day he had it. Mr. Fed had a meeting and his secretary sprung a leak a day early, and in went Inside Man with a perfectly legitimate note to leave for Hunt. He sat before the terminal
, typed name and P-word and laid down his phony finger, and the machine spread wide its lovely legs and bid him enter. He had the files processed in forty seconds, laying down his finger for each green, then signed off and went on out. No sign, no sound t
hat anything was wrong. As sweet as summertime, as smooth as ice, and all we had to do was sit and wait for green cards to come in the mail.
\par "Who you going to sell them to?" says I.
\par "I offer them to no one till I have clean greens in my hand," says he. Because Dogwalker is careful. What happened was not because he was not careful.
\par Every day we walked to the ten places where the envelopes were supposed to come. We knew they wouldn't be there for a week\emdash the wheels of government grind exceeding slow, for good o
r ill. Every day we checked with Inside Man, whose name and face I have already given you, much good it will do, since both are no doubt different by now. He told us every time that all was the same, nothing was changed, and he was telling the truth, for 
the fed was most lugubrious and palatial and gave no leaks that anything was wrong. Even Mr. Hunt himself did not know that aught was amiss in his little kingdom.
\par Yet even with no sign that I could name, I was jumpy every morning and sleepless every night. 
"You walk like you got to use the toilet," says Walker to me, and it is verily so. Something is wrong, I say to myself, something is most deeply wrong, but I cannot find the name for it even though I know and so I say nothing or I lie to myself and try to
 invent a reason for my fear. "It's my big chance," says I. "To be twenty percent of rich."
\par "Rich," says he, "not just a fifth."
\par "Then you'll be double rich."
\par And he just grins at me, being the strong and silent type.
\par "But then\emdash why don't you sell nine," says I, "and keep the other green? Then you'll have the money to pay for it, and the green to go where you want in all the world."
\par But he just laughs at me and says, "Silly boy, my dear sweet pinheaded lightbrained little friend. If someone sees a pimp like me passing a green, he'll tell a fed, because he'll know there's been a mistake. Greens don't go to boys like me."
\par "But you won't be dressed like a pimp," says I, "and you won't stay in pimp hotels."
\par "I'm a low-class pimp," he says again, "and so however I dress that day, that's just the way pimps dress. And whatever hotel I go to, that's a low-class pimp hotel until I leave."
\par "Pimping isn't some disease," says I. "It isn't in your gonads and it isn't in your genes. If your daddy was a Kroc and your mama was an Iacocca, you wouldn't be a pimp."
\par "The hell I wouldn't," says he. "I'd just be a high-class pimp, like my mama and my daddy. Who do you think gets green cards? You can't sell no virgins on the street."
\par I thought that he was wrong and I still do. If any
body could go from low to high in a week, it's Dogwalker. He could be anything and do anything, and that's the truth. Or almost anything. If he could do anything then his story would have a different ending. But it was not his fault. Unless you blame pigs
 because they can't fly. I was the vertical one, wasn't I? I should have named my suspicions and we wouldn't have passed those greens.
\par I held them in my hands, there in his little room, all ten of them when he spilled them on the bed. To celebrate he jumped
 up so high he smacked his head on the ceiling again and again, which made them ceiling tiles dance and flip over and spill dust all over the room. "I flashed just one, a single one," says he, "and a cool million was what he said, and then I said what if 
ten? And he laughs and says fill in the check yourself. "
\par "We should test them," says I.
\par "We can't test them," he says. "The only way to test it is to use it, and if you use it then your print and face are in its memory forever and so we could never sell it."
\par "Then sell one, and make sure it's clean."
\par "A package deal," he says. "If I sell one, and they think I got more by I'm holding out to raise the price, then I may not live to collect for the other nine, because I might have an accident and lose these lit
tle babies. I sell all ten tonight at once, and then I'm out of the green card business for life."
\par But more than ever that night I am afraid, he's out selling those greens to those sweet gentlebodies who are commonly referred to as Organic Crime, and there
 I am on his bed, shivering and dreaming because I know that something will go most deeply wrong but I still don't know what and I still don't know why. I keep telling myself, You're only afraid because nothing could ever go so right for you, you can't be
l
ieve that anything could ever make you rich and safe. I say this stuff so much that I believe that I believe it, but I don't really, not down deep, and so I shiver again and finally I cry, because after all my body still believes I'm nine, and nine-year-o
lds have tear ducts very easy of access, no password required.
\par Well he comes in late that night, and I'm asleep he thinks. And so he walks quiet instead of dancing, but I can hear the dancing in his little sounds, I know he has the money all safely in the b
ank, and so when he leans over to make sure if I'm asleep, I say, "Could I borrow a hundred thou?"
\par So he slaps me and he laughs and dances and sings, and I try to go along you bet I do, I know I should be happy, but then at the end he says, "You just can't
 take it, can you? You just can't handle it," and then I cry all over again, and he just puts his arm around me like a movie dad and gives me play punches on the head and says, "I'm gonna marry me a wife, I am, maybe even Mama Pimple herself, and we'll ad
opt you and have a little Spielberg family in Summerfield, with a riding mower on a real grass lawn."
\par "I'm older than you or Mama Pimple," says I, but he just laughs. Laughs and hugs me until he thinks that I'm all right. Don't go home, he says to me that n
ight, but home I got to go, because I know I'll cry again, from fear or something anyway, and I don't want him to think his cure wasn't permanent. "No thanks," says I, but he just laughs at me. "Stay here and cry all you want to, Goo Boy, but don't go hom
e
 tonight. I don't want to be alone tonight, and sure as hell you don't either." And so I slept between his sheets, like with a brother, him punching and tickling and pinching and telling dirty jokes about his whores, the most good and natural night I spen
t
 in all my life, with a true friend, which I know you don't believe, snickering and nickering and ickering your filthy little thoughts, there was no holes plugged that night because nobody was out to take pleasure from nobody else, just Dogwalker being ha
ppy and wanting me not to be so sad.
\par And after he was asleep, I wanted so bad to know who it was he sold them to, so I could call them up and say, "Don't use those greens, cause they aren't clean. I don't know how, I don't know why, but the feds are onto th
is, I know they are, and if you use those cards they'll nail your fingers to your face."
\par But if I called would they believe me? They were careful too. Why else did it take a week? They had one of their nothing goons use a card to make sure it had no squeak
s or leaks, and it came up clean. Only then did they give the cards to seven big boys, with two held in reserve. Even Organic Crime, the All-seeing Eye, passed those cards same as we did.
\par I think maybe Dogwalker was a little bit vertical too. I think he kn
ew same as me that something was wrong with this. That's why he kept checking back with the inside man, cause he didn't trust how good it was. That's why he didn't spend any of his share. We'd sit there eating the same old schlock, out of his cut from som
e
 leg job or my piece from a data wipe, and every now and then held say, "Rich man's food sure tastes good." Or maybe even though he wasn't vertical he still thought maybe I was right when I thought something was wrong. Whatever he thought, though, it just
 kept getting worse and worse for me, until the morning when we went to see the inside man and the inside man was gone.
\par Gone clean. Gone like he never existed. His apartment for rent, cleaned out floor to ceiling. A phone call to the fed, and he was on vaca
tion, which meant they had him, he wasn't just moved to another house with his newfound wealth. We stood there in his empty place, his shabby empty hovel that was ten times better than anywhere we ever lived, and Doggy says to me, real quiet, he says, "Wh
at was it? What did I do wrong? I thought I was like Hunt, I thought I never made a single mistake in this job, in this one job."
\par And that was it, right then I knew. Not a week before, not when it would do any good. Right then I finally knew it all, knew wh
at Hunt had done. Jesse Hunt never made mistakes. But he was also so paranoid that he haired his bureau to see if the babysitter stole from him. So even though he would never accidentally enter the wrong P-word, he was just the kind who would do it on pur
pose. "He double-fingered every time," I says to Dog. "He's so damn careful he does his password wrong the first time every time, and then comes in on his second finger."
\par "So one time he comes in on the first try, so what?" He says this because he doesn't know computers like I do, being half-glass myself.
\par "The system knew the pattern, that's what. Jesse H. is so precise he never changed a bit, so when we came in on the first try, that set off alarms. It's my fault, Dog, I knew how crazy paranoidical he is, I
 knew that something was wrong, but not till this minute I didn't know what it was. I should have known it when I got his password, I should have known, I'm sorry, you never should have gotten me into this, I'm sorry, you should have listened to me when I
 told you something was wrong, I should have known, I'm sorry."
\par What I done to Doggy that I never meant to do. What I done to him! Anytime, I could have thought of it, it was all there inside my glassy little head, but no, I didn't think of it till after it
 was way too late. And maybe it's because I didn't want to think of it, maybe it's because I really wanted to be wrong about the green cards, but however it flew, I did what I do, which is to say I'm not the pontiff in his fancy chair, by which I mean I c
an't be smarter than myself.
\par Right away he called the gentlebens of Ossified Crime to warn them, but I was already plugged into the library sucking news as fast as I could and so I knew it wouldn't do no good, cause they got all seven of the big boys and th
eir nitwit taster, too, locked up good and tight for card fraud.
\par And what they said on the phone to Dogwalker made things real clear. "We're dead," says Doggy.
\par "Give them time to cool," says I.
\par "They'll never cool," says he. "There's no chance they'll neve
r forgive this even if they know the whole truth, because look at the names they gave the cards to, it's like they got them for their biggest boys on the borderline, the habibs who bribe presidents of little countries and rake off cash from octopods like 
S
hell and ITT and every now and then kill somebody and walk away clean. Now they're sitting there in jail with the whole life story of the organization in their brains, so they don't care if we meant to do it or not. They're hurting, and the only way they 
know to make the hurt go away is to pass it on to somebody else. And that's us. They want to make us hurt, and hurt real bad, and for a long long time."
\par I never saw Dog so scared. That's the only reason we went to the feds ourselves. We didn't ever want to 
stool, but we needed their protection plan, it was our only hope. So we offered to testify how we did it, not even for immunity, just so they'd change our faces and put us in a safe jail somewhere to work off the sentence and come out alive, you know? Tha
t's all we wanted.
\par But the feds, they laughed at us. They had the inside guy, see, and he was going to get immunity for testifying. "We don't need you," they says to us, "and we don't care if you go to jail or not. It was the big guys we wanted."
\par "If you let us walk," says Doggy, "then they'll think we set them up."
\par "Make us laugh," says the feds. "Us work with street poots like you? They know that we don't stoop so low."
\par "They bought from us," says Doggy. "If we're big enough for them, we're big enough for the dongs."
\par "Do you believe this?" says one fed to his identical junior officer. "These jollies are begging us to take them into jail. Well listen tight, my jolly boys, maybe we don't want to add you to the taxpayers' expense account, did you think of that
? Besides, all we'd give you is time, but on the street, those boys will give you time and a half, and it won't cost us a dime."
\par So what could we do? Doggy just looks like somebody sucked out six pints, he's so white. On the way out of the fedhouse, he says, "Now we're going to find out what it's like to die."
\par And I says to him, "Walker, they stuck no gun in your mouth yet, they shove no shiv in your eye. We still breathing, we got legs, so let's walk out of here."
\par "Walk!" he says. "You walk out of G-boro, glasshead, and you bump into trees."
\par "So what?" says I. "I can plug in and pull out all the data we want about how to live in the woods. Lots of empty land out there. Where do you think the marijuana grows?"
\par "I'm a city boy," he says. "I'm a city boy." Now we're standing out in front, and he's looking around. "In the city I got a chance\emdash I know the city."
\par "Maybe in New York or Dallas," says I, "but G-boro's just too small, not even half a million people, you can't lose yourself deep enough here."
\par "Yeah well," he says, still looking around. "It's none of your business now anyway, Goo Boy. They aren't blaming you, they're blaming me."
\par "But it's my fault," says I, "and I'm staying with you to tell them so."
\par "You think they're going to stop and listen?" says he.
\par "I'll let them shoot me up with speakeasy so they know I'm telling the truth."
\par "It's nobody's fault," says he. "And I don't give a twelve-inch poker whose fault it is anyway. You're clean, but if you stay with me you'll get all muddy, too. I don't need you around, and you sure as hell don't need me. Job's over. Done. Get lost."

\par But I couldn't do that. The same way he couldn't go on walking dogs, I couldn't just run off and leave him to eat my mistake. "They know I was your P-word man," says I. "They'll be after me, too."
\par "Maybe for a while, Goo Boy. But you transfer your twenty percent into Bobby Joe's Face Shop, so they aren't looking for you to get a refund, and then stay quiet for a week and they'll forget all about you."
\par He's right but I don't dare. "I was in for twenty percent of rich," says I. "So I'm in for fifty percent of trouble."
\par All of a sudden he sees what he's looking for. "There they are, Goo Boy, the dorks they sent to hit me. In that Mercedes." I look but all I see are electrics. Then his han
d is on my back and he gives me a shove that takes me right off the portico and into the bushes, and by the time I crawl out, Doggy's nowhere in sight. For about a minute I'm pissed about getting scratched up in the plants, until I realize he was getting 
me out of the way, so I wouldn't get shot down or hacked up or lased out, whatever it is they planned to do to him to get even.
\par I was safe enough, right? I should've walked away, I should've ducked right out of the city. I didn't even have to refund the money. I had enough to go clear out of the country and live the rest of my life where even Occipital Crime couldn't find me.

\par And I thought about it. I stayed the night in Mama Pimple's flophouse because I knew somebody would be watching my own place. All that
 night I thought about places I could go. Australia. New Zealand. Or even a foreign place, I could afford a good vocabulary crystal so picking up a new language would be easy.
\par But in the morning I couldn't do it. Mama Pimple didn't exactly ask me but she looked so worried and all I could say was, "He pushed me into the bushes and I don't know where he is."
\par And she just nods at me and goes back to fixing breakfast. Her hands are shaking she's so upset. Because she knows that Dogwalker doesn't stand a chance against Orphan Crime.
\par "I'm sorry," says I.
\par "What can you do?" she says. "When they want you, they get you. If the feds don't give you a new face, you can't hide."
\par "What if they didn't want him?" says I.
\par She laughs at me. "The story's all over the street. The arrests were in the news, and now everybody knows the big boys are looking for Walker. They want him so bad the whole street can smell it."
\par "What if they knew it wasn't his fault?" says I. "What if they knew it was an accident? A mistake?"
\par Then Mama Pimple squints at me\emdash not many people can tell when she's squinting, but I can\emdash and she says, "Only one boy can tell them that so they'll believe it."
\par "Sure, I know," says I.
\par "And if that boy walks in and says, Let me tell you why you don't want to hurt my friend Dogwalker\emdash "
\par "Nobody said life was safe," I says. "Besides, what could they do to me that's worse than what already happened to me when I was nine?"
\par She comes over and just puts her hand on my head, just lets her hand lie there for a few minutes, and I know what I've got to do.
\par So I did it. Went to Fat Jack's and told him I wanted to talk to Junior Mint about Dogwalker, and it wasn't thirty seconds before I was hustled on out into the alley and driven somewhere with my face mashed into the floor of the ca
r so I couldn't tell where it was. Idiots didn't know that somebody as vertical as me can tell the number of wheel revolutions and the exact trajectory of every curve. I could've drawn a freehand map of where they took me. But if I let them know that, I'd
 never come home, and since there was a good chance I'd end up dosed with speak easy, I went ahead and erased the memory. Good thing I did\emdash that was the first thing they asked me as soon as they had the drug in me.
\par Gave me a grown-up dose, they did, so I pra
ctically told them my whole life story and my opinion of them and everybody and everything else, so the whole session took hours, felt like forever, but at the end they knew, they absolutely knew that Dogwalker was straight with them, and when it was over
 and I was coming up so I had some control over what I said, I asked them, I begged them, Let Dogwalker live. just let him go. He'll give back the money, and I'll give back mine, just let him go.
\par "OK," says the guy.
\par I didn't believe it.
\par "No, you can believe me, we'll let him go."
\par "You got him?"
\par "Picked him up before you even came in. It wasn't hard."
\par "And you didn't kill him?"
\par "Kill him? We had to get the money back first, didn't we, so we needed him alive till morning, and then you came in, and your little story changed our minds, it really did, you made us feel all sloppy and sorry for that poor old pimp."
\par For a few seconds there I actually believed that it was going to be all right. But then I knew from the way they looked, from the way they acted, I knew the same way I know about passwords.
\par They brought in Dogwalker and handed me a book. Dogwalker was very quiet and stiff and he didn't look like he recognized me at all. I didn't even have to look at the book to know what it was. They scooped out his brain 
and replaced it with glass, like me only way over the line, way way over, there was nothing of Dogwalker left inside his head, just glass pipe and goo. The book was a User's Manual, with all the instructions about how to program him and control him.

\par I look
ed at him and he was Dogwalker, the same face, the same hair, everything. Then he moved or talked and he was dead, he was somebody else living in Dogwalker's body. And I says to them, "Why? Why didn't you just kill him, if you were going to do this?"

\par "This
 one was too big," says the guy. "Everybody in G-boro knew what happened, everybody in the whole country, everybody in the world. Even if it was a mistake, we couldn't let it go. No hard feelings, Goo Boy. He is alive. And so are you. And you both stay th
at way, as long as you follow a few simple rules. Since he's over the line, he has to have an owner, and you're it. You can use him however you want\emdash rent out data storage, pimp him as a jig or a jaw\emdash 
but he stays with you always. Every day, he's on the stree
t here in G-boro, so we can bring people here and show them what happens to boys who make mistakes. You can even keep your cut from the job, so you don't have to scramble at all if you don't want to. That's how much we like you, Goo Boy. But if he leaves 
this town or doesn't come out, even one single solitary day, you'll be very sorry for the last six hours of your life. Do you understand?"
\par I understood. I took him with me. I bought this place, these clothes, and that's how it's been ever since. That's why 
we go out on the street every day. I read the whole manual, and I figure there's maybe ten percent of Dogwalker left inside. The part that's Dogwalker can't ever get to the surface, can't even talk or move or anything like that, can't ever remember or eve
n
 consciously think. But maybe he can still wander around inside what used to be his head, maybe he can sample the data stored in all that goo. Maybe someday he'll even run across this story and he'll know what happened to him, and he'll know that I tried 
to save him.
\par In the meantime this is my last will and testament. See, I have us doing all kinds of research on Orgasmic Crime, so that someday I'll know enough to reach inside the system and unplug it. Unplug it all, and make those bastards lose everything 
the way they took everything away from Dogwalker. Trouble is, some places there ain't no way to look without leaving tracks. Goo is as goo do, I always say. I'll find out I'm not as good as I think I am when somebody comes along and puts a hot steel putz 
i
n my face. Knock my brains out when it comes. But there's this, lying in a few hundred places in the system. Three days after I don't lay down my code in a certain program in a certain place, this story pops into view. The fact you're reading this means I
'm dead.
\par Or it means I paid them back, and so I quit suppressing this because I don't care anymore. So maybe this is my swan song, and maybe this is my victory song. You'll never know, will you, mate?
\par But you'll wonder. I like that. You wondering about us, 
whoever you are, you thinking about old Goo Boy and Dogwalker, you guessing whether the fangs who scooped Doggy's skull and turned him into self-propelled property paid for it down to the very last delicious little drop.
\par And in the meantime, I've got this 
goo machine to take care of. Only ten percent a man, he is, but then I'm only forty percent myself. All added up together we make only half a human. But that's the half that counts. That's the half that still wants things. The goo in me and the goo in him
's all just light pipes and electricity. Data without desire. Lightspeed trash. But I have some desires left, just a few, and maybe so does Dogwalker, even fewer. And we'll get what we want. Every speck. Every sparkle. Believe it.
