Acknowledgments<br>
My gratitude to the following people cannot be adequately<br>expressed. I discovered, in the course of writing this book,<br>that physicists, from graduate students to Nobel Laureates,<br>are a gracious group of people; accessible, helpful, and<br>engaging. This discovery shattered my long-held stereo-<br>
type of the cold, &quot;objective&quot; scientific personality. For<br>this, above all, I am grateful to the people listed here.<br>
Jack Sarfatti, Ph.D., Director of the Physics/Consciousness<br>
Research Group, is the catalyst without whom the following<br>
people and I would not have met. Al Chung-liang Huang,<br>The T'ai Chi Master, provided the perfect metaphor of<i> Wu<br>Li,</i> inspiration, and the beautiful calligraphy. David<br>Finkelstein, Ph.D., Director of the School of Physics,<br>Georgia Institute of Technology, was my first tutor. These<br>men are the godfathers of this book.<br>
In addition to Sarfatti and Finkelstein, Brian Josephson,<br>
Professor of Physics, Cambridge University, and Max<br>Jammer, Professor of Physics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-<br>
Gan, Israel, read and commented upon the entire manu-<br>script. I am especially indebted to these men (but I do not<br>wish to imply that any one of them, or any other of the<br>individualistic and creative thinkers who helped me with<br>this book, would approve of it, page for page, as it is<br>written, nor that the responsibility for any errors or mis-<br>interpretations belongs to anyone but me).<br>
I am also indebted to Henry Stapp, Ph.D., Lawrence<br>
Berkeley Laboratory, for reading and commenting upon<br>

portions of the manuscript, and to Elizabeth Rauscher,<br>Ph.D., founder and sponsor of the Fundamental Physics<br>
Group, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, for encouraging<br>non-physicists to partake of weekly conferences which<br>normally would attract only physicists. In addition to Stapp<br>and Sarfatti, this group included John Clauser, Ph.D.;<br>Philippe Eberhard, Ph.D.; George Weissman, Ph.D.; Fred<br>Wolf, Ph.D,; and Fritjof Capra, Ph.D,; among others.<br>
I am grateful to Carson Jefferies, Professor of Physics,<br>
University of California at Berkeley, for his support and<br>for commenting upon portions of the manuscript; to David<br>Bohm, Professor of Physics, Birkbeck College, University<br>
of London, for reading portions of the manuscript; to<br>Saul-Paul Sirag for his frequent assistance; to the physi-<br>cists of the Particle Data Group, Lawrence Berkeley Labo-<br>ratory, for their assistance in compiling the particle table at<br>the back of the book; to Eleanor Criswell, Professor of<br>Psychology, Sonoma State University (California), for her<br>
valuable support; to Gin McCollum, Professor of Mathe-<br>matics, Kansas State University, for her assistance and for<br>her patient tutelage; and to Nick Herbert, Ph.D., Director<br>of the C-Life Institute, for providing me with his excellent<br>papers on Bell's theorem and for permission to use his<br>paper title, &quot;More than Both,&quot; as a chapter title.<br>
All of the illustrations in this book were done by Thomas<br>
Linden Robinson.<br>
Harvey White, Professor Emeritus, Department of Phys-<br>
ics, University of California at Berkeley, and former Di-<br>rector, Lawrence Hall of Science, personally provided<br>
photographs of his famous simulations of probability dis-<br>tribution patterns. The electron diffraction photograph was<br>
provided by Ronald Gronsky, Ph.D., Lawrence Berkeley<br>Laboratory. I learned much about spectroscopy from Sumner<br>Davis, Professor of Physics, University of California at<br>Berkeley. I am deeply grateful to these men who, like all<br>of the physicists that I encountered in writing this book,<br>

gave graciously of their time and knowledge to a stranger<br>who needed help.<br>
I also am indebted to Maria Guarnaschelli, my editor,<br>
for her sensitivity and erudition.<br>
Without the generosity of Michael Murphy and the Board<br>
of Directors of the Esalen Institute, which sponsored the<br>
1976 conference on physics and consciousness, none of<br>
this probably would have happened.<br>

Foreword<br>
When Gary Zukav announced his plans for this book, creating<br>the outline with Al Huang and me watching at a dinner table<br>at Esalen, 1976, I did not realize the magnitude of the job he<br>took on with such joy. Watching the book grow has been<br>instructive and rewarding, because Zukav has insisted on going<br>through the whole evolution of the quantum relativistic phys-<br>ics of today, treating it as it is, an unfolding story. As a result<br>this book is not only readable, but it also puts the reader in<br>touch with all the various ways that physicists have worked<br>
out for talking about what is so hard to talk about. In short,<br>Gary Zukav has written a very good book for laymen.<br>
Zukav's attitude to physics is rather close to mine, so I<br>
must be a layman too, and it is more stimulating to talk phys-<br>ics with him than with most professionals. He knows that<br>
physics is—among other things—an attempt to harmonize with<br>a much greater entity than ourselves, requiring us to seek,<br>formulate and eradicate first one and then another of our most<br>cherished prejudices and oldest habits of thought, in a never-<br>ending quest for the unattainable.<br>
Zukav has graciously offered me this place to add my own<br>
emphases to his narrative. Since it has been three years since<br>we met, I must sift my memory for a while.<br>
Migrating whales come to mind first. I remember us standing<br>
on the Esalen cliffs and watching them cavort as they headed<br>south. Next comes to mind beautiful Monarch butterflies,<br>dotting the fields from the first day, and covering one magic<br>tree as thick as leaves in a grand finale. Between the whales<br>and the butterflies it was difficult for us to feel self-important<br>and very easy for us to play.<br>
The very difficulty of communicating with the physicists at<br>
Esalen helped me to realize how differently most physicists<br>
think about quantum mechanics than I do. Not that my way is<br>

new, it is one of two ways already pointed out in John Von<br>Neumann's 1932 book,<i> The Mathematical Foundation of Quan-<br>tum mechanics</i><br>
1 Quantum mechanics deals with propositions defined by<br>
processes of preparation and observation involving subject and<br>object and obeying a new logic, not with objective properties<br>of the object alone<br>
2 Quantum mechanics deals with objective properties of<br>
the object alone, obeying the old logic, but they jump in a<br>random way when an observation is made<br>
Most working physicists seem to see one of these ways (the<br>
second) and not the other Perhaps personality can determine<br>the direction of science I think there are ' thing minds and<br>&quot;people ' minds Good parents, psychologists and writers have<br>to be 'people ' people, while mechanics, engineers and physi-<br>cists tend to be thing&quot; people Physics has become too scary<br>
for such physicists because it is already so thingless New<br>evolutions, as profound as those of Einstein and Heisenberg,<br>are waiting for a new generation of more daring and inte-<br>grated thinkers<br>
While most physicists take for granted the quantum tools of<br>
their dailv work, there is a vanguard already testing roads to<br>the next physics, and a rearguard still conscientiously holding<br>the road back to the old Bell's theorem is mainly important<br>to the latter, and its prominence in the book does not mean it<br>uncovers problems in present-day quantum physics Rather<br>Bell's theorem drives toward a view that most physicists al-<br>ready assume that quantum mechanics is something new and<br>
different<br>
Here it helps to distinguish between a<i> complete</i> theory,<br>
predicting everything, what Newtonians look for (it does not<br>seem that Newton was a strict Newtonian, since he wanted<br>God to reset the world clock now and then) and a<i> maximal<br></i>theory, predicting as much as possible, what quantum physi-<br>cists look for In spite of their controversy, Einstein and Bohr<br>
both agreed, in their different ways that quantum mechanics<br>
is incomplete, and even that it is not vet maximal What they<br>really debated was whether or not an incomplete theory can<br>be maximal Throughout their famous controversy Einstein<br>argued, Alas, our theory is too poor for experience, ' and<br>Bohr replied, &quot;No, no' Experience is too rich for our theory'<br>
just as some existential philosophers despair at the indeterminacy of life and the existence of choices, and others feel<i> elan<br>vital</i><br>
One of the features of quantum mechanics that leads to such<br>
controversy is its concern with the nonexistent, the potential<br>There is some of this in all language, or words could only be<br>used once, but quantum mechanics is more involved with<br>probabilities than classical mechanics Some people feel this<br>
discredits quantum theory, makes it less than maximal theory<br>
So it is important to mention in defense of quantum theory<br>that in spite of indeterminacy, quantum mechanics can be<br>entirely expressed in yes-or-no terms about individual experi-<br>ments, just like classical mechanics, and that probabilities can<br>be derived as a law of large numbeis and need not be<br>
postulated I prefer to state the difference between classical<br>and quantum theories not as presented in textbooks, but thus<br>Once sufficient data is given, classical mechanics gives &gt;es-or-no<br>answers for all further questions while quantum mechanics<br>simply leaves<i> unanswered</i> some questions in the theory, to be<br>answered by experience I wish here also to note the regrettable<br>tendency, in myself also, to feel that quantum mechanics must<br>thereby deny physcial existence to those answers that are<br>foi .id in experience only, not in the theory, such as the mo-<br>mentum of a localized electron So involved are we in our<br>symbol systems<br>
After a week of talking, the conference was still working on<br>
the elements of quantum logic, and never did get far into the<br>new quantum time concepts we wanted to try out, but it<br>made it easier to move on to the next set of problems, which<br>occupy me today Quantum mechanics is characterized by its<br>unanswered questions Some logicians, Martin Davis for one,<br>have suggested these may be related to the undecidable<br>propositions dominating logic since Godel I used to know<br>better Nowadays I think they may be right, the common<br>element being reflexivity and the impossibility for finite systems<br>of total self-knowledge The proper study of mankind is endless,<br>it seems I hope these ideas work out and Gary Zukav writes a<br>book about them He does it well<br>

Introduction<br>
My first exposure to quantum physics occurred a few years<br>
ago when a friend invited me to an afternoon conference at<br>the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, California. At<br>that time, I had no connections with the scientific communi-<br>ty, so I went to see what physicists were like. To my great<br>surprise, I discovered that (1), I understood everything that<br>they said, and (2), their discussion sounded very much like a<br>theological discussion. I scarcely could believe what I had<br>
discovered. Physics was not the sterile, boring discipline that<br>I had assumed it to be. It was a rich, profound venture which<br>had become inseparable from philosophy. Incredibly, no one<br>but physicists seemed to be aware of this remarkable devel-<br>opment. As my interest in and knowledge of physics grew,<br>I resolved to share this discovery with others. This book is a<br>gift of my discovery. It is one of a series.<br>
Generally speaking, people can be grouped into two cate-<br>
gories of intellectual preference. The first group prefers<br>explorations which require a precision of logical processes.<br>
These are the people who become interested in the natural<br>sciences and mathematics. They do not become scientists be-<br>cause of their education, they choose a scientific education<br>because it gratifies their scientific mental set. The second<br>group prefers explorations which involve the intellect in a less<br>logically rigorous manner. These are the people who become<br>
interested in the liberal arts. They do not have a liberal arts<br>mentality because of their education, they choose a liberal arts<br>
education because it gratifies their liberal arts mental set.<br>
Since both groups are intelligent, it is not difficult for<br>
members of one group to understand what members of the<br>other group are studying. However, I have discovered a no-<br>table<i> communication</i> problem between the two groups. Many<br>times my physicist friends have attempted to explain a con-<br>

cept to me and, in their exasperation, have tried one explanation<br>after another, each one of which sounded (to me) abstract,<br>difficult to grasp, and generally abstruse When I could com-<br>prehend, at last, what they were trying to communicate, inev-<br>
itably I was surprised to discover that the idea itself was actu-<br>ally quite simple Conversely, I often have tried to explain a<br>concept in terms which seemed (to me) laudably lucid, but<br>which, to my exasperation, seemed hopelessly vague, ambigu-<br>ous, and lacking in precision to my physicist friends I hope<br>that this book will be a useful<i> translation</i> which will help those<br>
people who do not have a scientific mental set (like me) to un-<br>derstand the extraordinary process which is occurring in theo-<br>retical physics Like any translation, it is not as good as the<br>ongmal work and, of course, it is subject to the shortcomings<br>of the translator For better or worse, my first qualification as<br>a translator is that, like you, I am not a physicist<br>
To compensate for my lack of education in physics (and for<br>
my liberal arts mentality) I asked, and received, the assistance<br>of an extraordinary group of physicists (They are listed in the<br>acknowledgments) Four of them in particular, read the entire<br>manuscript As each chapter was completed, I sent a copy of<br>it to each physicist and asked him to correct any conceptual or<br>
factual errors which he found (Several other physicists read<br>selected chapters)<br>
My original intention was to use these comments to correct<br>

 ered that my physicist friends<br>
had given more attention to the manuscript than I had dared<br>to hope Not only were their comments thoughtful and pene-<br>trating, but, taken together, they formed a significant volume<br>of information by themselves The more I studied them, the<br>more strongly I felt that I should share these comments with<br>you Therefore, in addtion to correcting the manuscript with<br>them, I also included in the footnotes those comments which<br>do not dupicate the corrected text In particular, I footnoted<br>those comments which would have slowed the flow of the text<br>
or made it technical, and those comments which disagreed<br>with the text and also disagreed with the comments of the<br>other physicists By publishing dissenting opinions in the foot-<br>notes, I have been able to include numerous ideas which<br>would have lengthened and complicated the book if they had<br>been presented in the text From the beginning of<i> The Danc-<br>ing Wu Li Masters</i> to the end, no term is used which is not<br>
explained immediately before or after its<b> first</b> use This rule is<br>

not followed in the footnotes This gives, the footnotes an<br>unmitigated freedom of expression However, it also means<br>that the footnotes contain terms that are not explained hefore,<br>during, or after their use The text respects your status as<br>newcomer to a vast and exciting realm The footnotes do not<br>
However, if you read the footnotes as vou read the book,<br>
you will have the rare opportunity to see what four of the<br>finest physicists in the world have to say about it as they in<br>
effect, read it along with you Their footnotes punctuate, illus-<br>trate, annotate, and jab at everything in the text Better than<br>it can be described, these footnotes reveal the aggressive<br>precision with which men of science seek to remove the<br>
flaws from the work of a fellow scientist, even if he is an<br>untrained colleague, like me, and the work is nontechnical,<br>like this book<br>
The ' new physics, ' as it is used in this book, means quantum<br>
mechanics which began with Max Planck s theory of quanta<br>in 1900, and relativity, which began with Albert Einstein's<br>special theory of relativity in 1905 The old physics is the<br>
physics of Isaac Newton, which he discovered about three<br>hundred years ago 'Classical physics means any physics that<br>attempts to explain reality in such a manner that for every<br>element of physical reality there is a corresponding element<br>in the theory Therefore, 'classical physics includes the phys-<br>ics of Isaac Newton and relativity, both of which are structured<br>in this one-to-one manner It does not, however, include<br>quantum mechanics, which, as we shall see, is one of the<br>things that makes quantum mechanics unique<br>
Be gentle with yourself as you read This book contains<br>
many rich and multifaceted stories, all of which are heady<br>(pun?) stuff You cannot learn them all at once any more than<br>you can learn the stories told in<i> War and Peace Crime and</i><br>
<i>Punishment,</i> and<i> Les Miserables</i> all at once I suggest that you<br>read this book for your pleasure, and not to learn what is in it<br>There is a complete index at the back of the book and a good<br>table of contents in the front Between the two of them, you<br>can return to any subject that catches your interest More-<br>over by enjoying yourself, you probably will remember more<br>than if you had set about to learn it all<br>
One last note, this is not a book about physics and eastern<br>
philosophies Although the poetic framework of<i> Wu Li</i> is con-<br>ducive to such comparisons this book is about quantum phys-<br>ics and relativity In the future I hope to write another book<br>

CHAPTER<br>
1<br>
Big Week at Big Sur<br>
When I tell my friends that I study physics, they move their<br>heads from side to side, they shake their hands at the wrist,<br>and they whistle, &quot;Whew! That's difficult.&quot; This universal<br>reaction to the word &quot;physics&quot; is a wall that stands between<br>what physicists do and what most people think they do. There<br>is usually a big difference between the two.<br>
Physicists themselves are partly to blame for this sad situation.<br>
Their shop talk sounds like advanced Greek, unless you are<br>Greek or a physicist. When they are not talking to other<br>physicists, physicists speak English. Ask them what they do,<br>however, and they sound like the natives of Corfu again.<br>
On the other hand, part of the blame is ours. Generally<br>
speaking, we have given up trying to understand what physi-<br>
cists (and biologists, etc.) really do. In this we do ourselves a<br>disservice. These people are engaged in extremely interesting<br>adventures that are not that difficult to understand. True,<br><i>how</i> they do what they do sometimes entails a technical<br>explanation which, if you are not an expert, can produce an<br>involuntary deep sleep.<i> What</i> physicists do, however, is actu-<br>ally quite simple. They wonder what the universe is really<br>made of, how it works, what we are doing in it, and where it<br>is going, if it is going anyplace at all. In short, they do the<br>same things that we do on starry nights when we look up at<br>the vastness of the universe and feel overwhelmed by it and a<br>part of it at the same time. That is what physicists really do,<br>and the clever rascals get paid for doing it.<br>
Unfortunately, when most people think of &quot;physics,&quot; they<br>
think of chalkboards covered with undecipherable symbols of<br>

an unknown mathematics. The fact is that physics is not math-<br>ematics. Physics, in essence, is simple wonder at the way<br>things are and a divine (some call it compulsive) interest in<br>how that is so. Mathematics is the<i> tool</i> of physics. Stripped of<br>mathematics, physics becomes pure enchantment.<br>
I had spoken often to Jack Sarfatti, who is the physicist<br>
director of the Physics/Consciousness Research Group, about<br>the possibility of writing a book, unencumbered with techni-<br>calities and mathematics, to explain the exciting insights that<br>motivate current physics. So when he invited me to a confer-<br>ence on physics that he and Michael Murphy were arranging<br>at the Esalen Institute, I accepted with a purpose.<br>
The Esalen Institute (it is named for an Indian tribe) is in<br>
Northern California. The northern California coast is an awe-<br>some combination of power and beauty, but nowhere so much<br>
as along the Pacific Coast Highway between the towns of Big<br>Sur and San Luis Obispo. The Esalen facilities are located<br>about a half hour south of Big Sur between the highway and<br>the coastal mountains on the one side and rugged cliffs<br>overlooking the Pacific Ocean on the other. A dancing stream<br>divides the northern third of the grounds from the remainder.<br>On that side is a big house (called the Big House) where<br>guests stay and groups meet, along with a small home where<br>Dick Price (co-founder of Esalen with Murphy) stays with his<br>family. On the other side of the stream is a lodge where meals<br>
are served and meetings are held, accommodations for guests<br>and staff, and hot sulfur baths.<br>
Dinner at Esalen is a multi-dimensional experience. The<br>
elements are candlelight, organic food, and a contagious<br>naturalness that is the essence of the Esalen experience. Sarfatti<br>and I joined two men who already were eating. One was<br>David Finkelstein, a physicist from Yeshiva University (in<br>New York) who was attending the conference on physics. The<br>other was Al Chung-liang Huang, a T'ai Chi Master who was<br>leading a workshop at Esalen. We could not have chosen<br>
better companions.<br>
The conversation soon turned to physics.<br>&quot;When I studied physics in Taiwan,&quot; said Huang, &quot;we<br>
called it Wu Li (pronounced 'Woo Lee'). It means 'Patterns of<br>
Organic Energy.' &quot;<br>
Everyone at the table was taken at once by this image.<br>
Mental lights flashed on, one by one, as the idea penetrated.<br>

&quot;Wu Li&quot; was more than poetic. It was the best definition of<br>
physics that the conference would produce. It caught that<br>certain something, that living quality that we were seeking to<br>express in a book, that thing without which physics becomes<br>sterile.<br>
&quot;Let's write a book about Wu Li!&quot; I heard myself exclaim.<br>
Immediately, ideas and energy began to flow, and in one<br>stroke all of the prior planning that I had done went out the<br>
window. From that pooling of energy came the image of the<br>
Dancing Wu Li Masters. My remaining days at Esalen and<br>those that followed were devoted to finding out what Wu Li<br>Masters are, and why they dance. All of us sensed with<br>
excitement and certitude that we had discovered the channel<br>through which the very things that we wanted to say about<br>physics would flow.<br>
The Chinese language does not use an alphabet like western<br>
languages. Each word in Chinese is depicted by a character,<br>which is a line drawing. (Sometimes two or more characters<br>are combined to form different meanings). This is why it is<br>difficult to translate Chinese into English. Good translations<br>require a translator who is both a poet and a linguist.<br>
For example, &quot;Wu&quot; can mean either &quot;matter&quot; or &quot;energy.&quot;<br>
&quot;Li&quot; is a richly poetic word. It means &quot;universal order&quot; or<br>&quot;universal law.&quot; It also means &quot;organic patterns.&quot; The grain in<br>a panel of wood is Li. The organic pattern on the surface of a<br>leaf is also Li, and so is the texture of a rose petal. In<br>short, Wu Li, the Chinese word for physics, means &quot;pat-<br>terns of organic energy&quot; (&quot;matter/energy&quot; [Wu] + &quot;universal<br>order/organic patterns&quot; [Li]). This is remarkable since it reflects<br>
a world view which the founders of western science (Galileo<br>and Newton) simply did not comprehend, but toward which<br>virtually every physical theory of import in the twentieth<br>century is pointing! The question is not, &quot;Do they know some-<br>thing that we don't?&quot; The question is, &quot;How do they know it?&quot;<br>
English words can be pronounced almost any way without<br>
changing their meanings. I was five years a college graduate<br>before I learned to pronounce &quot;consummate&quot; as an adjective<br>(con-SUM-mate). (It means &quot;carried to the utmost extent or<br>degree; perfect&quot;). I live in anguish when I think of the times<br>that I have spoken of consummate linguists, consummate<br>scholars, etc. Someone always seemed to be holding back a<br>

smile, almost I learned later that these were the people who<br>
read dictionaries Nonetheless, my bad pronunciation never<br>prevented me from being understood That is because inflec-<br>
tions do not change the denotation of an English word 'No&quot;<br>spoken with a rising inflection<br>
 with a downward in-<br>
flection (&quot;No'&quot;), and with no inflection (&quot;No &quot;) all mean<br>(according to the<br>
 ' a denial, a refusal, negative &quot;<br>
This is not so in Chinese Vlost Chinese<br>
 can be<br>
pronounced several different ways Each different pronunci-<br>ation is a different word which is written differently and which<br>has a meaning of its own Therefore, the same syllable,<br>pronounced with different inflections, which unaccustomed<br>western listeners scarcely can distinguish, constitutes distinctly<br>separate words, each with its own ideogiam and meaning, to a<br>Chinese listener In English, which is an atonal language,<br>these different ideograms are all written and pronounced the<br>same way<br>
For example, there are over eighty different &quot;Wu&quot;s in Chi-<br>
nese, J! of which are spelled and pronounced the same way<br>in English Al Huang has taken five of these ' Wu&quot;s, each of<br>which, when combined with &quot;Li, ' produces a different &quot;Wu<br>Li,&quot; each with the same English spelling, and each pronounced<br>(in English) &quot;Woo Lee &quot;<br>
The first Wu Li means &quot;Patterns of Organic Energy This<br>
is the Chinese wav of saying &quot;ph&gt;sics ' (Wu means 'matter&quot;<br>or &quot;energy')<br>
The second Wu Li means &quot;My Way (Wu ineans &quot;mine<br>
or &quot;self)<br>
The third Wu Li means 'Nonsense &quot; (Wu means &quot;void&quot; or<br>
&quot;nonbemg&quot;)<br>
The fourth Wu Li means &quot;I Clutch My Ideas &quot; (Wu means<br>
&quot;to make a fist&quot; or &quot;clutch with a closed hand )<br>
The fifth Wu Li means &quot;Enlightenment ' (Wu ineans<br>
&quot;enlightenment&quot; or &quot;my heart/mv mind )<br>
If we were to stand behind a master weaver as he begins to<br>
work his loom, we would see, at first, not cloth, but a multi-<br>tude of brightly colored threads from which he picks and<br>chooses with his expert eye, and feeds into the moving shuttle<br>As we continue to watch, the threads blend one into the<br>other, a fabric appears, and on the fabric, behold' A pattern<br>emerges<br>
In a similar manner, Al Huang has created a beautiful tapestry<br>
from his own epistemological loom<br>

Wu Li = Enlightenment<br>
Each of the physicists at the conference, to a person, reported<br>
 resonance with this rich metaphor Here, at last, was the<br>
I vehicle through which we could present the seminal elements<br>
lof advanced physics By the end of the week, everyone at<br>
|Esalen was talking about Wu Li<br>
At the same time<br>
 this was happening, I was tr&gt;mg to<br>
 out what a &quot;Master&quot; is The dictionary was no help All of<br>
<b>tits</b> definitions involved an element of control This did not fit<br>|easily into our image of the Dancing Wu Li Masters Since Al<br>
 is a T'ai Chi Master, I asked him<br>
&quot;That is the word that other people use to describe me,&quot; he<br>
aid To Al Huang, Al Huang was just Al Huang<br>
Later in the week, I asked him the same question again,<br>
hoping to get a more tangible answer<br>
&quot;A Master is someone who started before you did,&quot; was<br>
|what I got that time<br>
Mv western education left me unable to accept a nondefim-<br>
 for my definition of a &quot;Master,&quot; so I began to read<br>
<i> Embrace</i><br>
<i> Return to Mountain</i> There, in the<br>
breword by Alan Watts, in a paragraph describing Al Huang,<br>
: found what I sought Said Alan Watts of Al Huang<br>
He begins from the center and not from the fringe He<br>imparts an understanding of the basic principles of the<br>
art before going on to the meticulous details, and he<br>refuses to break down the t ai chi movements into a<br>one-two-three drill so as to make the student into a robot<br>
The traditional way is to teach by rote, and to give<br>
the impression that long periods of boredom are the most<br>essential part of training In that way a student may go on<br>for yeai s and years without ever getting the feel of what<br>he is doing<br>
Here was just the definition of a Master that I sought A<br>
 teaches essence When the essence is perceived, he<br>
caches what is necessary to expand the perception The Wu<br>

Li Master does not speak of gravity until the student stands in<br>
wonder at the flower petal falling to the ground He does not<br>speak of laws until the student, of his own, savs. How strange'<br>I drop two stones simultaneously, one heavy and one light,<br>and<i> both</i> of them reach the earth at the same moment'&quot; He<br>does not speak of mathematics until the student savs, &quot;There<br>must be a way to express this more simply '<br>
In this way, the Wu Li Master dances with his student The<br>
Wu Li Master does not teach, but the student learns The Wu<br>Li Master always begins at the center, at the heart of the<br>matter This is the approach that we take in this book It is<br>written for intelligent people who want to know about ad-<br>
vanced physics but who are ignorant of its terminology and,<br>perhaps, of its mathematics<i> The</i><br>
<i> Wu Li</i><br>
 is a<br>
book of essence the essence of quantum mechanics quantum<br>
logic, special relativity, general relativity, and some new ideas<br>that indicate the direction that physics seems to be moving<br>Of course, who can know where the future<br>
 The only<br>
surety is that what we think todav will be a part of the past<br>tomorrow Therefore, this book deals not with knowledge,<br>which is always past tense anyway, but with imagination, which<br>is physics come alive, which is Wu Li<br>
One of the greatest physicists of all, Albert Einstein, was<br>
perhaps a Wu Li Master In 1938 he wiote<br>
Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind,<br>
and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined<br>by the external world In our endeavor to understand<br>reality we are somewhat like a man trying to understand<br>the mechanism of a closed watch He sees the face and<br>the moving hands, even hears its ticking, but he has no<br>way of opening the case If he is ingenious he may form<br>some picture of a mechanism which could be responsible<br>for all the things he observes, but he may never be quite<br>sure his picture is the only one which could explain his<br>observations He will never be able to compare his pic-<br>ture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imag-<br>ine the possibility of the meaning of such a comparison 2<br>
Most people believe that physicists are explaining the world<br>Some physicists even believe that, but the Wu Li Masters<br>
know that they are only dancing with it<br>
I asked Huang how he structures his classes<br>

we dance, we do it for the first time &quot;<br>
&quot;But surely you cannot be starting new each lesson,&quot; I said<br>
'Lesson number two must be built on what you taught in<br>
lesson number one, and lesson three likewise must be built<br>
on lessons one and two, and so on<br>
&quot;When I say that every lesson is the first lesson,&quot; he replied,<br>

means that<br>

This is another characteristic of a Master Whatever he<br>
does, he does with the enthusiasm of doing it for the first<br>time This is the source of his unlimited energy Every lesson<br>that he teaches (or learns) is a first lesson Every dance that<br>he dances, he dances for the first time It is always new,<br>personal, and alive<br>
Isidor I Rabi, Nobel Prue winner in Physics and the for-<br>
mer Chairman of the Physics Department at Columbia Uni-<br>versity, wrote<br>
We don't teach our students enough of the intellectual<br>content of experiments—their novelty and their capacity<br>for opening new fields My own view is that you take<br>these things<br>
 You do an experiment because<br>
your own<br>
 makes vou want to know the result<br>
It's too hard and life is too short, to spend your time<br>doing something because somone else has said it s impor-<br>tant You must feel the thing yourself 3<br>
 most physicists are not like Rabi The major-<br>
ity of them, in fact,<i> do</i> spend their lives doing what other<br>
eople have told them is important That was the point Rabi<br>
vas making<br>
This brings us to a common misunderstanding When most<br>
eople say &quot;scientist, ' they mean 'technician A technician<br>
Is a highly trained person whose job is to apply known<br>
 and principles He deals with the known A scientist<br>
|s a person who seeks to know the true nature of physical<br>
eality He deals with the unknown<br>
In short, scientists discover and technicians apply Howev-<br>
er, it is no longer evident whether scientists really discover<br>hew things or whether they<i> create</i> them Manv people be-<br>
lieve that 'discovery&quot; is actually an act of creation If this is<br>

and writers is not clear In fact, it is possible that scientists,<br>poets, painters and writers are all members of the same family<br>of people whose gift it is by nature to take those things which<br>we call commonplace and to<i> re-present</i> them to us in such<br>ways that our self-imposed limitations are expanded Those<br>
people in whom this gift is especially pronounced, we call<br>
geniuses<br>
The fact is that most &quot;scientists&quot; are technicians They are<br>
not interested in the essentially new Their field of vision is<br>relatively narrow, their energies are directed toward applying<br>what is already known Because their noses often are buried<br>in the bark of a particular tree it is difficult to speak<br>meaningfully to them of forests The case of the mysterious<br>hydrogen spectrum illustrates the difference between scientists<br>and technicians<br>
When a white light, such as sunlight, enters a glass prism,<br>
one of the most beautiful of phenomena occurs Out the other<br>side of the pnsm comes not white light, but every color in the<br>rainbow from dark red to light violet, with orange, yellow,<br>green and blue in between This is because white light is<br>made of all these different colors It is a combination, whereas<br>red light contains only red light, green light contains only<br>
green light, etc Isaac Newton wrote his famous<i> Optiks</i> about<br>this phenomenon three hundred years ago This display of<br>colors is called a white-light spectrum The spectral analysis of<br>white light shows a complete spectrum because white light<br>contains all of the colors that our eyes can see (and some that<br>they cannot sec, like infrared and ultraviolet)<br>
However, not every spectral analysis produces a complete<br>
spectrum If we take one of the chemical elements, for example,<br>like sodium, cause it to emit light, and shine that light through<br>a glass prism, we get only<i> part</i> of a complete spectrum<br>
If an object is visible in a dark room, it is emitting light If<br>
it appears red, for example, it is emitting red light Light is<br>emitted bv ' excited objects Exciting a piece of sodium does<br>not mean offering it tickets to the Super Bowl Exciting a<br>
piece of sodium means adding some energy to it One way of<br>doing this is to heat it When we shine the light emitted by<br>
excited (incandescent) sodium through a pnsm, or spectroscope,<br>
we do not obtain the full array of colors charactenstic of white<br>light,<i> but only</i><br>
<i> of it</i> In the case of sodium, we obtain<br>
two thin yellow lines<br>

We also can produce a negative image of the sodium<br>
spectrum by shining white light through sodium vapor to see<br>what parts of the white light the sodium vapor absorbs White<br>light passing through sodium vapor and then through a<br>spectroscope produces the whole rainbow of colors<i> minus</i> the<br>two &gt; ellow lines emitted bv incandescent sodium<br>
Either way, the sodium spectrum always produces the same<br>
distinct pattern It may be composed of black lines on an<br>otherwise complete spectrum of colors or it may be com-<br>posed of colored lines without the rest of the spectrum, but it<br>alwavs remains the same * This pattern is the fingerprint of the<br>element sodium Each element emits (or absorbs) onl&gt; specific<br>colors Likewise, each element produces a specific spectroscopic<br>pattern which never varies<br>
Hydrogen is the simplest element It seems to have only<br>
two components, a proton, which has a positive charge, and<br>
an electron, which has a negative charge We must say it<br>seems to have&quot; because there is not one person alive who has<br>ever seen a hydrogen atom If hvdrogen atoms exist, millions<br>of them can exist on a pinhead, so small are they calculated to<br>be Hydrogen atoms&quot; is a speculation about what is inside of<br>the watch We can say only that the existence of such entities<br>nicely explains certain observations that would be very diffi-<br>cult to explain otherwise, barring explanations such as the<br>devil did it,&quot; which still may prove to be correct (It is this<br>kind of explanation that drove Galileo, Newton, and Descartes<br>to create what is now modern science)<br>
At one time physicists thought that atoms were constructed<br>
in the following way At the center of an atom is a nucleus,<br>
just as the sun is at the center of our solar system In the<br>
nucleus is located almost all of the mass of the atom in the<br>form of positively charged particles (protons) and particles<br>about the same size as protons but without a charge (neu-<br>trons) (Only hydrogen has no neutrons in its nucleus) Orbiting<br>about the nucleus, as the planets orbit the sun, are electrons,<br>which have almost no mass compared with the nucleus Each<br>electron has one negative charge The number of electrons is<br>always the same as the number of protons, so that the positive<br>and negative charges cancel each other and the atom, as a<br>
whole, has no charge<br>

our solar system is that the distances between an atomic nucleus<br>and its electrons are enormously greater than we picture the<br>
distances between the sun and its planets The space occu-<br>pied by an atom is so huge, compared with the mass of its<br>particles (almost all of which is in the nucleus), that the electrons<br>orbiting the nucleus are &quot;like a few flies in a cathedral&quot; ac-<br>cording to Ernest Rutherford, who created this model of the<br>atom in 1911<br>
This is the familiar picture of the atom that most of us<br>
learned in school, usually under duress Unfortunately, this<br>picture is obsolete, so you can forget the whole thing We will<br>discuss later how physicists currently think of an atom The<br>point here is that the planetary model of the atom formed the<br>background against which a most puzzling problem was solved<br>
The spectrum of hydrogen, the simplest of the atoms,<br>
contains over one hundred lines' The patterns of the other<br>elements are even more complicated When we shine the<br>light from excited hydrogen gas through a spectroscope, we<br>get over one hundred different lines of color in a distinct<br>pattern * The question is, &quot;How can such a simple thing like<br>a hydrogen atom, which has only two components, a proton<br>and an electron, account for such a complex<br>
One way of thinking about light is to ascribe wave-like<br>
properties to it, and then to say that different colors have<br>different frequencies, just as different sounds, which also are<br>waves, have different frequencies Arnold Sommerfield, a<br>German physicist who also was an accomplished pianist, ob-<br>served, tongue-in-cheek, that hydrogen atoms, which emit<br>
over one hundred different frequencies, must be more com-<br>plicated than grand pianos, which emit only eighty-eight dif-<br>ferent frequencies'<br>
It was a Danish physicist named Niels Bohr who came up<br>
with an explanation (in 1913) that made so much sense that it<br>won him a Nobel Prize Like most ideas in physics, it is<br>essentially simple Bohr did not start with what was theoretically<br>
* Accurately speaking<br>
 experimental equipment is required to photo<br>
graph each series of the hydrogen spectrum Therefore most single photo<br>graphs of the hydrogen spectrum show only about 10 lines Theoretically there<br>are an infinite number of lines in each atomic spectrum In feet theoretically<br>there are an infinite number of lines m each series of each spectrum because<br>the lines in tht. higher frequency range of each senes become so closely spaced<br>that m effect they form<i> »</i> continuum<br>

&quot;known&quot; about the structure of atoms He started with what<br>he really<i> knew</i> about atoms, that is, he started with raw<br>spectroscopic data Bohr speculated that electrons revolve<br>
around the nucleus of an atom not at just any distance, but in<br>orbits or shells, which are specific distances from the nucleus<br>
Each of these shells<br>
 there are an infinite num-<br>
ber of them), contains up to a certain number of electrons, but<br>no more<br>
If the atom has more electrons than the first shell can ac-<br>
commodate, the electrons begin to fill up the second shell If<br>the atom has more electrons than the first and second shells<br>combined can hold, the third shell begins to fill and so on,<br>like this<br>

His calculations were based on the hydrogen atom, which<br>
has only one electron According to Bohr s theory, the electron<br>in<br>
 hydrogen atom stays as close to the nucleus as it can<br>
get In other words, it usually is in the first shell This is the<br>lowest energy state of a hydrogen atom (Physicists call the<br>lowest energy state of any atom its ground state ) If we<br>excite an atom of hydrogen we cause its electron to jump to<br>one of the outer shells How far it jumps depends upon how<br>much energy we give it If we really heat the atom up (thermal<br>energy), we cause its electron to make a verv large jump all<br>the wav to one of the outer shells Smaller amounts of<br>make the electron jump less far However, as soon as it can<br>(when we stop heating it), the electron returns to a shell<br>
closer in Eventually it returns all the way back to shell num-<br>ber one Whenever the electron jumps from an outer shell to<br>an inner shell, it emits energv in the form of light The energv<br>that the electron emits is exactly the amount of energy that it<br>absorbed when it jumped outward in the first place Bohr<br>discovered that all of the possible combinations of jumps that<br>the hydrogen electron can make on its journeys back to the<br>ground state (the first shell) equals the number of lines in the<br>
hydrogen spectrum'<br>
This is Bohr's famous solution to the grand-piano mvstery<br>
If the electron in a hydrogen atom travels from an outer shell<br>
all the way to the innermost shell in one jump, it gi\ es off a<br>certain amount of energy That makes one line in the hydro-<br>

gen spectrum If the electron in a hydrogen atom makes a<br>tiny jump from an outer shell to the next shell inward, it gives<br>off a much smaller amount of energy That makes another<br>spectral line If the electron in a hydrogen atom jumps from<br>shell five to shell three, for example, that makes yet another<br>line A jump from shell six to shell four and then from shell<br>four to shell one makes two more spectral lines, and so on In<br>this way we can account for the entire hydrogen spectrum<br>
If we excite a hydrogen atom with white light instead of<br>
heat, we can produce the absorption phenomenon that we<br>mentioned earlier Each electron jump from an inner shell to<br>a shell farther out requires a certain amount of energy, no<br>more and no less An electron jump from shell one to shell<br>two requires a certain amount of energy, and only that amount<br>
The same is true for a jump from shell five to shell seven, etc<br>
Each jump that the electron makes from an inner shell to an<br>outer shell takes a specific amount of energy, no more and no<br>
less<br>
When we shine white light on a hydrogen atom, we are<br>
offering it a whole supermarket of different energy amounts<br>
However, it cannot use all that we have to offer, only certain<br>
specific amounts If its electron jumps from shell one to shell<br>four, for example, it takes that particular energy package out<br>of the array of energy packets that we are giving it The<br>package that it takes out becomes a black line in the otherwise<br>
complete spectrum of white light A jump from shell three to<br>shell four becomes another black line A jump from shell one<br>
to shell two, and then from shell two to shell six (there are all<br>sorts of combinations) makes two more black lines<br>
In sum, if we shine white light through hydrogen gas and<br>
then through a prism, the result is the familiar white-light<br>spectrum, but with over one hundred black lines in it Each<br>of these black lines corresponds to a specific energy amount<br>that was required to make a hydrogen electron jump from one<br>shell to another shell farther out<br>
These black lines in the white-light spectrum form exactly<br>
the same pattern that we get when we shine the light emitted<br>from excited hydrogen gas directly through a prism—except,<br>in that case, the lines are colored and the rest of the white-<br>light spectrum is missing Of course, the colored lines are<br>caused by the electrons returning to lower-level shells and, in<br>the process, emitting energy amounts equal to what they ab-<br>sorbed when we first made them lump Bohr's theorv<br>

ted physicists to calculate the frequencies of the<br>

by simple hydrogen atoms These calculations agreed with<br>
observations The grand-piano mystery was solved'<br>
Shortly after Bohr published his theory in 1913, an army of<br>
physicists began the work of<br>
 it to the other elements<br>
This process was quite complicated for atoms with large num-<br>bers of electrons, and not all of the questions that physicists<br>had about the nature of atomic phenomena were answered<br>
Nonetheless, a tremendous amount of knowledge was gained<br>
from this work Most of the physicists who went to work on<br>
Bohr's theory, applying it and further developing it, were<br><i>technicians</i> Bohr himself, one of the founders of the new<br>
physics, was a<br>
This is not to say that technicians are not important The<br>
technician and the scientist form a partnership Bohr could<br>not have formulated his theory without the wealth of spectro-<br>scopic data at his disposal That data was the result of count-<br>less laboratory hours It was beyond Bohr s capacity, as one<br>
person, to substantiate his theory Technicians did this for<br>him bv applying it to the other elements Technicians are<br>important members of the scientific<br>
 However,<br>
since this is a book about Wu Li Masters and not about<br>technicians, we will use the word ' physicist&quot; from now on to<br>mean those physicists who are also scientists, that is, those<br>
physicists (people) who are not confined bv the 'known From<br>the little that we know about Wu Li Masters, it is evident that<br>they come from this group<br>
There are certain limitations which no book on physics can<br>
overcome First, there is so much to present that not even<br>twenty volumes could contain it all There is that much<i> new<br></i>material published each year Even physicists find it impossi-<br>ble to keep abreast of the whole field It requires a steady diet<br>of reading just to keep current in one area For everything<br>that is included in these pages, there is much more that is<br>not No matter how much vou learn about physics, there<br>always will be something that is new to vou Physicists have<br>this problem, too<br>
Second, no complete appreciation of physics is possible<br>
without mathematics Nonetheless, there is no mathematics<br>in<i> The Dancing Wu Li Masters</i> Mathematics is a highly<br>structured way of thinking Physicists view the world in this<br>way One point of view is that they impose this structure on<br>
<hr>
<A name=38></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-38_1.png"><br>
16 /WU LI?<br>
what they see. Another point of view is that the world presents<br>
itself most completely through such structures. In any case,<br>mathematics is the most concise expression of physics. The<br>reason for writing<i> The Dancing Wu Li Masters,</i> however, is<br>that most physicists are not able to explain physics very well<br>
without it. This makes them very concise but, unfortunately,<br>unintelligible. The fact is that most of us use words to do our<br>explaining.<br>
However, it is important to remember that mathematics<br>
and English are both languages. Languages are useful tools<br>for conveying information, but if we try to communicate<br>experiences with them, they simply do not work. All a lan-<br>guage can do is talk<i> about</i> an experience. Wu Li Masters<br>know that a description of an experience is not the experience.<br>It is only talk about it.<br>
This is a book<i> about</i> physics. Therefore, all it contains is a<br>
description. It cannot contain the experience itself. This does<br>not mean that you will not have the experience of physics by<br>reading it; it only means that if you do, the experience is<br>coming from<i> you,</i> and not from the book. Quantum mechan-<br>ics, for example, shows us that we are not as separate from<br>the rest of the world as we once thought. Particle physics<br>shows us that the &quot;rest of the world&quot; does not sit idly &quot;out<br>there.&quot; It is a sparkling realm of continual creation, trans-<br>formation, and annihilation. The ideas of the new physics,<br>
when wholly grasped, can produce extraordinary<i> experiences.<br></i>The study of relativity theory, for example, can produce the<br>remarkable experience that space and time are only mental<br>constructions! Each of these different experiences is capable<br>of changing us in such ways that we never again are able to<br>view the world as we did before.<br>
There is no single &quot;experience&quot; of physics. The experience<br>
always is changing. Relativity and quantum mechanics, although<br>generally unknown to nonphysicists, are more than a half cen-<br>tury old. Today, the entire field of physics is quivering with<br>anticipation. The air is charged with excitement. A feeling is<br>shared among physicists that radical change is at hand. A<br>consensus grows that the near future will see new theories<br>exploding onto the scene, incorporating the older theories<br>and giving us a much larger view of our universe and, conse-<br>quently, of ourselves.<br>
The Wu Li Masters move in the midst of all this, now<br>

sometimes with a lightness and grace, ever flowing freely.<br>Now they become the dance, now the dance becomes them.<br>This is the message of the Wu Li Masters: not to confuse the<br>type of dance that they are doing with the fact that they are<br>dancing.<br>

CHAPTER<br>
1<br>
Einstein Doesn't<br>
Like It<br>
Quantum mechanics are not the fellows who repair automo-<br>biles in Mr. Quantum's garage. Quantum mechanics is a branch<br>of physics. There are several branches of physics. Most physi-<br>cists believe that sooner or later they will construct an over-<br>view large enough to incorporate them all.<br>
According to this point of view, we eventually will develop,<br>
in principle, a theory which is capable of explaining everything<br>so well that there will be nothing left to explain. This does not<br>mean, of course, that our explanation necessarily will reflect<br>the way that things actually are. We still will not be able to<br>
open the watch, as Einstein put it, but every occurrence in<br>the<i> real</i> world (inside the watch) will be accounted for by a<br>corresponding element of our final supertheory. We will have,<br>at last, a theory that is consistent within itself and which<br>explains all observable phenomena. Einstein called this state<br>the &quot;ideal limit of knowledge.&quot;'<br>
This way of thinking runs into quantum mechanics the same<br>
way that the car runs into the proverbial brick wall. Einstein<br>spent a large portion of his career arguing against quantum<br>mechanics, even though he himself made major contributions<br>to its development. Why did he do this? To ask this question<br>
is to stand at the edge of an abyss, still on the solid ground of<br>Newtonian physics, but looking into the void. To answer it is<br>to leap boldly into the new physics.<br>
Quantum mechanics forced itself upon the scene at the<br>
beginning of this century. No convention of physicists voted<br>

<b>EINSTEIN DOESNT LIKE IT / 19</b><br>
to start a new branch of physics called &quot;quantum mechanics.&quot;<br>No one had any choice in the matter, except, perhaps, what<br>to call it.<br>
A &quot;quantum&quot; is a quantity of something, a specific amount.<br>
&quot;Mechanics&quot; is the study of motion. Therefore, &quot;quantum me-<br>chanics&quot; is the study of the motion of quantities. Quantum<br>theory says that nature comes in bits and pieces (quanta), and<br>quantum mechanics is the study of this phenomenon.<br>
Quantum mechanics does not replace Newtonian physics, it<br>
includes it. The physics of Newton remains valid within its<br>limits. To say that we have made a major new discovery about<br>nature is one side of a coin. The other side of the coin is to say<br>that we have found the limits of our previous theories. What<br>we actually discover is that the way that we have been looking<br>at nature is no longer comprehensive enough to explain all<br>that we can observe, and we are forced to develop a more<br>inclusive view. In Einstein's words:<br>
. . . creating a new theory is not like destroying an old<br>
barn and erecting a skyscraper in its place. It is rather<br>like climbing a mountain, gaining new and wider views,<br>discovering unexpected connections between our starting<br>point and its rich environment. But the point from which<br>
we started out still exists and can be seen, although it<br>appears smaller and forms a tiny part of our broad view<br>gained by the mastery of the obstacles on our adventurous<br>way up.<br>
Newtonian physics still is applicable to the large-scale world,<br>
but it does not work in the subatomic realm. Quantum me-<br>chanics resulted from the study of the subatomic realm, that<br>invisible universe underlying, embedded in, and forming the<br>fabric of everything around us.<br>
In Newton's age (late 1600s), this realm was entirely<br>
speculation. The idea that the atom is the indivisible building<br>block of nature was proposed about four hundred years before<br>Christ, but until the late 1800s it remained just an idea. Then<br>physicists developed the technology to observe the effects of<br>atomic phenomena, thereby &quot;proving&quot; that atoms exist. Of<br>course, what they really proved was that the theoretical<br>existence of atoms was the best explanation of the experimental<br>data that anyone could invent at the time. They also proved<br>that atoms are not indivisible, but themselves are made of<br>

particles smaller yet, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons<br>These new particles were labeled 'elementary particles&quot; be-<br>cause physicists believed that, at last, they really had discovered<br>the ultimate building blocks of the universe<br>
The elementarv particle theory is a recent version of an old<br>
Greek idea To understand the theory of elementary particles,<br>imagine a large city made entirely of bricks This citv is filled<br>with buildings of all shapes and sizes Every one of them, and<br>the streets as well, have been constructed with only a few<br>different tvpes of brick If we substitute &quot;universe' for &quot;city&quot;<br>and &quot;particle&quot; for &quot;brick,&quot; we have the theory of elementary<br>particles<br>
It was the studv of elementary particles that brought physi-<br>
cists nose to nose with the most devastating (to a physicist)<br>discovery<i> Newtonian</i><br>
<i> does not work in the realm of</i><br>
<i>the very</i><br>
 The impact of that earthshakmg discovery still<br>
is reshaping our world view Quantum mechanical experiments<br>repeatedly produced results which the physics of Newton could<br>neither predict nor explain Yet, although Newton s physics<br>could not account for phenomena in the microscopic realm, it<br>continued to explain macroscopic phenomena verv well (even<br>though the macroscopic is made of the microscopic)' This was<br>perhaps the most profound discovery of science<br>
Newton s laws are based upon observations of the ev eryday<br>
world They predict events These events pei tarn to real things<br>like baseballs and bicycles Quantum mechanics is based upon<br>experiments conducted in the subatomic realm It predicts<br>probabilities These probabilities pertain to subatomic phe-<br>nomena Subatomic phenomena cannot be observed directly<br>None of our senses can detect them * Not only has no one<br>ever seen an atom (much less an electron), no one has ever<br>tasted, touched, heard, or smelled one either<br>
Newton's laws depict events which are simple to understand<br>
and easy to picture Quantum mechanics depicts the proba-<br>bilities of phenomena which defy conceptualization and are<br>impossible to<br>
 Therefore, these phenomena must be<br>
understood in a way that is not more difficult than our usual<br>
way of understanding, but different from it Do not try to<br>
make a complete mental picture of quantum mechanical events<br>

(Physicists make partial pictures of quantum phenomena, but<br>even these pictures have a questionable value) Instead, allow<br>yourself to be open without making an effort to visualize any-<br>thing Werner Heisenberg, one of the founders of quantum<br>physics, wrote<br>
The mathematically formulated laws of quantum theory<br>show clearly that our ordinary intuitive concepts cannot<br>be unambiguously applied to the smallest particles All<br>the words or concepts we use to describe ordinary physi-<br>cal objects, such as position, velocity, color, size, and so<br>on, become indefinite and problematic if we trv to use<br>them of elementary particles 3<br>
The idea that we do not understand something until we<br>
have a picture of it in our heads is a by-product of the<br>Newtonian way of looking at the world If we want to get past<br>Newton, we have to get past that<br>
Newton's first great contribution to science was the laws of<br>
motion If an object, said Newton, is moving in a straight line,<br>it will continue moving in a straight line forever unless it is<br>acted upon bv something else (a &quot;force&quot;) At that time its<br>
direction and speed will be altered, depending upon the mag-<br>nitude and direction of the force which it encounters Fur-<br>thermore, every action is accompanied by an equal and opposite<br>reaction<br>
Today, these concepts are familiar to anyone who has studied<br>
physics or hung out in a pool hall However, if we mentally<br>project ourselves three hundred years into the past, we can<br>see how remarkable they really are<br>
First, Newton's first law of motion defied the accepted au-<br>
thority of the day, which was Aristotle According to Aristotle,<br>the natural inclination for a moving object is to return to a<br>state of rest<br>
Second, Newton's laws of motion describe events which<br>
were unobservable in the 1600s In the everyday world, which<br>was all that Newton had to observe, moving objects always<i> do<br></i>return to a state of rest because of friction If we put a wagon<br>in motion, it encounters friction from the air through which it<br>passes, from the ground its tires move on, from the axles that<br>its wheels turn around, and, unless it is rolling downhill,<br>sooner or later it comes to rest We can streamline the wagon,<br>

grease the whetls and use a smooth road, but this only re-<br>duces the effect of friction Eventually the wagon stops mov-<br>ing, apparently on its own<br>
Newton never had the chance to see a film of astronauts in<br>
space, but he predicted what thev would encounter When an<br>astronaut releases a pencil in front of him nothing happens It<br>
just stays there If he gives it a push, off it goes in the direc-<br>
tion of the push until it bumps into a wall If the wall were<br>not there, the pencil would continue to move uniformly in<br>
principle, forever (The astionaut also moves off in the oppo-<br>
site direction, but much more slowlv because of his greater<br>mass)<br>
Third Newton s premise was I make no hypotheses ( Hv-<br>
pothtses non fingo ) which means that he based his laws<br>upon sound experimental evidence and nothing else His<br>criteria for the validity of everything that he wrote was that<br>anyone should be able to reproduce his expciiments and come<br>up with the same results If it could be verified experimentally<br>it was true If it could not be verified experimentally it was<br>suspect<br>
The church took a dim view to sav the least of this position<br>
Since it had been saving things for fifteen hundred<br>
 which<br>
hardly were subject to experimental verification, Newtonian<br>physics, in effect, was a direct challenge to the power of the<br>church The power of the church was considerable * Shortly<br>before Newton s birth Galileo was<br>
 by the Inquisition<br>
for declaring that the earth revolves around the sun and for<br>drawing unacceptable theological implications from his beliefs<br>
He was forced to lecant on penalty of imprisonment or worse<br>
This made a considerable impression on man&gt; people, among<br>them another founder of modern science, the Frenchman<br>
Rene Descartes<br>
In the 1630s Descartes visited the royal gardens at Versailles,<br>
which were known for their intricate automata When water<br>was made to flow, music sounded, sea nymphs began to plav<br>and a giant Neptune, complete with trident advanced menac-<br>

not Descartes's philosophy, which he supported with his math-<br>ematics, became that the universe and all of the things in it<br>also were automata From Descartes s time to the beginning of<br>this century, and perhaps because of him, our ancestors began<br>to see the universe as a Great Machine Over the next three<br>
hundred years they developed science specifically to discover<br>how the Great Machine worked<br>
Newton's second great contribution to science was his law<br>
of gravity Gravity is a remarkable phenomenon, even though<br>we take it for granted For example, if we hold a ball off the<br>ground, and then release it, the ball falls straight down to the<br>ground But how did that<br>
 The ground did not reach<br>
up and pull the ball down, yet the ball was pulled to the<br>earth The old physics called this unexplamable phenomenon<br>
'action-at-a-distance Newton himself was as puzzled as any-<br>
one He wrote in his famous<i> Philosophiae Naturahf, Principia<br>Mathematica</i><br>
I have not been able to discover the cause of those<br>
properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no<br>hypotheses it is enough that gravity does really exist,<br>and act according to the laws which we have explained,<br>and abundantly serves to account for all the motions of<br>the celestial bodies 4<br>
Newton clearly felt that a true understanding of the nature<br>
of gravity was beyond comprehension In a letter to Richard<br>
Bentlv a<br>
 scholar he wrote<br>
that one body may act upon another at a distance<br>
through a vacuum without the mediation of anything else,<br>by and through which their action and force may be<br>
conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an ab-<br>surdity that, I believe, no man who has m philosophic<br>
matters a competent fatuity of thinking could ever fall<br>
In short, action-at-a-distance could be described, but it could<br>not be explained<br>
Newton s thesis was that the same force which pulls apples<br>
downward also keeps the moon in orbit around the earth and<br>the planets in orbit around the sun To test his idea, he<br>calculated various movements of the moon and the planets,<br>using his own mathematics Then he compared his findings<br>

with the observations of astronomers His calculations and<br>their observations matched' In one stroke Newton set aside<br>the assumption of an essential difference between earthly and<br>heavenly objects by showing that both of them are governed<br>by the same laws He established a rational celestial mechan-<br>
ics What had been the purview of the gods, or God, came<br>now within the comprehension of mortals Newton s gravita-<br>tional law does not explain gravity (that was done by Einstein<br>in his general theory of relativitv) but it does subject the<br>
effects of gravity to a rigorous mathematical formalism<br>
Newton was the first person to discover principles in nature<br>
which unify large tracts of experience He abstracted certain<br>
unifying concepts from the endless diversity of nature and<br>gave those concepts mathematical expression Because of this,<br>more than anything else, Newton s work has influenced us so<br>
forcefully Newton showed us that the phenomena of the<br>universe are structured in rationally comprehensible ways<br>He gave us the most powerful tool in historv In the West we<br>have used this tool, if not wisely, certainly to the best of our<br>ability The results, both positive and negative have been<br>spectacular The story of our enormous impact on our environ-<br>
ment begins with the work of Newton<br>
It was Galileo Galilei who following the Middle Ages, first<br>
quantified the physical world He measured the motion, fre-<br>quency, velocitv, and duration of everything from falling stones<br>to swinging pendulums (like the chandelier in his cathedral)<br>It was Rene Descartes who developed many of the fundamental<br>techniques of modern mathematics and gave us the picture of<br>the universe as a Great Machine It was Isaac Newton who<br>formulated the laws by which the Great Machine runs<br>
These men struck boldly against the grip of scholasticism,<br>
the medieval thought system of the 12th to the 15th centu-<br>ries They attempted to place man at the center of the<br>stage, or at least back on the stage to prove to him that he<br>need not be a bystander in a world governed by unfathomable<br>
forces It is perhaps the greatest irony of history that they<br>accomplished just the opposite<br>

How did this<br>
Newton s laws of motion describe what happens to a mov-<br>
ing object Once we know the laws of motion we can predict<br>the future of a moving object provided that we know certain<br>things about it initially The more initial information that we<br>have, the more accurate our predictions will be We also can<br>retrodict (predict backward in time) the past history of a given<br>object For example, if we know the present position and<br>velocity of the earth, the moon and the sun, we<br>
 predict<br>
where the earth will be in relation to the moon and the sun at<br>any particular time in the future, giving us a foreknowledge of<br>eclipses, seasons and so on In like manner, we can calculate<br>where the earth has been in relation to the moon and the sun,<br>and when similar phenomena occurred in the past<br>
Without Newtonian physics the space program would not<br>
be possible Moon probes are launched at the precise mo-<br>ment when the launch site on the earth (which simultaneously<br>is rotating around its axis and moving forward through space)<br>is in a position relative to the landing zone on the moon<br>(which also is rotating and moving) such that the path traversed<br>by the spacecraft is the shortest possible The calculations of the<br>earth, moon, and spacecraft movements are done by computer,<br>but the mechanics used are the same ones that are described<br>
in Newton's<i> Phtlosophiae Naturahs Prmcipia Mathematica</i><br>
In practice, it is very difficult to know all the initial circum-<br>
stances pertaining to an event Even a simple action such as<br>bouncing a ball off a wall is surprisingly complex The shape<br>size, elasticity and momentum of the ball, the angle at which<br>it was thrown, the density pressure humidit\ and temperature<br>of the air, the shape, hardness and position of the wall, to<br>name a few of the essential elements are all required to know<br>where and when the ball will land It is increasingly difficult<br>to obtain all of the data necessary for accurate predictions<br>
when more complex actions are involved According to the<br>old physics, however, it is possible, in principle, to predict<br><i>exactly</i> how a given event is going to unfold if we have enough<br>information about it In practice, it is only the enormity of the<br>task that prevents us from accomplishing it<br>

The ability to predict the future based on a knowledge of<br>
the present and the laws of motion gave our ancestors a power<br>they had never known However, these concepts carry within<br>them a very dispiriting logic If the laws of nature determine<br>the future of an event, then, given enough information, we<br>
could have predicted our present at some time in the past<br>That time in the past also could have been predicted at a time<br>still earlier In short, if we are to accept the mechanistic<br>determination of Newtonian physics—if the universe really is<br>a great machine—then from the moment that the universe<br>was created and set into motion, everything that was to hap-<br>pen in it already was determined<br>
According to this philosophy, we may seem to have a will of<br>
our own and the ability to alter the course of events in our<br>lives, but we do not Everything, from the beginning of time,<br>
has been predetermined, including our illusion of having a<br>free will The universe is a prerecorded tape playing itself out<br>in the only way that it can The status of men is immeasurably<br>more dismal than it was before the advent of science The<br>Great Machine runs blindly on, and all things in it are but<br>cogs<br>
According to quantum mechanics, however, it is not possible,<br>
<i>even tn principle,</i> to know enough about the present to make<br>a complete prediction about the future Even if we have the<br>time and the determination, it is not possible Even if we<br>have the best possible measuring devices, it is not possible<br>It is not a matter of the size of the task or the inefficiency of<br>detectors The very nature of things is such that we must<br>choose which aspect of them we wish to know best, for we can<br>know<br>
 one of them with precision<br>
As Niels Bohr, another founder of quantum mechanics, put<br>
it<br>
in quantum mechanics, we are not dealing with an<br>
arbitrary renunciation of a more detailed analysis of atomic<br>phenomena, but with a recognition that such an analysis<br>is tn<i> principle</i> excluded 7 (Italics in the original)<br>
For example, imagine an object moving through space It<br>
has both a position and a momentum which we can measure<br>This is an example of the old (Newtonian) physics (Momen-<br>tum is a combination of how big an object is, how fast it is<br>going and the direction that it is moving) Since we can<br>

determine both the position and the momentum of the object<br>at a particular time, it is not a very difficult affair to calculate<br>where it will be at some point in the future If we see an<br>airplane flying north at two hundred miles per hour, we know<br>that in one hour it will be two hundred miles farther north if<br>it does not change its course or speed<br>
The mind-expanding discovery of quantum mechanics is<br>
that Newtonian physics does not apply to subatomic phe-<br>nomena In the subatomic realm, we cannot know both the<br>position<i> and</i> the momentum of a particle with absolute<br>precision We can know both, approximately but the more<br>we know about one, the less we know about the other We<br>
can know either of them precisely but in that case, we can<br>know nothing about the other This is Werner Heisenberg s<br>uncertainty principle As incredible as it seems, it has been<br>verified repeatedly by experiment<br>
Of course, if we picture a moving particle, it is very difficult<br>
to imagine not being able to measure both its position and<br>momentum Not to be able to do so defies our common<br>sense<br>
 is not the only quantum mechanical phenomenon<br>
which eonti idicts common sense Commonsense contradictions,<br>
in fact, are a. the heart of the new physics Thev tell us again<br>and again that the world may not be what we think it is It<br>may be much much more<br>
Since we cannot determine both the position and momen-<br>
tum of subatomic particles, we cannot predict much about<br>them Accordingly, quantum mechanics does not and cannot<br>
predict specific events It does, however predict<i> probabilities<br></i>Probabilities are the odds that something is going to happen,<br>or that it is not going to happen Quantum theory can predict<br>the probability of a microscopic event with the same precision<br>that Newtonian physics can predict the actual occurrence of a<br>macroscopic event<br>
Newtonian physics savs, If such and such is the case now,<br>
then such and such is going to happen next Quantum me-<br>
chanics says, 'If such and such is the case now, then the<br><i>probability</i> that such and such is going to happen next is<br>(whatever it is calculated to be) ' We never can know with<br>certainty what will happen to the particle that we are observ-<br>ing ' All that we can know for sure are the probabilities for it<br>to behave in certain ways This is the most that we can know<br>because the two data which must be included in a Newtonian<br>calculation, position and momentum, cannot both be known<br>

with precision<i> We must choose,</i> by the selection of our<br>experiment, which one we want to measure most accurately<br>
The lesson of Newtonian phvsics is that the universe is<br>
governed by laws that are susceptible to rational understanding<br>
By applying these laws we extend our knowledge of, and<br>therefore our influence over, our environment Newton was a<br>religious person He saw his laws as manifestations of God's<br>perfection Nonetheless Newton s laws served man s cause<br>
well They enhanced his dignity and vindicated his impor-<br>tance in the universe Following the Middle Ages, the new<br>field of science<i> ('</i> Natural Philosophy ) came like a fresh breeze<br>to revitah/e the spirit It is ironic that, in the end, Natural<br>
Philosophy reduced the status of men to that of helpless cogs<br>
in a machine whose functioning had been preordained from<br>the day of its creation<br>
Contrary to Newtonian physics, quantum mechanics tells<br>
us that our knowledge of what governs events on the subatomic<br>level is not nearly what we assumed it would be It tells us<br>that we cannot predict subatomic phenomena with any cer-<br>tainty We only can predict their probabilities<br>
Philosophically, however, the implications of quantum me-<br>
chanics are psychedelic Not only do we influence our reality,<br>but, in some degree, we actually<i> create</i> it Because it is the<br>nature of things that we can know either the momentum of a<br>particle or its position, but not both,<i> we must choose</i> which<br>of these two properties we want to determine<br>this is very close to saying that we<i> create</i> certain properties<br>because we choose to measure those properties Said another<br>way, it is possible that we create something that has position,<br>for example, like a particle because we are intent on deter-<br>mining position and it is impossible to determine position<br>
without having some<i> thing</i> occupying the position that we<br>
 to determine<br>
Quantum physicists ponder questions like, Did a particle<br>
with momentum exist before we conducted an experiment to<br>
measure its<br>
 Did a particle with position exist<br>
before we conducted an experiment to measure its<br>
 ,<br>
and Did anv particles exist at all before we thought about<br>them and measured them? '<i> Did we create the particles that<br>we are</i><br>
 Incredible as it sounds this is a<br>
possibility that many physicists recognize<br>

May the universe in some strange sense be brought into<br>
being by the participation of those who<br>
The vital act is the act of participation Participator is<br>
the incontrovertible new concept given by quantum me-<br>chanics It strikes down the term observer of classical<br>theory, the man who stands safely behind the thick glass<br>wall and watches what goes on without taking part It<br>can t be done, quantum mechanics says 8<br>
The languages of eastern mystics and western physicists are<br>becoming very similar<br>
Newtonian physics and quantum mechanics are partners in<br>
a double irony Newtonian phvsics is based upon the idea of<br>laws which govern phenomena and the power inherent in<br>understanding them but it leads to impotence in the face of a<br>Great Machine which is the universe Quantum mechanics is<br>based upon the idea of minimal knowledge of future phenomena<br>(we are limited to knowing probabilities) but it leads to the<br>possibility that our reahtv is what we choose to make it<br>
There is another fundamental difference between the old<br>
physics and the new physics The old phvsics assumes that<br>there is an external world which exists apart from us It fur-<br>ther assumes that we can observe measure and speculate<br>about the external world without changing it According to<br>the old physics the external world is indifferent to us and to<br>our needs<br>
Galileo s historical stature stems from his tireless (and<br>
successful) efforts to quantify (measure) the phenomena of the<br>external world There is great power inherent in the process<br>
of quantification For example once a relationship is discovered<br>
like the rate of acceleration of a falling object it matters not<br>who drops the object what object is dropped or where the<br>dropping takes place The results are always the same An<br>experimenter in Italv gets the same results as a Russian<br>experimenter who repeats the experiment a centurv later<br>
The results are the same whether the experiment is done bv a<br>skeptic, a believer, or a curious<br>

universe goes unheedmglv on its way doing what it must,<br>without regard for its inhabitants For example, if we simulta-<br>neously drop two people from the same height, it is a verifiable<br>

(repeatable) fact that they both will hit the ground at the same<br>time, regardless of their weights We can measure their fall,<br>acceleration, and impact the same way that we measure the<br>fall, acceleration and impact of stones In fact, the results will<br>be the same as if they<br>
 stones<br>
&quot;But there is a difference between people and stones'' you<br>
might say 'Stones have no opinions or emotions People have<br>both One of these dropped people, for example,<br>

No The feelings of our subjects matter not in the least<br>
When we take them up the tower again (struggling this time)<br>
and drop them off again, thev fall with the same acceleration<br>and duration that thev did the first time, even though now, of<br>course, they are both fighting mad The Great Machine is<br>impersonal In fact, it was precisely this impersonality that<br>inspired scientists to strive for 'absolute objectivity &quot;<br>
The concept of scientific objectivity rests upon the assumption<br>
of an external world which is &quot;out there&quot; as opposed to an &quot;I&quot;<br>which is ' in here &quot; (This way of perceiving, which puts other<br>people ' out there, ' makes it very lonely &quot;in here &quot;) According<br>to this view, Nature, in all her diversity, is ' out there &quot; The<br>task of the scientist is to observe the 'out there&quot; as objectively<br>as possible To observe something objectively means to see it<br>as it would appear to an observer who has no prejudices about<br>
what he observes<br>
The problem that went unnoticed for three centuries is that<br>
a person who carries such an attitude certainly is prejudiced<br>His prejudice is to be &quot;objective,&quot; that is, to be without a<br>preformed opinion In fact, it is impossible to be without an<br>opinion An opinion is a point of view The point of view that<br>we can be without a point of view is a point of view The<br>
decision itself to study one segment of reality instead of an-<br>other is a subjective expression of the<br>
 who makes<br>
it It affects his perceptions of reality, if nothing else Since<br>reality is what we are studying, the matter gets very sticky<br>
here<br>
The new physics, quantum mechanics, tells us clearly that<br>
it is not possible to observe reality without changing it If we<br>observe a certain particle collision experiment, not only do we<br>have no way of proving that the result would have been the<br>same if we had not been watching it, all that we know indi-<br>

would bt impossible to see the nucleus of an atom the size of<br>a room To see the nucleus of an atom the atom would have<br>to be as high as a fourteen-storv building' The nucleus of an<br>atom as high as a fourteen-story building would be about the size<br>of a gram of salt Since a nuclear particle has about 2,000 times<br>more mass than an electron the electrons revolving around<br>this nucleus would be about as massive as dust particles'<br>

come manifest under certain conditions are probabilities, this<br>brings<br>
 to the matter (no pun) of statistics<br>
Because there are millions of millions of subatomic particles<br>
in the smallest space that we can see, it is convenient to deal<br>
with them statistically Statistical descriptions are pictures of<br>
crowd behavior Statistics cannot tell us how one individual in<br>a crowd will behave, but they can give us a fairK accurate<br>description, based on repeated observations, of how a group<br>as a whole behaves<br>
For example a statistical studv of population growth may<br>
tell us how many children were lx&gt;rn in each of several vears<br>and how many are predicted to be born in years to come<br>However, the statistics cannot tell us which families will have<br>the new children and which ones will not If we want to know<br>the behavior of traffic at an intersection, we can install devices<br>thei e to gather data The statistics that these devices provide<br>may tell us how many cars, for instance, turn left during<br>
certain hours, but not<i> which</i> cars<br>
Statistics is used in Newtonian physics It is used, for<br>
example, to explain the relationship between gas volume and<br>pressure This relation is named Boyle's Law after its discoverer,<br>Robert Bovle, who lived in Newton's time It could as easily<br>be known as the Bicycle Pump Law as we shall see Boyle's<br>
Law says that if the volume of a container holding a given<br>
amount of gas at a constant temperature is reduced by one<br>half the pressure exerted by the gas in the container doubles<br>
Imagine a person with a bicycle pump He has pulled the<br>

of the pump cylinder is now one half of its original<br>
 and<br>
no air has been allowed to escape, because the hose is<br>
connected to a pressure gauge The gauge now reads 29 4<br>pounds per square inch or twice the original pressure Next<br>we push the plunger two thirds of the way down The interior<br>volume of the pump cylinder is now one third of its original<br>size, and the pressure gauge reads three tunes the original<br>pressure (44 1 pounds per square inch) This is Boyle s Law<br>At a constant temperature the pressure of a quantity of gas is<br>inversely proportional to its volume If the volume is reduced<br>to one half, the pressure doubles if the volume is reduced to<br>one third, the pressure triple &gt; etc To explain why this is so,<br>we come to classical statistics<br>
The air (a gas) in our pump is composed of millions of<br>
molecules (molecules are made of atoms) These molecules<br>are in constant motion and at any given time, millions of<br>them are banging into the pump walls Although we do not<br>detect each single collision the macroscopic effect of these<br>millions of impacts on a square inch of the pump wall produces<br>the phenomenon of pressure on it If we reduce the volume<br>of the pump<br>
 by one half we crowd the gas molecules<br>
into a space twice as small as the original one thereby causing<br>twice as many impacts on the same square inch of pump wall<br>
The macroscopic effect of this is a doubling of the pressure<br>
By crowding the molecules into one third of the original space,<br>
we cause three tunes as many molecules to bang into the<br>same square inch of pump wall, and the pressure on it<br>triples This is the kinetic theory of gases<br>
In other words, pressure results from the group behavior<br>
of a large number of molecules in motion It is a collection of<br>individual events Each individual event can be<br>
 be-<br>
cause, according to Newtonian physics, each individual event<br>is theoretically subject to deterministic laws In principle, we<br>can calculate the path of each molecule in the pump chamber<br>This is how statistics is used in the old physics<br>
Quantum mechanics also uses statistics, but there is a very<br>
big difference between quantum mechanics and Newtonian<br>physics In quantum mechanics, there is no way to predict<br>individual events This is the startling lesson that experiments<br>in the subatomic realm have taught us<br>
Therefore, quantum mechanics concerns itself only with<br>

 law that we know of which governs<br>
this selection Which atoms decav is purely a matter of chance<br>Nonetheless radium continues to decay, on schedule as it<br>were, with a precise and unvarying half life of sixteen hundred<br>
years Quantum theory dispenses with the laws governing the<br>disintegration of individual radium atoms and proceeds directly<br>to the statistical laws governing the disintegration of radium<br>atoms as a group This is how statistics is used in the new<br>physics<br>
Another good example of predictable overall (statistical)<br>
behavior consisting of unpredictable individual events is the<br>constant variation of<br>
 among spectral lines Remem-<br>
ber that, according to Bohrs theory, the electrons of an atom<br>

are located only in shells which are specific distances from the<br>
nucleus (page 12) Normally, the single electron of a hydrogen<br>
atom remains in the shell closest to the nucleus (the ground<br>state) If we excite it (add energy to it) we cause it to jump to<br>a shell farther out The more energy we give it, the farther<br>out it jumps If we stop exciting it, the electron jumps inward<br>to a shell closer to the nucleus, eventually returning all the<br>wav to the innermost shell With each jump from an oufer<br>shell to an inner shell, the electron emits an energy amount<br>equal to the energy amount that it absorbed when we caused<br>it to jump outward These emitted energy packets (photons)<br>constitute the light which, when dispersed through a prism,<br>forms the spectrum of one hundred or so colored lines that is<br>peculiar to hydrogen Each colored line in the hydrogen<br>spectrum is made from the light emitted from hydrogen<br>electrons as they jump from a particulai outer shell to a par-<br>ticular inner shell<br>
What we did not mention earlier is that some of the lines in<br>
the hydrogen spectrum are more pronounced than others<br>
The lines that are more pronounced are always more pro-<br>
nounced and the lines that are faint are always faint The<br>intensity of the lines in the hydrogen spectrum vanes because<br>hydrogen electrons returning to the ground state do not al-<br>ways take the same route<br>
Shell five, for example may be a more popular stopover<br>
than shell three In that case the spectrum produced by<br>millions of excited hydrogen atoms will show a more pro-<br>nounced spectral line corresponding to electron jumps from<br>shell five to shell one and a less pronounced spectral line<br>
corresponding to electron jumps from, say, shell three to shell<br>one That is because, in this example, more electrons stop<br>over at shell five before jumping to shell one than stop over at<br>shell three before jumping to shell one<br>
In other words, the probability is very high, in this example,<br>
that the electrons of excited hydrogen atoms will stop at shell<br>five on their way back to shell one and the<br>
 is<br>
lower that they will stop at shell three Said another way, we<br>know that a certain number of electrons probably will stop at<br>shell five and that a certain lesser number of electrons probably<br>will stop at shell three Still we have no wav of knowing<br><i>which</i> electrons will stop where As before, we can describe<br>precisely an overall behavior without being able to predict a<br>single one of the individual events which comprise it<br>

describes the overall behavior and/or predicts the probabilities<br>of the individual behavior of<br>
In the autumn of 1927, physicists working with the new<br>
physics met in Brussels Belgium, to ask themselves this ques-<br>tion, among others What they decided there became known<br>as the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics *<br>Other interpretations developed later, but the Copenhagen<br>Interpretation marks the emergence of the new<br>
 as a<br>
consistent way of viewing the world It is still the most prevalent<br>interpretation of the mathematical formalism of quantum me-<br>chanics The upheaval in physics following the discovery of<br>
the inadequacies of Newtonian physics was all but complete<br>
The question among the physicists at Brussels was not whether<br>
Newtonian mechanics could be adapted to subatomic phe-<br>nomena (it was clear that it could not be), but rather, what<br>
was to replace it<br>
The Copenhagen Interpretation was the first consistent for-<br>
mulation of quantum mechanics Einstein opposed it in 1927<br>
and he argued against it until his death, although he, like all<br>
physicists, was forced to acknowledge its advantages in<br>explaining subatomic phenomena<br>
The Copenhagen Interpretation says, in effect, that<i> it does</i><br>
<i>not matter</i> what quantum mechanics is<br>
 The important<br>
thing is that it works in all possible experimental situations<br>
This is one of the most important statements in the history of<br>
science The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechan-<br>ics began a monumental reunion which was all but unnoticed<br>
at the time The rational part of our psyche, typified by science,<br>began to merge again with that other part of us which we had<br>ignored since the 1700s our irrational side<br>
The scientific idea of truth traditionally had been anchored<br>
in an absolute truth somewhere out there&quot;—that is, an abso-<br>lute truth with an independent existence The closer that we<br>came in our approximations to the absolute truth, the truer<br>
* This was the 5th Solvay Congress at which Bohr and Einstein conducted their<br>now famous debates The term Copenhagen Interpretation reflects the dominant<br>influence of Niels Bohr (from Copenhagen) and his school of thought<br>t The Copenhagen Interpretation says that quantum theory is about correlations in<br>
our experiences It is about what will be observed under specified conditions<br>

our theories were said to be Although we might never be<br>able to perceive the absolute truth directly—or to open the<br>watch, as Einstein put it—still we tried to construct theories<br>suth that for every facet of absolute truth, there was a<br>corresponding element in our theories<br>
The Copenhagen Interpretation does<br>
 with this idea of<br>
a one-to-one correspondence between reality and theory This<br>is another way of saying what we have said before Quantum<br>mechanics discards the laws governing individual events and<br>states directly the laws governing aggregations It is very<br>pragmatic<br>
The philosophy of pragmatism goes something like this<br>
The mind is such that it deals only with ideas It is not possible<br>for the mind to relate to am thing other than ideas Therefore,<br>it is not correct to think that the mind actually can ponder<br>reality All that the mind can ponder is its<i> ideas</i> about reality<br>(Whether or not that is the way reality actually is, is a meta-<br>physical issue) Therefore, whether or not something is true is<br>not a matter of how closely it corresponds to the absolute<br>truth but of how consistent it is with our experience *<br>
The extraordinary importance of the Copenhagen Interpre-<br>
tation lies in the fact that for the first time, scientists attempting<br>to formulate a consistent physics were forced by their own<br>findings to acknowledge that a complete understanding of reality<br>lies beyond the capabilities of rational thought It was this<br>that Einstein could not accept The most incomprehensible<br>thing about the world he wrote, 'is that it is comprehensi-<br>ble n But the deed was done The new physics was based<br>not upon absolute truth but upon<i> us</i><br>
Henry Pierce Stapp a physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley<br>
Laboratory expressed this eloquently<br>
* The philosophy of pragmatism was cicated by the Amencan<br>William James Recently the pragmatic aspects of the Copenhagen<br>tion of Quantum Mechanics have been emphasized b\ Henrv Picice Stapp a<br>theoretical physicist at the Lawrence Bcikeley Laboratory in Berkeley C ahfoi<br>ma The Copenhagen Interpretation in addition to the pragmatic part<br>
 the<br>
claim that quantum theory is in some sense complete that no<br>
 can<br>
explain subatomic phenomena in any more det ul<br>
An essential feature of the Copenhagen Intel pi etation is Bohi s ptmciple of<br>
complementarity (to be discussed later) Some historians practically equate the<br>Copenhagen Interpretation and complementarity Complementarity is sub<br>sumed in a geneial way in Stapp s pragmatic mtei pi etation ol quantum me<br>

[The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum<br>
was essentially a rejection of the presumption that nature<br>could be understood in terms of elementary space-time<br>
realities According to the<br>
 view, the complete de-<br>
scription of nature at the atomic level was given bv<br>probabiliU functions that referred not to underlying mi-<br>
croscopic<br>
 realities but rather to the macroscopic<br>
objects of sense experience The theoretical structure<br>did not extend down and anchor itself on fundamental<br>microscopic space-time realities Instead it turned back<br>and anchored itself in the concrete sense realities that<br>form the basis of social life This pragmatic descrip-<br>tion is to be contrasted with descriptions that attempt to<br>peer behind the scenes and tell us what is really<br>happening 12<br>
Another way of understanding the Copenhagen Interpreta-<br>
tion (in retrospect) is in terms of split-brain analysis The<br>human brain is divided into two halves which are connected<br>at the center of the cerebral cavity by a tissue To treat cer-<br>tain conditions, such as epilepsy the two halves of the brain<br>sometimes are separated surgically From the experiences<br>reported by and the observations made of persons who have<br>undergone this surgerv we have discovered a remarkable<br>
fact<br>
 speaking the left side of our bra'n functions in<br>
a different manner than the right side Each of<br>
 brains<br>
sees the world in a different way<br>
The left side of our brain perceives the world in a linear<br>
manner It tends to organize sensory input into the form of<br>
points on a line with some points coming before others For<br>example language which is linear (the woids which you are<br>reading flow along a line from left to right) is a function of the<br>left hemisphere The left hemisphere functions logically and<br>rationally It is the left side of the brain which creates the<br>concept of causality the image that one thing causes another<br>because it alwavs precedes it The right hemisphere, by com-<br>parison perceives whole patterns<br>
Persons who have had split-brain operations actually have<br>
two separate brains When each hemisphere is tested sepa-<br>rately, it is found that the left brain remembers how to speak<br>and use words while the right brain generally cannot How-<br>ever, the right brain remembers the lyrics of songs' The left<br>side of our brain tends to ask certain questions of its sensory<br>

rational' and the right hemisphere is 'irrational &quot;13<br>
Physiologically the left hemisphere controls the right side<br>
of the body and the right hemisphere controls the left side of<br>the body In view of this, it is no coincidence that both litera-<br>ture and mythology associate the right hand (left hemisphere)<br>with rational, male, and assertive characteristics and the left<br>hand (right hemisphere) with mystical, female, and receptive<br>characteristics The Chinese wrote about the same phenomena<br>thousands of years ago (yin and yang) although they were not<br>known for their split-brain surgery<br>
Our entire societv reflects a left hemispheric bias (it is ratio-<br>
nal, masculine and assertive) It gives verv little reinforce-<br>ment to those characteristics representative of the right hemi-<br>sphere (intuitive, feminine, and receptive) The advent of<br>
science&quot; marks the beginning of the ascent of left hemispheric<br>
thinking into the dominant mode of western cognition and the<br>descent of right hemispheric thinking into the underground<br>(underpsyche) status from which it did not emerge (with<br>scientific recognition) until Freud's discovery of the uncon-<br>
scious&quot; which, of course, he labeled dark mysterious and<br>irrational (because that is how the left hemisphere \iews the<br>right hemisphere)<br>
The Copenhagen Interpretation was, in effect, a recognition<br>
of the limitations of left hemispheric thought, although the<br>
 at Brussels in 1927 could not have thought in those<br>
terms It was also a re-eogmfu&gt;n of those psychic aspects which<br>long had been ignored in a rationalistic societv After all,<br>physicists are essentially people who wonder at the universe<br>To stand in awe and wonder is to understand in a \ ery specific<br>way, even if that understanding cannot be described The<br>subjective experience of wonder is a message to the rational<br>mind that the object of wonder is being percei\ed and<br>understood in ways other than the rational<br>

CHAPTER<br>
1<br>
Living?<br>
When we talk of physics as patterns of organic energy, the<br>
word that catches our attention is &quot;organic.&quot; Organic means<br>living. Most people think that physics is about things that are<br>not living, such as pendulums and billiard balls. This is a<br>common point of view, even among physicists, but it is not as<br>evident as it may seem.<br>
Let us explore this viewpoint with the aid of a hypothetical<br>
person, a young man named Jim de Wit who is the perpetual<br>champion of the non-obvious.<br>
&quot;It is not at all true,&quot; says Jim de Wit, &quot;that physics is about<br>
nonliving things. This is evident from our discussion of falling<br>
bodies (page 29). Even if some of them are the human kind,<br>
they all accelerate at the same rate in a vacuum. So physics<br>
| does apply to living things.&quot;<br>
But that is an unfair example, we say. Rocks have no<br>
choice in the matter of falling. If we drop them, they fall. If<br>we don't drop them, they don't fall. Humans, on the other<br>hand, exercise choice. Accidents excluded, humans ordinarily<br>are not found in the act of falling. Why? Because they know<br>that falling may hurt them and they have no desire to be hurt.<br>In other words, humans process<i> information</i> (they know that<br>they may be hurt) and they<i> respond</i> to it (by not falling).<br>Rocks can do neither.&quot;<br>
&quot;That is the way things appear,&quot; says de Wit, &quot;but it may<br>
not be the way they actually are. For example, by watching<br>time-lapse photography we know that plants often respond to<br>stimulae with humanlike reactions. They retreat from pain,<br>
<b>45</b><br>

advance toward pleasure, and even languish in the absence of<br>affection. The only difference is that they do it at a much<br>slower rate than we do. So much slower, in fact, that it appears<br>to the ordinary perception that they do not react at all.<br>
&quot;If this is so, then how can we say with certainty that rocks,<br>
and even mountain ranges, do not react also as living organ-<br>isms, but with a reaction time so slow that to catch it with<br>time-lapse photography would require millennia between<br>exposures! Of course, there is no way to prove this, but there<br>is no way of disproving it either. The distinction between<br>living and nonliving is not so easy to make.&quot;<br>
&quot;That's clever,&quot; we think, &quot;but from a practical point of view,<br>
it cannot be observed that inert matter responds to stimulae,<br>and there is no question that humans do.&quot;<br>
&quot;Wrong again!&quot; says de Wit, reading our thoughts. &quot;Any<br>
chemist can verify that most chemicals (which usually come<br>out of the ground as rocks)<i> do</i> react to stimulation. Under the<br>right conditions, for example, sodium reacts to chlorine (by<br>forming sodium chloride—salt), iron reacts to oxygen (by forming<br>
iron oxides—rust), and so on, just as humans react to food<br>when they are hungry and to affection when they are lonely.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, this is so,&quot; we admit, &quot;but it hardly seems fair to<br>
compare a chemical reaction to a human reaction. A chemical<br>reaction either happens or it does not happen. There is nothing<br>in between. When two such chemicals are combined properly,<br>they react; if they are not properly combined, they do not<br>react. Humans are much more complex.<br>
&quot;If we offer food to a hungry person, he might eat it or he<br>
might not, depending upon his circumstances; and if he eats,<br>
he might eat his fill or he might not. Consider the person who<br>is hungry and late for an appointment. If the appointment is<br>important enough, he will go without eating, even though he<br>is hungry. If a person knows that his food is poisonous, he will<br>not eat, even though he is hungry. It is a matter of processing<br>information and responding appropriately that distinguishes a<br>human reaction from a chemical reaction. Chemicals have no<br>options; they always must act one way or the other.&quot;<br>
&quot;Of course,&quot; beams Jim de Wit, &quot;but how do we know that<br>
our responses are not as rigidly preprogrammed as those of a<br>chemical, with the only difference being that our programs<br>are enormously more complex? We may not have any more<br>
freedom of action than stones do, although, unlike stones, we<br>deceive ourselves into thinking that we do!&quot;<br>
<hr>
<A name=67></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-67_1.png"><br>
<IMG src="dancingmasters-67_2.png"><br>
<b>LIVING? / 47</b><br>
We have no way to dispute this argument. De Wit has<br>
shown us the arbitrary quality of our prejudices. We would<br>like to think that we are different from stones because we are<br>living and they are not, but there is no way we can prove our<br>position or disprove his. We cannot establish clearly that we<br>are different from inorganic substances. That means that, log-<br>
ically, we must admit that we may not be alive. Since this is<br>absurd, the only alternative is to admit that &quot;inanimate&quot;'' ob-<br>
jects may be living.<br>
The distinction between organic and inorganic is a concep-<br>
tual prejudice. It becomes even harder to maintain as we<br>advance into quantum mechanics. Something is organic, ac-<br>cording to our definition, if it can respond to processed infor-<br>mation. The astounding discovery awaiting newcomers to<br>
physics is that the evidence gathered in the development of<br>
quantum mechanics indicates that subatomic &quot;particles&quot;<br>
constantly appear to be making decisions! More than that, the<br>decisions they seem to make are based on decisions made<br>elsewhere. Subatomic particles seem to know<i> instantaneously<br></i>what decisions are made elsewhere, and elsewhere can be as<br>far away as another galaxy! The key word is<i> instantaneously.<br></i>How can a subatomic particle over here know what decision<br>another particle over there has made<i> at the same time the<br>particle over there makes it?</i> All the evidence belies the fact<br>that quantum particles are actually particles.<br>
A particle, as we mentally picture it (classically defined) is a<br>
thing which is confined to a region in space. It is not spread<br>out. It is either here or it is there, but it cannot be both here<br><i>and</i> there at the same time.<br>
A particle over here can communicate with a particle over<br>
there (by shouting at it, sending it a TV picture, waving,<br>
but that takes<i> time,</i> even if only milliseconds. If the two parti-<br>cles are in different galaxies, it could take centuries. For a<br>particle here to know what is going on over there while it is<br>happening, it must<i> be</i> over there. But if it is over there, it<br>cannot be here. If it is both places at once, then it is no longer<br>a particle.<br>
This means that &quot;particles&quot; may not be particles at all (page<br>
32). It also means that these apparent particles are related<br>with other particles in a dynamic and intimate way that coin-<br>cides with our definition of organic.<br>

philosophical implication of quantum mechanics is that all of<br>the things in our universe (including us) that appear to exist<br>
independently are actually parts of one all-encompassing or-<br>
ganic pattern, and that no parts of that pattern are ever really<br>separate from it or from each other<br>
To understand these decisions and what makes them, let us<br>
start with a discovery made in 1900 by Max Planck This year<br>generally is considered the birthday of quantum mechanics<br>In December of that year, Planck reluctantly presented to the<br>scientific community a paper which was to make him famous<br>He himself was displeased with the implications of his paper,<br>and he hoped that his colleagues could do what he could not<br>do explain its contents in terms of Newtonian physics He<br>
knew in his heart, however, that the) could not, and that<br>neither could anyone else He also sensed and correctlv so,<br>
that his paper would shift the veiv foundations of science<br>
What had Planck discovered that disturbed him so much''<br>
Planck had discovered that the basic structure of nature is<br>
granular, or, as physicists like to sav, discontinuous<br>
What is meant by<br>If we talk about the population of a city it is evident that it<br>
can fluctuate only by a whole number of people The least<br>
the population of a city can inciease or decrease is by one<br>
person It cannot increase by 7 of a person It can increase or<br>decrease by fifteen people but not by 15 27 people In the<br>dialect of ph) sics, a population can change only in discrete<br>increments, or discontmuously It ran get larger or smaller<br>only in jumps, and the smallest jump that it can make is a<br>whole person In general this is what Planck discovered about<br>the processes of nature<br>
Planck did not intend to undermine the foundations of<br>
Ne\\ toman physics He was a conservative German physicist<br>Rather, he madveitentlv fathered the revolution of quantum<br>mechanics by attempting to solve a specific problem dealing<br>
with<br>
 radiation<br>
Planck was searching for an explanation of whv things be-<br>
have as they do when they get hot Namely, he wanted to<br>know how objects glow brighter as they get hotter, and change<br>color when the temperature is increased or decreased<br>
Classical physics, which successfully had unified such diverse<br>
fields as acoustics, optics, and astronomy, which had all but<br>satiated the scientific appetite, which had unraveled the enigmas<br>

of the universe and rearranged them in neat packages, held<br>no sensible explanation of this commonplace phenomenon It<br>was, to use the parlance of the day, one of the few &quot;clouds&quot; on<br>the horizon of classical physics<br>
In 1900 physicists pictured the atom as a nucleus that looked<br>
something like a plum to which were attached tiny protruding<br>springs (This was before the planetary model of the atom) At<br>the end of each spring was an electron Giving the atom a jolt,<br>by heating it, for instance, caused its electrons to Jiggle (oscil-<br>late) on the ends of their springs The jiggling electrons were<br>thought to give off radiant energy, and this was thought to<br>account for the fact that hot objects glow (An accelerating<br>
electrical charge creates electromagnetic radiation) (An electron<br>carries an electrical charge (negative) and if it is jiggling, it is<br>accelerating—first in one dnection and then in the other)<br>
Physicists thought that heating the atoms in a metal caused<br>
them to become agitated, and this in turn caused their electrons<br>to Jiggle up and down and emit hghf in the process The<br>energv that the atom absorbed when it was jolted (heated),<br>the theory went, was radiated bv the jiggling electrons (You<br>can substitute &quot;atomic oscillators&quot; if your friends won't take<br>&quot;jiggling electrons&quot; senouslv)<br>
This same theory also claimed that the energv absorbed bv<br>
an atom was distributed equallv to its oscillators (electrons)<br>and that those electrons which oscillated (jiggled) at higher<br>frequencies (faster) radiated their energy most efficiently<br>
Unfortunatelv, this theory didn't work It ' proved&quot; some<br>
very incorrect things First, it 'proved&quot; that all heated objects<br>
emit more high-frequency light (blue, violet) than low-frequency<br>
light (red) In other words, even moderately hot objects, ac-<br>cording to this classical theory, emit an intense blue-white<br>color, just like objects which are white-hot but in lesser<br>amounts This is incorrect Moderately hot objects emit<br>primarily red light Second, the classical theory &quot;proved that<br>
highly heated objects radiate infinite amounts of high-frequency<br>light This is incorrect Highly heated objects emit a finite<br>amount of high-frequencv light<br>
Do not be concerned with high frequencies and low fre-<br>
quencies These terms will be explained shortly The point is<br>that Planck was exploring one of the last major problems of<br>classical physics its erroneous predictions concerning energy<br>radiation Physicists dubbed this problem &quot;The Ultra-Violet<br>
Catastrophe &quot; Although it sounds like a rock band, &quot;The Ultra-<br>

1900) the way the classical theory predicted<br>
The name of the phenomenon that Planck was studying is<br>
black-body radiation Black-body radiation is the radiation that<br>
comes from a nonreflecting, perfectly absorbing flat (nonglossy)<br>black body Since black is the absence of color (no light is<br>reflected or emitted), black bodies have no color unless we<br>heat them If a black body is glowing a certain color, we know<br>that it is because of the energy that we have added to it and<br>not because it reflects or emits that color spontaneously<br>
A black body does not always mean a solid body that is<br>
black Suppose that we have a metal box that is completely<br>sealed except for a small hole If we look inside what do we<br>
 Nothing because there is no light in there (A little light<br>
may come in through the hole, but not that much)<br>

then look through the hole What do we<br>

studied<br>
All the physicists in 1900 assumed that after the electrons of<br>
an excited atom began to jiggle, they radiated their energy<br>smoothly and continuously until they &quot;ran down and their<br>energy was dissipated Planck discoverfed that excited atomic<br>oscillators do not do this They emit and absorb energy only<br>in specific amounts' Instead of radiating energy smoothly and<br>continuously like a clock spring runs down, they radiate their<br>energy in spurts, dropping to a lower energy level after each<br>spurt until they stop oscillating altogether In short, Planck<br>
discovered that the changes of nature are &quot;explosive,&quot; not<br>
continuous and smooth *<br>
Planck was the first physicist to talk about energy packets&quot;<br>
and 'quantized oscillators &quot; He sensed that he had made a<br>major discovery, one which ranked with the discoveries of<br>Newton, and he was right The philosophy and paradigms of<br>physics never were to be the same although it took another<br>twenty-seven years for 'quantum mechanics to take form<br>

It is difficult today to understand how bold was Planck's<br>
theory of quanta Victor Guillemm, professor of physics at<br>
Harvard, put it this way<br>
[Planck] had to make a radical and seemingly absurd<br>
assumption, for according to classical laws, and common<br>sense as well, it had been presumed that an electronic<br>oscillator, once set in motion by a jolt, radiates its energy<br>smoothly and gradually while its oscillatory motion subsides<br>to rest Planck had to assume that the oscillator ejects its<br>radiation in sudden spurts, dropping to lesser amplitudes<br>of oscillation with each spurt He had to postulate that<br>the energy of motion of each oscillator can neither build<br>up nor subside smoothly and gradually but may change<br>only in sudden jumps In a situation where energy is<br>being transferred to and fro between the oscillators and<br>the light waves, the oscillators must not only<i> emit</i> but<br>also<i> absorb</i> radiant energy in discrete 'packets He<br>
coined the name ' quanta for the packets of energy, and<br>
he spoke of the oscillators as being quantized ' Thus,<br>the trenchant concept of the<i> quantum</i> entered physical<br>
Planck is not only the father of quantum mechanics, he also<br>
is the discoverer of Planck's constant Planck s constant is a<br>certain number which never changes * It is used to calculate<br>the size of the energy packets (quanta) of each light frequency<br>(color) (The energv in each light quantum of a particular color<br>is the frequency of the light multiplied by Planck s constant)<br>
All of the energy packets of each color have the same amount<br>
of energy All of the energy packets of red light, for example,<br>are the same si/e All of the energy packets of green light are<br>the same si/e All of the energy packets of violet light are the<br>same size The energy packets of violet light, however, are<br>larger than the<br>
 packets of green light, and the energy<br>
packets of green light are larger than the energy packets of<br>red light<br>
In other words, Planck discovered that energy is absorbed<br>
and emitted in little chunks and that the size of the chunks of<br>a low-frequency light like red, is smaller than the sue of the<br>

chunks of a high-frequency light, like violet This explains<br>why hot objects radiate energy as they do<br>
When a black body is put over low heat, the first color it<br>
glows is red because the energy packets of red light are the<br>smallest energy packets in the visible light spectrum As the<br>heat is increased, more energy is available to shake loose<br>bigger energy packets The bigger energy packets make the<br>higher-frequency colors, such as blue and violet<br>
Why does the glow of hot metal seem to increase steadily<br>
in brightness as the temperature<br>
 Because the tiny<br>
&quot;steps&quot; upward and downward in brightness are so incredibly<br>small that our eyes cannot discern them Therefore, on the<br>large scale, or macroscopic level, this aspect of nature is not<br>evident In the subatomic realm, however, it is the dominant<br>
characteristic of nature<br>
If this discussion of emission and absorption of energy pack-<br>
ets reminds you of Niels Bohr (page 12), vou are right How-<br>ever, Bohr was not to arrive at his theory of specific electron<br>orbits for another thirteen years By that time physicists had<br>discarded the plum-with-jigglmg-electrons model of the atom<br>in favor of the planetary model, in which electrons revolve<br>around a nucleus *<br>
Between Planck s discovery of the quantum (1900) and Bohr s<br>
analysis of the hydrogen spectrum (1913), a brilliant physicist<br>burst upon the scene with a force seldom exerted by an indi-<br>vidual His name was Albert Einstein In one vear (1905), at<br>twenty-six, Einstein published five significant papers Three<br>of them were pivotal in the development of physics, and, to a<br>large extent, in the development of the West The first of<br>these three papers described the quantum nature of light It<br>
won him a Nobel Prize in 1921 The second paper described<br>molecular motion The third paper set forth the special theory<br>of relativity, which we will study later t<br>

Einstein's theory of light was that it is composed of tiny<br>
particles A beam of light, said Einstein, is analogous to a<br>
 of bullets Each bullet is called a photon This is similar<br>
to what Planck proposed but actually it is a leap<br>Planck discovered that energy is absorbed and emitted in<br>
packets He described the<i> processes</i> of energy absorbtion and<br>
j emission Einstein theorized that<br>
<i> itself</i> is<br>
To prove his theory, Einstein referred to a phenomenon<br>
I called the photoelectric effect When light hits (impinges on)<br>
 the surface of a metal, it jars electrons loose from the atoms in<br>
the metal and sends them flying off With appropriate equip-<br>ment, we can count these electrons and measure how fast<br>they are traveling<br>
Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect was that each<br>
time one of the bullets, or photons, hits an electron, it knocks<br>it away just as one billiard ball hitting another billiard ball<br>knocks it away<br>
Einstein based his revolutionary theory on the experimental<br>
work of Philippe Lenard (who won the Nobel Prize in 1905)<br>Lenard showed that the flow of electrons in the photoelectric<br>effect begins immediately when the impinging light strikes<br>the target metal Turn on the light and out come the electrons<br>
According 10 the wave theory of light, the electrons in a metal<br>only start to jiggle when they are struck by light waves They<br>do not come out of the metal until they are moving fast enough<br>This takes several oscillations, like pumping a child's swing<br>higher and higher until it goes around the bar In short, the<br>wave theory of light predicts a delayed emission of electrons<br>Lenard s experiments showed a prompt emission of electrons<br>
This prompt emission of electrons in the photoelectric effect<br>
is explained by Einstein's particle theory of light Every time<br>
a particle of light, a photon, strikes an electron, it immedi-<br>ately knocks it out of its atom<br>
Lenard also discovered that reducing the intensity of the<br>
impinging light beam (making it dimmer) did not reduce the<br>velocity of the rebounding electrons, but it did reduce the<br>number of the rebounding electrons He found that the velocity<br>
packets like those of blue and violet<br>
 Therefore over low heat metal<br>
glows led and over high heat it glows blue white<br>t Each of Einstein s major 1905 papers dealt with a fundamental physical con<br>stant h Planck s constant (the photon hvpothtsis) k Boltzmann s constant (the<br>analysis of Brownian<br>
 and c the velocity of light (the special theory<br>
of relativ ity)<br>

54 / PATTERNS OF ORGANIC ENERGY<br>
of the rebounding electrons could be altered, however, by<br>changing the<i> color</i> of the impinging light.<br>
This also was explained by Einstein's new theory. Accord-<br>
ing to Einstein's theory, each photon of a given color, like<br>green, for instance, has a certain amount of energy. Reducing<br>the intensity of a beam of green light only reduces the num-<br>ber of photons in the beam. Each remaining photon, howev-<br>
er, still has the same amount of energy as any other photon of<br>green light. Therefore, when any photon of green light strikes<br>an electron, it knocks it away with a certain amount of energy<br>which is characteristic of green-light photons.<br>
Max Planck described Einstein's theory this way:<br>
. . . The photons (the &quot;drops of energy) do not grow<br>
smaller as the energy of the ray grows less; what happens<br>is that their magnitude remains unchanged and they follow<br>each other at greater intervals.2<br>
Einstein's theory also substantiated Planck's revolutionary<br>
discovery. High-frequency light, like violet, is made of<br>
higher-energy photons than low-frequency light, like red.<br>Therefore, when violet light, which is made of high-energy<br>photons, strikes an electron, it causes the electron to rebound<br>with a high velocity. When red light, which is made of low-<br>energy photons, strikes an electron, it causes the electron to<br>rebound at a low velocity. In either case, increasing or de-<br>creasing the intensity of the light increases or decreases the<br>number of rebounding electrons, but only by changing the<br>color of the impinging light can we change their velocity.<br>
In short, Einstein demonstrated, using the photoelectric<br>
effect, that light is made of particles, or photons, and that the<br>photons of high-frequency light have more energy than the<br>photons of low-frequency light. This was a momentous achieve-<br>ment. The only problem<br>
 that one hundred and two years<br>
earlier an Englishman named Thomas Young had shown that<br>light is made of waves, and no one, including Einstein, was<br>able to disprove him.<br>
Now we come to the matter (no pun) of waves. A particle is<br>
something that is contained in one place. A wave is something<br>that is spread out. On the next page are some types of waves.<br>

We are concerned only with the last type of wave. Here is a<br>more detailed picture of it.<br>
A<br>
——————— WAVE<br>
 —————————frj<br>
DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT<br>
A<i> wavelength is</i> the distance between one crest of a wave<br>
and the next. The longest radio waves are over six miles long.<br>X-rays, on the other hand, are only about one billionth of a<br>centimeter long. Visible light has wavelengths in the neigh-<br>borhood of four to eight one hundred thousandths of a centi-<br>meter.<br>
The<i> amplitude</i> of a wave is the height of the wave crest<br>
above the dotted line. Here are three waves with different<br>amplitudes. The one in the middle has the largest amplitude.<br>
<hr>
<A name=76></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-76_1.png"><br>
56 / PATTERNS OF ORGANIC ENERGY<br>
The<i> frequency</i> of the wave tells us how many crests pass a<br>
given point (like Point A in the drawing) each second. If<br>the wave is moving in the direction of the arrow and a crest<br>
passes point A each second, the frequency of the wave is<br>one cycle per second. If ten and one half crests pass point<br>A every second, the frequency of the wave is 10.5 cycles<br>per second. If ten thousand crests pass the same point every<br>second, the frequency of the wave is 10,000 cycles per second,<br>and so on.<br>
The velocity of the wave can be determined by multiplying<br>
the wavelength by the frequency. For example, if the wave-<br>length of a wave is two feet and the frequency of the wave is<br>
one cycle per second, the wave is moving one wavelength<br>(two feet) every second. Therefore, its velocity is two feet per<br>second. If the wavelength is two feet and the frequency is<br>three cycles per second, the velocity of the wave is six feet<br>per second because the wave moves three wavelengths for-<br>ward every second.<br>
There is nothing complicated about this. We can determine<br>
how fast a man is running if we know the length of his stride<br>
and how many of them he takes in a second. By multiplying<br>them together we get how far the man runs in a second. If his<br>
stride is three feet and he takes two strides per second, then<br>
he runs six feet per second (about four miles per hour). We do<br>the same things with waves, except that we use wavelengths<br>instead of strides.<br>
Although the velocity of a light wave<i> can</i> be determined by<br>
multiplying its wavelength by its frequency, it is not neces-<br>
sary. Physicists have discovered that the velocity of light in<br>empty space is<i> always</i> 186,000 miles per second. This applies<br>to all electromagnetic waves, including light. Therefore, all<br>light waves (blue ones, green ones, red ones, etc.) have the<br>same velocity as radio waves, x-rays, and all the other forms of<br>electromagnetic radiation. The speed of light is a constant. It<br>is represented by the letter &quot;c.&quot;<br>
The constant &quot;c&quot; is (approximately) 186,000 miles per second<br>
and it never varies (which is what makes it a &quot;constant&quot;). It<br>does not matter whether light is going up or down, has a high<br>frequency or a low frequency, a large wavelength or a small<br>wavelength, is coming toward us or going away from us: Its<br>velocity is always 186,000 miles per second. This fact led<br>
Albert Einstein to the theory of special relativity, as we shall<br>see later.<br>
<hr>
<A name=77></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-77_1.png"><br>
<b>LIVING? / 57</b><br>
It also permits us to know both the frequency and the<br>
wavelength of light if we know either one of them. This is<br>because the product of the two is always 186,000 miles per<br>
second in empty space. The larger one of them is, the smaller<br>the other must be. For example, if we know that by multiply-<br>
ing two numbers together we get 12 for an answer, and if we<br>know that one of the numbers is 6, then we also know that the<br>other number<i> must</i> be 2. If we know that one of the numbers<br>is 3, then we know that the other number<i> must</i> be 4.<br>
Similarly, the higher the frequency of a light wave, the<br>
shorter its wavelength must be; the lower the frequency of a<br>light wave, the longer its wavelength must be. In other words,<br>
high-frequency light has a short wavelength and low-frequency<br>light has a long wavelength.<br>
Now we return to Planck's discovery. Planck discovered<br>
that the energy of a light quantum increases with frequency.<br>The higher the frequency, the higher the energy. Energy is<br>proportional to frequency, and Planck's constant is the &quot;con-<br>stant of proportionality&quot; between them. This simple relation<br>between frequency and energy is important. It is central to<br>quantum mechanics. The higher the frequency, the higher<br>the energy; the lower the frequency, the lower the energy.<br>
When we put wave mechanics and Planck's discovery to-<br>
gether we get this: High-frequency light, such as violet light,<br>has a short wavelength and high energy; low-frequency light,<br>such as red light, has a long wavelength and low energy.<br>
This explains the photoelectric effect. Photons of violet light<br>
knock electrons loose from the atoms of a metal and send<br>them flying away at a higher velocity than photons of red light<br>
because the photons of violet light, which is a high-frequency<br>light, have more energy than the photons of red light, which<br>is a low-frequency light.<br>
This all makes sense if you overlook the fact that we are<br>
talking about particles (photons) in terms of waves (frequen-<br>cies) and waves in terms of particles, which, of course, makes<br>no sense at all.<br>
If you feel that you understand the last few pages, congratu-<br>
lations! You have mastered the most difficult mathematics in<br>the book. If not, go back to page 54 and reread these pages. It<br>is easy to dance with wavelengths and frequencies if you know<br>how they are connected.<br>

own. For example, under certain conditions they bend around<br>corners. When this happens it is called diffraction.<br>
Imagine that we are in a helicopter hovering over the mouth<br>
of an artificial harbor. The mouth of the harbor is wide enough<br>for two aircraft carriers to pass each other going through it.<br>
The sea is rough and the wind and waves are blowing straight<br>
into the mouth of the harbor. When we look down, this is the<br>
pattern that we see the waves making in the harbor:<br>
The waves are stopped cleanly by the walls of the harbor<br>except at the harbor entrance, where they continue straight<br>forward into the harbor until they are dissipated.<br>
Now imagine that the mouth of the harbor is so small that a<br>
rowboat scarcely can pass through it. As we look down from<br>the helicopter, the pattern we see is quite different.<br>
<hr>
<A name=79></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-79_1.png"><br>
LIVING? / 59<br>
Instead of moving directly ahead into the harbor, the waves<br>inside the harbor are spreading out from the mouth of the<br>harbor almost as if it were a pond and we had dropped a rock<br>into it at that point. This is diffraction.<br>
Why does it happen? Why does reducing the size of the<br>
harbor mouth cause the wave pattern inside the harbor to<br>spread out in semicircles?<br>
The answer lies in comparing the size of the harbor mouth<br>
to the size of the wavelength of the incoming waves. In the<br>first case, the size of the harbor mouth is considerably larger<br>than the distance between the crests of the waves going through<br>it, and the waves proceed directly through it into the harbor<br>
following a straight line (rectilinear propagation) as waves usually<br>do.<br>
In the second case, the size of the harbor mouth is about<br>
the same size, or smaller, than the wavelength of the incom-<br>ing waves, and when this happens, it causes the characteristic<br>pattern (diffraction) that we see in the drawing.<br>
Whenever waves pass through an opening that is so small<br>
that the wavelength of the waves passing through it seems<br>large in comparison, the waves passing through it diffract.<br>
Since light is a wave phenomenon (according to the wave<br>
theory of light), it should behave in the same way, and it<br>
does. If we place a light source behind a cut-out like the one<br>below, it casts a projection on the wall like this one:<br>
This is analogous to sea waves entering the large harbor<br>
mouth. The width of the cut-out is millions of times larger<br>than the wavelength of the light. As a result, the light waves<br>go straight through it, following straight lines and projecting<br>
onto the wall a figure with the same shape as the cut-out.<br>
Notice especially that this projection has distinct borders be-<br>tween the bright area and the dark area.<br>

<IMG src="dancingmasters-80_3.png"><br>
60 / PATTERNS OF ORGANIC ENERGY<br>
If we make the cut-out no larger than a razor slit so that its<br>
width is roughly as small as the wavelength of the<br>light, the light diffracts Now the sharp boundary between the<br>light area and the dark area disappears and we see a bright<br>area that fades into darkness at the edges Instead of proceeding<br>in a straight line to the wall, the light beam has spread out<br>like a fan This is diffracted light<br>
Now that you know the punch line, here comes the storv<br>
In 1803, Thomas Young settled once and for all (he thought)<br>
the question of the nature of light He used an experiment that<br>was both simple and dramatic In front of a light source (Young<br>used sunlight coming through a hole in a screen) he placed a<br>screen with two vertical slits in it Each slit could be covered<br>
over with a piece of material<br>

On the other side of the double-slit screen was a wall against<br>which the light coming through the double slits could shine<br>When the light source was turned on and one of the slits was<br>covered up the wall was illuminated like the first drawing on<br>the next page<br>
When both slits were uncovered however, Young made<br>
historv The projection on the wall should have been the sum<br>of the light from the two slits, but it wasn't Instead, the wall<br>

How could this<br>
The simplicity of the answer is what makes this experiment<br>
a great one The alternating light and dark bands are a well-<br>known phenomenon of wave mechanics called interference<br>Interference results when the waves of light diffracting from<br>the two slits interfere with each other In some places these<br>

waves overlap and reinforce one another In othei places they<br>cancel each other<br>
In areas where one wave crest overlaps another wave crest,<br>
the result is an intensification of light (the light bands) In<br>areas where a crest meets a trough, they cancel each other<br>and no light reaches the wall (the dark bands)<br>
It is just as if we dropped two stones into a pond simulta-<br>
neouslv and watched the waves spreading from their points of<br>entry The waves that the stones make interfere with each<br>
other In places where the crests of the waves caused by one<br>stone meet the crests of the waves caused<i> by</i> the other stone,<br>large waves result In places where the troughs of the waves<br>caused by one stone meet the crests of the waves caused by<br>the other stone, the water is calm<br>
In short Young's double-slit experiment showed that light<br>
must be wave-like because only waves can create interference<br>
patterns The situation, then, was as follows Einstein, using<br>the photoelectric effect, &quot;proved&quot; that light is particle-like<br>and Young, using the phenomenon of interference, &quot;proved&quot;<br>that light is wave-like But a wave cannot be a particle and a<br>particle cannot be a wave<br>
That is just the beginning' Since Einstein &quot;proved&quot; that light<br>
is composed of<br>
 let us go back to Young's double-slit<br>
experiment and run it with photons * (This has been done)<br>
Suppose that we have a light gun which can fire, in effect, one<br>
photon at a tune The experiment is set up as before, except<br>that only one slit is open Now we fire the photon, it goes<br>through the open slit, and we mark where it hits the wall<br>'using a photographic plate)<br>
 we have done this<br>
experiment before, \ve notice that the photon has landed in<br>an area that would be dark if the second slit were open That<br>is, if the second slit were open, no photons would be recorded<br>in this area<br>
To make siue, we do the experiment again, but this time<br>
we leave both of the slits open Just as we thought, there ire<br>no photons recorded now in the area where the photon hit in<br>oui fust experiment When both slits are open and interfer-<br>ence is present, this area is in the middle of a dark band<br>

both slits are open, there are<i> always</i> alternating hands of<br>illuminated and dark areas This means that there are always<br>areas where the photons never go (otherwise theie would not<br>be any dark areas) If one of the slits is closed, there is no<br>interference and the dark bands disappeai, the whole wall<br>becomes illuminated, including those areas which previously<br>were dark when both slits were open<br>

how did it &quot;know&quot; that it could go to an area that must be<br>dark if the other slit were<br>
 In other words, how did the<br>
photon know that the other slit was closed<br>
&quot;The central<br>
 of quantum theory, wrote Henry<br>
Stapp, is 'How does information get around so<br>
 &quot;<br>
How does the particle know that there are two<br>
 How<br>
does the information about what is happening<br>
 where<br>
else get collected to determine what is likely to happen<br>here?3<br>
There is no definitive answer to this question Some physi-<br>
cists, like E H Walker, speculate that photons may be<i> con-<br>scious1</i><br>
Consciousness may be associated \vith all quantum me-<br>chanical processes since everything that occurs is<br>ultimately the result of one or more quantum mechanical<br>events, the universe is &quot;inhabited ' by an almost unlimited<br>number of rather discrete conscious, usually nonthinking<br>entities that are responsible for the detailed working of<br>
Whether Walker is correct or not, it appears that if there<br>
really are photons (and the photoeleeti ic effect &quot;proves&quot; that<br>there are), then it also appears that the photons in the double-<br>slit experiment somehow &quot;know&quot; whether or not both slits are<br>open and that they act accordingly *<br>
This brings us back to where we started Something is or-<br>
ganic&quot; if it has the abihtv to process information and to act<br>
 We have little choice but to acknowledge that<br>
photons, which are<br>
 do appear to process information<br>
and to act accordingly, and that therefore, strange as it inav<br>

sound they seem to be organic Since we are also organic,<br>there is a<br>
 that by studying photons (and other energy<br>
quanta) we mav learn something about us<br>
The wave-particle duality was the end of the line for classi-<br>
cal<br>
 According to that way of thinking, if we know<br>
certain initial conditions, we can predict the future of events<br>because we know the laws that govern them In double-slit<br>experiments we know all that we can know about initial condi-<br>tions and we still can t predict correctl) what happens to single<br>photons<br>
In experiment one, for example (only one slit open) we<br>
know the origin of the photon (the lamp) its velocity (186 000<br>miles per second) and its direction just prior to passing through<br>the open slit Using Newton s laws of motion we can predict<br>where the photon will land on the photographic plate Let us<br>suppose that we make these calculations<br>
Now let us consider experiment two (both slits open) Again<br>
we know the origin of the photon its velocity and its direc-<br>tion just prior to passing through the open slit The initial<br>conditions of the photon in experiment one are the same as<br>thost of the photon in experiment two They both start from<br>the same place, travel at the same speed, go to the same<br>plaee and therefore are moving in the same direction just<br>prior to passing through slit number one The onlv difference<br>is that in the second experiment the second slit also is open<br>Again using Newton s laws of motion, let us calculate where<br>the photon will land on the photographic plate<br>
Since we used the same iigures and the same formulas in<br>
both eases, we get identical answers indicating that the photon<br>in experiment one will impact in exactly the same place as the<br>photon in experiment two That is the problem The photon<br>in experiment two will<i> not</i> impact in the same area as the<br>
photon in experiment one because the photon in experiment<br>one landed in an area that is a dark band in experiment two<br>
In other words the two photons do not go to the same place<br>
even though the initial conditions pertaining to both of them<br>are identical and known to us<br>
We cannot determine the paths of individual photons We<br>
can determine what the wave pattern on the wall will be, but<br>in this case we are interested in a single photon, not waves of<br>them In other words, we know the pattern that large groups<br>of photons will make, and their distribution in the pattern,<br>

but we have no way of knowing which photons will go where<br>All that we can say about a single photon is the probability of<br>finding it in a given plate<br>
The wave-particle duality was (is) one of the thorniest prob-<br>
lems in quantum mechanics Physicists like to have tidy theories<br>which explain<br>
 and if they are not able to do that,<br>
thev like to have tidy theories about why thev can't The<br>wave-particle duality is not a tidy situation In fact, its untidi-<br>ness has forced physicists into radical new ways of perceiv ing<br>
 reality These new perceptual frames are consider-<br>
 more compatible with the nature of personal experience<br>
than were the old<br>
For most of us, life is seldom black and white The wave-<br>
particle duality marked the end of the &quot;Either-Or&quot; way of looking<br>at the world Physicists no longer could accept the pioposition<br>that light is<i> either</i> a particle<i> or</i> a wave because they had<br>&quot;proved to themselves that it was<i> both,</i> depending on how<br>thev looked at it<br>
Of course, Einstein was aware of the fact that his photon<br>
theorv contradicted Young s wave theory without disproving<br>it He speculated that photons were guided bv ghost waves &quot;<br>Ghost waves were mathematical entities which had no actual<br>existence The photons seemed to follow paths which had all<br>the mathematical characteristics of waves, but which in reality<br>
did not exist Some physicists still view the wave-particle par-<br>adox this way, but for most physicists, this explanation seems<br>too contrived It is an answer which appears to make sense,<br>but somehow doesn t explain anything<br>
The wave-particle duality prompted the first real step in<br>
understanding the newly unfolding quantum theory In 1924,<br>Bohr and two of his colleagues, H A Kramers and John<br>Slater, suggested that the waves in question were<i> probability</i><br>
 Probability waves were mathematical entities<i> by</i> which<br>
physicists could predict the probability of certain e\ ents oc-<br>curring or not occurring Their mathematics did not prove<br>correct but their idea, which was unlike anything that had<br>been proposed before, was sound Later, with a different<br>formalism (mathematical structure), the idea of probability waves<br>developed into one of the distinguishing characteristics of<br>quantum mechanics<br>
Probability waves, as Bohi, Kramers, and Slater thought of<br>
them, was an<br>
 new idea Probability itself was not<br>
new, but this type of<br>
 was It referred to what<br>
<hr>

66 / PATTERNS OF ORGANIC ENERGY<br>
somehow already was happening, but had not yet been<br>actualized. It referred to a<i> tendency</i> to happen, a tendency<br>that in an undefined way existed of itself, even if it never<br>
became an event. Probability waves were mathematical cata-<br>logues of these tendencies.<br>
This was something quite different from classical probability.<br>
If we throw a die in a casino, we know, using classical<br>
 that the chances of getting the number that we<br>
want is one in six. The probability wave of Bohr, Kramers,<br>and Slater meant much more than that.<br>
According to Heisenberg:<br>
It meant a tendency for something. It was a quantitative<br>version of the old concept of &quot;potentia&quot; in Aristotelian<br>
philosophy. It introduced something standing in the mid-<br>dle between the idea of an event and the actual event, a<br>strange kind of physical reality just in the middle be-<br>tween possibility and reality.5<br>
By 1924, Planck's discovery of the quantum was producing<br>
seismic effects in physics. It enabled Einstein to discover the<br>
photon, which caused the wave-particle duality, which led to<br>probability waves. The physics of Newton was a thing of the<br>past.<br>
Physicists found themselves dealing with energy that some-<br>
how processed information (which made it organic), and<br>unaccountably presented itself in patterns (waves). In short,<br>physicists found themselves dealing with Wu Li—patterns of<br>organic energy.<br>

CHAPTER<br>
1<br>
What Happens<br>
Quantum mechanics is a procedure. It is a specific way of<br>looking at a specific part of reality. The only people who use it<br>are physicists. The advantage of following the procedure of<br>quantum mechanics is that it allows us to predict the<i> proba-<br>bilities</i> of certain results provided our experiment is performed<br>in a certain way. The purpose of quantum mechanics is not to<br>
predict what actually will happen, but only to predict the<br>probabilities of various possible results. Physicists would like<br>to be able to predict subatomic events more accurately, but,<br>at present, quantum mechanics is the only workable theory of<br>subatomic phenomena that they have been able to construct.<br>
Probabilities follow deterministic laws in the same way that<br>
macroscopic events follow deterministic laws. There is a di-<br>rect parallel. If we know enough about the initial conditions of<br>
an experiment, we can calculate, using rigid laws of develop-<br>ment, exactly what the probability is for a certain result to<br>occur.<br>
For example, there is no way that we can calculate where a<br>
single photon in a double-slit experiment will strike the pho-<br>tographic plate (page 64). However, we can calculate with<br>precision the probability that it will strike it at a certain place,<br>provided that the experiment has been prepared properly and<br>that the results are measured properly.<br>
Suppose that we calculate a 60 percent probability for the<br>
photon to land in area A. Does that mean that it can land<br>somewhere else? Yes. In fact, there is a 40 percent probability<br>that it will.<br>

68 / PATTERNS OF ORGANIC ENERGY<br>
In that case (asking the question for Jim de Wit), what<br>
determines where the photon will<br>
 The answer given<br>
by quantum theory pure chance<br>
This pure-chance aspect was another<br>
 that Einstein<br>
had about quantum mechanics It is one of the reasons that<br>he never accepted it as the fundamental physical theory<br>
'Quantum mechanics is very impressive,&quot; he wrote in a letter<br>
to Max Born, &quot; but I am convinced that God does not play<br>dice<br>
Two generations later, J S Bell, a<br>
 physicist, proved<br>
that he may have been right, but that is another story, which<br>we will come to later<br>
The first step in the procedure of quantum mechanics is to<br>
prepare a physical system (the experimental apparatus) accord-<br>ing to certain specifications, in an area called the region of<br>preparation<br>
The second step in the procedure of quantum mechanics is<br>
to prepare another physical system to measure the results of<br>the experiment This measuring system is located in an area<br>
called the region of measurement Ideally, the region of meas-<br>
urement is far away from the region of preparation Of course,<br>
to a subatomic particle, even a small macroscopic distance is a<br>long way<br>
Now let us perform the double-slit experiment using this<br>
procedure First, we set a light source on a table, and then, a<br>short distance away, we place a screen with two vertical slits<br>in it The area where these apparatuses are located is the<br>region of preparation Next we fix an unexposed photographic<br>plate on the opposite side of the screen from the light source<br>
This area is the region of measurement<br>
The third step in the procedure of quantum mechanics is to<br>
translate what we know about the apparatus in the region of<br>preparation (the light and the screen) into mathematical terms<br>which represent it, and to do likewise for the apparatus that is<br>located in the region of measurement (the photographic plate)<br>
To do this we need to know the specifications of the appara-<br>
tus In practice, this means that we give the technician who<br>sets up the equipment precise instructions We tell him, for<br>example, the exact distance to place the double-slit screen<br>
from the light source, the frequency and intensity of the light<br>
that we will use, the dimensions of the two slits and their<br>position relative to each other and to the light source, etc We<br>
also give him equally explicit instructions concerning the meas-<br>
<hr>

WHAT HAPPENS / 69<br>
tiring apparatus, such as where to put it, the type of photo-<br>graphic film that we will use, how to develop it, etc<br>
After we translate these specifications of the experimental<br>
arrangement into the mathematical language of quantum theory,<br>we feed these mathematical quantities into an equation that<br>expresses the form of natural causal development Notice that<br>this last sentence doesn t sav anything about what is develop-<br>ing That is because nobod&gt; knows The Copenhagen Inter-<br>
pretation of Quantum Mechanics (page 37) says that quantum<br>theory is a complete theory because it works (correlates<br>experience) in everv possible experimental situation not be-<br>cause it explains in detail what is going on * (Einstein s com-<br>plaint was that quantum theorv doesn t fullv explain things<br>because it deals with group behavior and not with individual<br>events)<br>
However, when it comes to predicting group behavior,<br>
quantum theory works as advertised In a double-slit experi-<br>ment, for example it can predict exactly the probabilities of a<br>photon being recorded in region A, in region B, in region<br>C, and so forth<br>
Of course, the last step in the procedure of quantum me<br>
chanics is actually to do the experiment and get a result<br>
To apply quantum theory, the physical world must be divided<br>
into two parts These parts are the observed svstem and the<br>observing system The observed svstem and the observing<br>system are not the same as the region of preparation and the<br>region of measurement ' Region of preparation and &quot;region<br>of measurement' are terms which describe the physical or-<br>ganization of the experimental apparatus ' Observed system&quot;<br>and ' observing system' are terms which pertain to the way<br>
that physicists analyze the experiment (The 'observed ' svstem,<br>
by the way, cannot be observed until it interacts with the<br>observing system, and even then all that we can observe are<br>its effects on a measuring device)<br>
The observed system in the double-slit experiment is a<br>
photon It is pictured as traveling between the region of<br>preparation and the region of measurement The observing<br>svstem in all quantum mechanical experiments is the environ-<br>

ment which surrounds the observed system—including the<br>physicists who are<br>
 the experiment While the ob-<br>
served system is traveling undisturbed ( propagating in isola-<br>tion ), it develops according to a natural causal law This law<br>of causal development is called the Schrodmger wave equation<br>
The information that we put into the Schiodmger wave equation<br>is the data about the experimental apparatuses that we have<br>transcribed into the mathematical language of quantum theory<br>
Each set of these experimental specifications that we<br>
transcribed into the mathematical language of quantum theory<br>corresponds to what physicists call an observable Observ-<br>ables are the features of the experiment and nature that are<br>considered to be fixed or determined, when and if the<br>experimental specifications that we have transcribed actually<br>
are met We mav have transcribed into mathematical language<br>several experimental specifications for the region of measure-<br>ment each one corresponding to a different possible result<br>(the possibility that the photon will land in region A, the<br>possibility that the photon will land in legion B the possibility<br>that the photon will land in region<i> C</i> etc )<br>
In the world of mathematics the experimental specifications<br>
of each of these possible situations in the region of measure-<br>ment and in the region of preparation corresponds to an ob-<br>servable * In the world of experience an observable is the<br>possible occurrence (coming into our experience) of one of<br>these sets of specifications<br>
In other words, what happens to the observed<br>
between the region of preparation and the region of meas-<br>urement is expressed<br>
 as a<i> correlation</i> between<br>
two observables (production and detection) Yet we know that<br>the observed system is a particle—a photon Said another<br>

As Stapp wrote for the Atomic<br>

an elementary particle is not an independently existing,<br>
unanalyzable entity It is, in essence a set of relation-<br>ships that reach outward to other things 2<br>
Furthermore the mathematical picture which physicists have<br>
constructed of this set of relationships is verv similar to the<br>mathematical picture of a real (physical) moving particle<br>
motion of such a set of relationships is governed by exactly<br>the same equation which governs the motion of a real moving<br>

Wrote Stapp<br>
A long-range correlation between observables has the<br>interesting propertv that the equation of motion which<br>governs the propagation of this effect is precisely the<br>equation of motion of a freely moving particle 3<br>

Quantum mechanics is based on the development in isola-<br>
tion of an observed system &quot;Development in isolation ' refers<br>to the isolation that we create by separating the region of<br>preparation from the region of measurement We call this<br>situation 'isolation, but in reality, nothing<br>
 completely iso-<br>
lated, except, perhaps the universe as a whole (What would<br>it be isolated<br>
The &quot;isolation&quot; that we create is an idealization, and one<br>
point of view is that quantum mechanics allows us to idealize<br>a photon from the fundamental unbroken umtv so that we can<br>study it In fact, a photon&quot; seems to become isolated from the<br>fundamental<br>
 umtv<br>
 we are<br>
 it<br>
Photons do not exist by themselves All that exists bv itself<br>
is an unbroken wholeness that presents itself to us as webs<br>(more patterns) of relations Individual entities are idealiza-<br>tions which are correlations made b&gt; us<br>
In short, the physical world, according to quantum mechan-<br>
ics, is<br>
not a structure built out oi independently existing<br>
unanalyzable entities, but lather a web of relationships<br>between elements whose meanings arise wholly from<br>their relationships to the whole (Stapp)4<br>
The new physics sounds very much like old eastern mysti-<br>
cism<br>
What happens between the region of preparation and the<br>
region of measurement is a dynamic (changing with time)<br>
unfolding of possibilities that occurs according to the Schrod-<br>mger wave equation We can determine for anv moment in<br>the development of these possibilities, the probability of any<br>
one of them occurring<br>
One possibility mav be that the photon will land in region<br>
A Another possibility mav be that the photon will land in<br>region B However it is not possible for the same photon to<br>land in region A and in region B at the same time When one<br>of these possibilities is actualized, the probability that the other<br>one will occur at the same time becomes zero<br>

making a measurement interferes with the development in<br>isolation of the<br>
 system When we interfere with the<br>
development in isolation of the observed system (which is<br>what Schrodmger's wave equation governs) we<br>
 one<br>
of the several potentialities that were a part of the observed<br>system while it was in isolation For example, as soon as we<br>detect the photon in region A, the possibility that it is in<br>region B, or anyplace else, becomes nihil<br>
The development of possibilities that takes place between<br>
the region of preparation and the region of measurement is<br>represented by a particular kind of mathematical entity Phys-<br>icists call this mathematical entity a wave function because<br>it looks, mathematically, like a development of waves which<br>constantly change and proliferate In a nutshell, the Schrodmger<br>wave equation governs the development in isolation (between<br>the region of preparation and the region of measurement) of<br>
the observed system (a photon in this case) which is represented<br>
mathematically by a wave function<br>
A wave function is a mathematical fiction that represents all<br>
the possibilities that can happen to an observed system when<br>it interacts with an observing system ( a measuring device)<br>
The form of the wave function of an observed system can be<br>calculated via the Schrodmger wave equation for any moment<br>between the time the observed system leaves the region of<br>preparation and the time that it interacts with the observing<br>
svstem<br>
Once the wave function is calculated, we can perform a<br>
simple mathematical operation on it (square its amplitude) to<br>create a second mathematical entity called a probability function<br>(or, technically, a' probability density function ') The probability<br>function tells us the probabilities at a given time(s) of each of<br>the possibilities represented by the wave function The wave<br>func tion is calculated with the Schrodmger wave equation It<br>
deals with possibilities The probability function is based upon<br>the wave function It deals with probabilities<br>
There is a difference between possible and probable Some<br>
things may be possible, but not very probable like snow<br>falling in the summer, except in Antarctica where it is both<br>possible and probable<br>
The wave function of an observed system is a mathematical<br>
catalogue which gives a physical description of those things<br>which could happen to the observed system when we make a<br>

 and the probability of that possibility becomes<br>
<i>one</i> which means that it happens<br>
The development of the wave function (possibilities) follows<br>
an unvarying determinism We calculate this development bv<br>using the Schrodmger wave equation Since the probability<br>function is based upon the wave function, the probabilities of<br>possible happenings also develop determmistically via the<br>Schrodmger wave equation<br>
This is why we can predict accurately the probability of an<br>
event but not the event itself We can calculate the probability<br>of a desired result, but when we make a measurement, that<br>result mav or may not be the one that we get The photon<br>may land in region B or it may land in region A Which<br>
possibility becomes reality is, according to quantum theory a<br>matter of chance<br>
Now back to the double-slit experiment We cannot predict<br>
where a photon in a double-slit experiment will land Howev-<br>er, we can calculate where it is most likely to land, where it is<br>next likely to land and so on * This is how it happens<br>
Suppose that we place a photon detector at slit one and<br>
another photon detector at slit two Now we emit photons<br>from the light source Sooner or later one of them will go<br>through one slit or the other There are two possibilities for<br>that photon It can go through slit one and detector one will<br>fire, or it can go through slit two and detector two will fire<br>Each of these possibilities is included in the wave function of<br>that photon<br>
Let us say that when we examine the detectors we find that<br>
detector two has fired As soon as we know this we also know<br>that the photon did not go through slit one That possibility<br>

no longer exists, and therefore, the wave function of the<br>photon has changed<br>
The graphic representation (picture) of the wave function of<br>
the photon before we made the measurement had two humps<br>in it One of the humps represented the possibility of the<br>photon passing through slit one and detector one firing The<br>
other hump represented the possibility of the photon passing<br>through slit two and detector two firing<br>
When the photon was detected passing through slit two,<br>
the possibility that it would go through slit one ceased to<br>exist When that happened, the hump in the graphic repre-<br>sentation of the wave function representing that possibility<br>
changed to a straight line This phenomenon is called the<br>' collapse of the wave function<br>
Physicists speak as if the wave function exhibits two very<br>
different modes of development The first is a smooth and<br>dynamic development which we can predict because it follows<br>the Schrodmger wave equation The second is abrupt and<br>discontinuous (that word, again) This mode of development is<br>the collapse of the wave function Which part of the wave<br>function collapses is a matter of chance The transition from<br>the first mode to the second mode is called a quantum jump<br>
The Quantum Jump is not a dance It is the abrupt collapse<br>
of all the developing aspects of the wave function except the<br>one that actualizes The mathematical representation of the<br>observed system literally leaps from one situation to another,<br>with no apparent development between the two<br>
In a quantum mechanical experiment, the observed svstem,<br>
traveling undisturbed between the region of preparation and<br>the region of measurement, develops according to the Schrod-<br>mger wave equation During this time, all of the allowed<br>things that could happen to it unfold as a de\ eloping wave<br>
function However, as soon as it interacts with a measuring<br>device (the observing system), one of those possibilities<br>actualizes and the rest cease to exist The quantum leap is<br>from a multifaceted potentiality to a single actuality<br>
The quantum leap is also a leap from a reality with a<br>
theoretically infinite number of dimensions into a reahtv which<br>has only three This is because the wave function of the ob-<br>served system, before it is observed, proliferates in many<br>mathematical dimensions<br>
Take the wave function of our photon in the double-slit<br>
experiment for example It contains two possibilities The first<br>

possibility is that the photon will go through slit one and<br>detector one will fire, and the second possibility is that the<br>photon will go through slit two and detector two will fire<br>Each of these possibilities, alone, would be represented by a<br>
wave function that exists in three dimensions and a time This<br>is because our reality has three dimensions, length, width,<br>and depth, along with time<br>
If we want to describe a physical event accurately, we must<br>
say where it happened and when<br>
To describe where something happens requires three &quot;coor-<br>
dinates &quot; Suppose that I want to give directions to an invisible<br>balloon floating in an emptv room I could say, for example,<br>' Starting in a certain corner, go five feet along a certain wall<br>(one dimension), four feet directly out from the wall (second<br>dimension), and three feet up from the floor (third dimen-<br>sion) &quot; Every possibility exists in three dimensions and has a<br>time<br>
If the wave function represents possibilities associated with<br>
two different particles, then that wave function exists in six<br>
dimensions, three for each particle If the wave function repre-<br>
 the possibilities associated with twelve particles, then<br>
that wave function exists in thirty-six dimensions'*<br>
This is impossible to visualize since our experience is lim-<br>
ited to three dimensions Nontheless, this is the mathematics<br>of the situation<br>
The point to think about is that when we make a measure-<br>
ment in a quantum mechanical experiment—when the ob-<br>served system interacts with the observing system—we reduce<br>a multi-dimensional reality to a three-dimensional reality com-<br>patible with our experience<br>
If we calculate a wave function for possible photon detec-<br>
tion at four different points, that wave function is a mathemat-<br>ical reality in which four different happenings exist simulta-<br>neously in twelve dimensions In principle, we can calculate a<br>wave function representing an infinite number of events<br>happening at the same time in an infinite number of dimen-<br>sions No matter how complex the wave function, however, as<br>

soon as we make a measurement, we reduce it to a form<br>compatible with three dimensional reality, which is the only<br>form of experiential reality, instant by instant, normally avail-<br>able to us<br>
Now we come to the question, &quot;When, exactly, does the<br>
wave function<br>
 When do all of the possibilities that<br>
are developing for the observed system except one,<br>
Up to now, we have said that the collapse occurs when<br>
somebody looks at the observed system This is only one<br>point of view Another opinion (anv discussion about this ques-<br>tion is opinion) is that the wave function collapses when / look<br>at the observed system Still another opinion is that the wave<br>
function collapses when any measurement is made, even by<br>an instrument According to this view, it is not important<br>whether we are there to see it or not<br>
Suppose for the moment that there are no human experi-<br>
menters involved in our experiment It is entirely automatic<br>
A light source emits a photon The wave function of the photon<br>contains the possibility that the photon will pass through slit<br>one and detector one will fire, and also the possibihtv that the<br>photon will pass through slit two and detector two will fire<br>
Now suppose that detector two registers a photon<br>According to classical physics the light source emitted a real<br>
particle, a photon, and it trav eled from the light source to the<br>slit where detector two recorded it Although we did not<br>know its location while it was in transit, we could have de-<br>termined it, if we had known how<br>
According to quantum mechanics, this is not so No real<br>
particle called a photon traveled between the light source and<br>the screen There was no photon until one actualized at slit<br>two Until then, there was only a wave function In other<br>words, until then, all that existed were tendencies for a photon<br>to actualize either at slit one or at slit two<br>
From the classical point of view, a real photon travels be-<br>
tween the light source and the screen The odds are 50-50 that it<br>will go to slit one and 50-50 that it will go to slit two From the<br>point of view of quantum mechanics, there is no photon until<br>a detector fires There is only a developing potentiality in<br>
which a photon goes to slit one<i> and</i> to slit two This is<br>

from mathematics to English entails a loss of precision but<br>that is not the problem We can experience a more clearly<br>defined picture of this phenomenon by learning enough<br>mathematics to follow the development of the Schrodmger wave<br>equation Unfortunately, clarifying the picture only helps to<br>boggle the mind<br>
The real problem is that we are used to looking at the world<br>
simply We are accustomed to believing that something is<br>there or it is not there Whether we look at it or not, it is<br>
either there or it is not there Our experience tells us that the<br>physical world is solid, real, and independent of us Quantum<br>mechanics says, simply, that this is not so<br>
Suppose that a technician, not knowing that our experiment<br>
is automatic, enters the room to see which detector has recorded<br>a photon When he looks at the observing system (the detec-<br>tors), there are two things that he can see The first possibility<br>is that detector one has recorded the photon, and the second<br>possibility is that detector two has recorded the photon The<br>wave function of the observing system (which now is the<br>technician), therefore, has two humps in it, one for each<br>possibility<br>
Until the technician looks at the detectors, quantum me-<br>
chanically speaking, both situations in some way exist As<br>soon as he sees that detector two has fired, however, the<br>possibility that detector one has fired vanishes That part of<br>the wave function of the measuring system collapses, and the<br>reality of the technician is that detector two has recorded a<br>photon In other words, the observing system of the experi-<br>ment, the detectors, has become the observed system in relation<br>to the technician<br>
Now suppose that the supervising physicist enters the room<br>
to check on the technician He wants to see what the technician<br>has learned about the detectors In this regard, there are two<br>possibilities One is that the technician has seen that detector<br>one has recorded a photon, and the other is that the technician<br>has seen that detector two has recorded a photon, and so on *<br>

possibilities is the type of development governed by the<br>Schrodmger wave equation<br>

the wave function of the photon, the wave function of the<br>measuring system, technician, and supervisor similarly would<br>
have twenty-five separate humps, until a perception is made<br>and the wave function collapses From photon to detectors to<br>technician to supervisor we could continue until we include<br>the entire universe<i> Who is looking at the</i><br>

The answer comes full circle<i> We</i> are actualizing the universe<br>

This line of thought is similar to some aspects of Buddhist<br>
psychology In addition, it could become one of many impor-<br>tant contributions of physics to future models of consciousness<br>
The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics says<br>
that it is unnecessary to &quot;peer behind the scenes to see what<br>is really happening as long as quantum mechanics works<br>(correlates experience correctly) in all possible experimental<br>situations It is not necessary to know how light can manifest<br>itself both as particles and waves It is enough to know that it<br>does and to be able to use this phenomenon to predict<br>probabilities In other words, the wave and particle character-<br>istics of light are unified by quantum mechanics, but at a<br>
price There is no description of reality<br>

All attempts to describe &quot;reality&quot; are relegated to the realm<br>
of metaphysical speculation.* However, this does not mean<br>that physicists do not speculate. Many do, in particular Henry<br>Stapp, and their reasoning goes like this.<br>
The fundamental theoretical quantity in quantum mechan-<br>
ics is the wave function. The wave function is a dynamic (it<br>
changes as time progresses) description of possible occurrences.<br>
But what does the wave function describe, really? According<br>
to western thought, the world has only two essential aspects,<br>one of which is matter-like and the other of which is idea-like.<br>
The matter-like aspect is associated with the external world,<br>
most of which is conceived to be made of inanimate stuff that<br>is hard and unresponsive, like rocks, pavement, metal, etc.<br>The idea-like aspect is our subjective experience. Reconciling<br>these two has been a central theme of religion through histo-<br>ry. The philosophies which champion these aspects are Mate-<br>rialism (the world is matter-like, regardless of our impressions)<br>and Idealism (reality is idea-like, regardless of appearances).<br>
The question is, which one of these aspects does the wave<br>function represent?<br>
The answer, according to the orthodox view of quantum<br>
mechanics elucidated by Stapp, is that the wave function<br>represents something that partakes of<i> both</i> idea-like and<br>matter-like<br>
For example, when the observed system as represented by<br>
the wave function propagates in isolation between the region<br>of preparation and the region of measurement, it develops<br>
* The wave function is the physicist's desciiption of<br>
 At issue is the<br>
interpretation of the wave function and whether it is the best possible descnp<br>tion (or simpl) the only one that fits the<br>
 used bv physicists)<br>
t The wave function, since it is a tool for 0111 undei standing of nature, is something<br>m our thoughts It represents certain<i> specifications</i> of certain<br>
 systems<br>
Specifications are objective in the sense that scientists and technicians can<br>agiee on them Howevei, specifications do not exist apait horn thought Also,<br>
any given physical<br>
 satisfies many sets of specifications, and many physi-<br>
cal<br>
 can satisfy one set of specifications All of these characteristics are<br>
idea-like and, to that extent, that which is represented bv the wave function is<br>idea-like, even though it is objective<br>
However, these specifications aie transcribed into wave functions that de-<br>
velop according to a determined law {the Schiodmgei wave equation) This is a<br>matter-like aspect The thing that develops describes onlv probabilities<br>Probabilities can be thought to describe either things that exist apart from<br>thought, or things that exist only within thought Thus that which the wave<br>
function represents<br>
 both idea-like and matter-like characteristics<br>
<hr>
<A name=101></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-101_1.png"><br>
WHAT HAPPENS / 81<br>
according to a strictly deterministic law (the Schrodinger wave<br>equation). Temporal development in accordance with a causal<br>law is a matter-like characteristic. Therefore, whatever the<br>wave function represents, that something has a matter-like<br>aspect.<br>
However, when the observed system as represented by the<br>
wave function interacts with the observing system (when we<br>make a measurement), it abruptly leaps to a new state. These<br>&quot;Quantum Leap&quot; type transitions are idea-like characteristics.<br>Ideas (like our knowledge about something) can and do change<br>discontinuously. Therefore, whatever the wave function<br>represents, that something also has an idea-like aspect.<br>
The wave function, strictly speaking, represents an observed<br>
system in a quantum mechanical experiment. In more general<br>terms, it describes physical reality at the most fundamental<br>level (the subatomic) that physicists have been able to probe.<br>In fact, according to quantum mechanics, the wave function is<br>
a<i> complete</i> description of physical reality at that level. Most<br>physicists believe that a description of the substructure<br>underlying experience more complete than the wave function<br>is not possible.<br>
&quot;Wait a minute!&quot; says Jim de Wit (where did he come<br>
from?). &quot;The description contained in the wave function con-<br>sists of coordinates (three, six, nine, etc.) and a time (page<br>75). How can that be a complete description of reality? Imag-<br>ine how I felt when my girl friend ran off to Mexico with a<br>gypsy. Where does<i> that</i> show up in a wave function?&quot;<br>
It doesn't. The &quot;complete description&quot; that quantum theory<br>
claims the wave function to be is a description of<i> physical<br></i>reality (as in<i> physics).</i> No matter what we are feeling, or<br>thinking about, or looking at, the wave function describes as<br>completely as possible where and when we are doing it.<br>
Since the wave function is thought to be a complete de-<br>
scription of physical reality and since that which the wave<br>function describes is idea-like as well as matter-like, then<br>physical reality must be both idea-like and matter-like. In<br>other words, the world cannot be as it appears. Incredible-<br>
as it sounds, this is the conclusion of the orthodox view of<br>quantum mechanics. The physical world<i> appears</i> to be com-<br>pletely substantive (made of &quot;stuff&quot;). Nonetheless, if it has an<br>idea-like aspect, the physical world is not substantive in the<br>usual sense of the word (one hundred percent matter, -zero<br>percent idea). According to Stapp.<br>

<A name=102></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-102_1.png"><br>
<IMG src="dancingmasters-102_2.png"><br>
82 / PATTERNS OF ORGANIC ENERGY<br>
If the attitude of quantum mechanics is correct, in the<br>strong sense that a description of the substructure under-<br>lying experience more complete than the one it provides<br>is not possible, then there is no substantive physical world,<br>in the usual sense of this term The conclusion here is<br>not the weak conclusion that there<i> may</i> not be a substantive<br>
physical world but rather that there definitely is not a<br>substantive physical world 6<br>
This does not mean that the world is completely idea-like<br>
The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics does<br>
not go so far as<br>
 say what reality is really like behind the<br>
scenes,' but it does say that it is not like it appears It says<br>that what we perceive to be physical reality is actually our<br>cognitive construction of it This cognitive construction may<br>
appear to be substantive, but the Copenhagen Interpretation<br>of Quantum Mechanics leads directly to the conclusion that<br>the physical world itself is not<br>
This claim at first appears so preposterous and remote from<br>
experience that our inclination is to discard it as the foolish<br>product of cloistered intellectuals However, there are several<br>good reasons why we should not be so hasty The first reason<br>is that quantum mechanics is a logically consistent system It<br>is self-consistent and it also is consistent with all known<br>experiments<br>
Second, the experimental evidence itself is incompatible<br>
with our ordinary ideas about reality<br>
Third, physicists are not the only people who view the<br>
world this way They are only the newest members of a sizable<br>group most Hindus and Buddhists also hold similar views<br>
Therefore, it is evident that even physicists who disclaim<br>
metaphysics have difficulty avoiding it Now we come to those<br>physicists who have jumped feet first into describing &quot;reality &quot;<br>
So far our discussions have been based on the Copenhagen<br>
Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics The unavoidable flaw<br>in this interpretation is the Problem of Measurement Some<br>type of detection by an observing system is required to col-<br>lapse the wave function of the observed svstem into a physical<br>
reality, otherwise the 'observed system' does not physically<br>exist except as an endlessly proliferating number of possibilities<br>generated in accordance with the Schrodmger wave equation<br>

The theory proposed by Hugh Everett, John Wheeler, and<br>
Neill Graham solves this problem m the simplest way possible 7<br>It claims that the wave function is a real thing, all of the<br>possibilities that it represents are real,<i> and they all happen</i><br>
The orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics is that only<br>one of the possibilities contained in the wave function of an<br>observed system actualizes, and the rest vanish The Everett-<br>
Wheelei-Graham theory says that they<i> all</i> actualize, but in<br>
I different worlds that coexist with ours'<br>
Let's go back to the double-slit expenment again A light<br>
source emits a photon The photon can pass through slit one<br>
| or through slit two A detector is placed at slit one and at a slit<br>
two Now we add a new experimental procedure If the photon<br>goes through slit one, I run upstairs If the photon goes through<br>slit two, I run downstairs Therefore, one possible occurrence<br>is that the photon goes through slit one, detector one fires,<br>and I run up the stairs The second possible occurrence is that<br>the photon goes through slit two, detector two fires, and I run<br>
i down the stairs<br>
According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, these two<br>
possibilities are<br>
 exclusive because it is not possible<br>
| for me to run upstairs and to run downstairs at the same time<br>
According to the Everett-Wheeler-Graham theory, at the<br>
moment the wave function 'collapses,' the universe splits<br>into two worlds In one of them I run up the stairs and in the<br>other I run down the stairs There are two distinct editions of<br>
I me Each one of them is doing something different, and each<br>I one of them is unaware of the other Nor will their (our) paths<br>1 ever cross since the two worlds into which the original one<br>| split are forever separate branches of reality<br>
In other words according to the Copenhagen Interpreta-<br>
I tion of Quantum Mechanics, the development of the Schro-<br>I dmger wave equation generates an endlessly proliferating num-<br>1 her of possibilities According to the Everett-Wheeler-Graham<br>I theory the development of the Schrodmger wave equation<br>I generates an endlessly proliferating number of<i> different<br></i>I<i> branches of reality1</i> This theory is called, appropriately, the<br>I Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics<br>
The theoretical advantage of the Many Worlds Interpreta-<br>
I tion is that it does not require an external observer' to &quot;col-<br>I lapse&quot; one of the possibilities contained in a wave function<br>I into physical reality According to the Many Worlds theory,<br>

wave functions do not collapse, they just keep splitting as<br>they develop according to the Schrodmger wave equation<br>When a consciousness happens to be present at such a split, it<br>splits also, one part of it<br>
 with one branch of reality<br>
and the other part(s) of it associating with the other branch(es)<br>of reality However, each branch of reality is<br>maccessable to the other(s), and a consciousness in anv one<br>branch will consider that branch to be the entirety of reality<br>
Therefore, the role of consciousness, which was central to the<br>Copenhagen Interpretation (if consciousness is associated with<br>an act of measurement), is incidental to the Many Worlds<br>
theory<br>
However, the Many Worlds description of the structure of<br>
the relationship between the various branches of physical reality<br>sounds like a quantitative version of a mystical vision of unity<br>
Every state of a subsystem of a composite system is uniquely<br>
correlated to the states of the remaining subsystems which<br>constitute the whole of which it is a part (A ' composite system,&quot;<br>in this case, means a combination of both the observed system<br>and the observing<br>
 In other words, every state of the<br>
observed system system is correlated to a particular state of<br>the observing system)<br>
Said another way, the Many Worlds theory defines any<br>
particular branch of reality which might &quot;actualize&quot; to us as a<br>result of an interaction of an observed system and an observ-<br>ing system as merely one way of decomposing the wave function<br>which represents them both According to this theory, all of<br>the other states which &quot;could have&quot; resulted from the same<br>interaction<i> did happen,</i> but in other branches of reality Each<br>of these branches of reahtv are<i> real,</i> and, together, they con-<br>stitute all the different ways in which we can decompose the<br>universal wave function<br>
In this way, the Problem of Measurement is no longer a<br>
problem The problem of measurement, ultimately, was, Who<br>is looking at the<br>
 The Many Worlds theory says that<br>
it is not necessary to collapse a wave function to actuah/e the<br>universe All of the mutually exclusive possibilities contained<br>

A cat is placed inside a box Inside the box is a device<br>
which can release a gas, instantly killing the Cat A random<br>event (the radioactive decay of an atom) determines whether<br>the gas is released or not There is no way of knowing, outside<br>of looking into the box, what happens inside it The box is<br>sealed and the experiment is activated A moment later, the<br>gas either has been released or has not been released The<br>question is, without looking, what has happened inside the<br>box (This is reminiscent of Einstein's unopenable watch)<br>
According to classical physics, the cat is either dead or it is<br>
not dead All that we have to do is to open the box and see<br>which is the case According to quantum mechanics, the<br>situation is not so simple<br>

 possibilities actualizes and<br>
the other vanishes This is known as the collapse of the wave<br>function because the hump in the wave function representing<br>the possibility that did not occur, collapses It is necessary to<br>look into the box before either<br>
 can occur Until<br>
then, there is only a wave function<br>
Of course this does not make sense Experience tells us<br>
that a cat is what we put into the box and a cat is still what is<br>inside the box, not a wave function The only question is<br>whether the cat is a live cat or a dead cat But a cat<br>

whether we look at it or not If we take a vacation before we<br>look inside the box, it makes no difference as far as the cat is<br>concerned Its fate was decided at the<br>
 of the<br>
experiment<br>
This commonsense view is also the view of classical phvsics<br>
According to classical physics we get to know something bv<br>observing it According to quantum mechanics, it isn<i> t there<br></i>until we do observe it' Therefore, the fate of the cat is not<br>determined until we look inside the box<br>
The Mam Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics<br>
and the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics<br>agree that the fate of the cat is not determined for us until we<br>look inside the box What happens after we look inside the<br>box however, depends upon which interpretation we choose<br>to follow According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, at the<br>instant that we look inside the box, one of the possibilities<br>contained in the wave function representing the cat actualizes<br>and the other possibility vanishes The cat is either dead or<br>alive<br>
According to the Many Worlds Interpretation, at the instant<br>
that the atom decays (or doesn t decay, depending upon which<br>branch of reality we are talking about), the world splits into<br>two branches, each with a different edition of the cat The<br>wave function representing the cat does not collapse The cat<br>is both dead<i> and</i> alive At the instant that we look into the<br>box, our wave function also splits into two branches, one<br>associated with the branch of reality in which the cat is dead<br>

In short, classical physics says that there is one world, it is<br>
as it appears, and this is it Quantum physics allows us to<br>entertain the possibility that this is not so The Copenhagen<br>Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics eschews a description<br>of what the world is really like, but concludes that whatever<br>it is like, it is not substantive in the usual sense The Many<br>Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics savs that differ-<br>ent editions of us live in many worlds simultaneously, an<br>uncountable number of them, and all of them are real There<br>are even more interpretations of quantum mechanics, but all<br>of them are weird in some way<br>
Quantum physics is stranger than science fiction<br>
Quantum mechanics is a theory and a procedure dealing<br>
with subatomic phenomena Subatomic phenomena, in gener-<br>al are inaccessible to all but those with access to elaborate<br>
(and expensive) facilities Even at the most expensive and<br>
elaborate facilities, however, we can see only the effects of<br>subatomic phenomena The subatomic realm is<br>
 the<br>
limits of sensorv perception * It is also beyond the limits of<br>rational understanding Of course, we have rational theories<br>about it, but rational has been stretched to include what<br>
Iformerly was nonsense or, at best paradox<br>
The world that we live in, the world of freeways, bathtubs,<br>
and other people, seems as remote as it can be from wave<br>functions and interference In short the<br>
 of<br>
quantum mechanics is based upon an unsubstantiated leap<br>from the microscopic to the macroscopic Can we applv these<br>implications of subatomic research to the world at<br>
No, not if we have to provide a mathematical proof in each<br>
instance But what is a<br>
 A proof onlv proves that we are<br>
plaving by the rules (We make the rules, anvway) The rules,<br>in this case, are that what we propose about the nature of<br>physical reality (1) be<br>
 consistent, and (2) that it corre-<br>
spond to experience There is nothing in the rules that savs<br>that what we propose has to be anything like reality &quot; Phys-<br>ics is a self-consistent explanation of experience It is in order<br>to satisfy the self-consistency requirement of physics that proofs<br>become important<br>

The New Testament presents a different point of view. Christ,<br>
following His resurrection, proved to Thomas (who became<br>the proverbial &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot;) that He really was He,<br>risen from the dead, by showing Thomas His wounds. At the<br>
same time, however, Christ bestowed His special favor on<br>those who believed Him<i> without proof.</i><br>
Acceptance without proof is the fundamental characteristic<br>
of western religion. Rejection without proof is the fundamental<br>characteristic of western science. In other words, religion has<br>become a matter of the heart and science has become a mat-<br>ter of the mind. This regrettable state of affairs does not reflect<br>the fact that, physiologically, one cannot exist without the<br>other. Everybody needs both. Mind and heart are only differ-<br>ent aspects of<i> us.</i><br>
Who, then, is right? Should disciples believe without proof?<br>
Should scientists insist on it? Is the world without substance?<br>Is it real, but divided and dividing into countless branches?<br>

The Role of 'T<br>
In the days before Copernicus discovered that the earth revolves<br>around the sun, the common belief was that the sun, along<br>with the rest of the universe, revolved around the earth. The<br>earth was the fixed center of everything. At a still earlier time<br>in India, this geocentric position was given to people. That is,<br>each person, psychologically speaking, was recognized as being<br>the center of the universe. Although this sounds like an<br>egotistical point of view, it was not since<i> every</i> person was<br>recognized as a divine manifestation.<br>
A beautiful Hindu painting shows Lord Krishna dancing in<br>
the moonlight on the bank of the Yamuna. He moves in the<br>center of a circle of fair Vraja women. They are all in love<br>with Krishna and they are dancing with him. Krishna is danc-<br>ing with all of the souls of the world—man is dancing with<br>himself. To dance with god, the creator of all things, is to<br>
dance with ourselves. This is a recurrent theme of eastern<br>literature.<br>
This is also the direction toward which the new physics,<br>
quantum mechanics and relativity, seems to point. From the<br>revolutionary concepts of relativity and the logic-defying<br>paradoxes of quantum mechanics an ancient paradigm is<br>emerging. In vague form, we begin to glimpse a conceptual<br>framework in which each of us shares a paternity in the crea-<br>tion of physical reality. Our old self-image as impotent by-<br>stander, one who sees but does not affect, is dissolving.<br>
We are watching perhaps the most engaging act in our<br>
history. Amid the powerful purr of particle accelerators, the<br>

With the awesome authority<br>
 we have given it, science<br>
is telling us that our faith has been misplaced It appears that<br>we have attempted the impossible, to disown our part in the<br>universe We have tried to do this by relinquishing our au-<br>thority to the Scientists To the Scientists we gave the<br>responsibility of probing the mysteries of creation, change,<br>and death To us we gave the everydav routine of mindless<br>living<br>
The Scientists readily assumed their task We readily assumed<br>
ours, which was to play a role of impotence before the ever-<br>increasing complexity of &quot;modern science ' and the ever-<br>spreading specialization of modern technology<br>
Now, after three centuries, the Scientists have returned<br>
with their discoveries They are as perplexed as we are (those<br>of them who have given thought to what is happening)<br>
&quot;We are not sure,&quot; they tell us, &quot;but we have accumulated<br>
evidence which indicates that the key to understanding the<br>universe is<i> you</i><br>
This is not only different from the wav that we have looked<br>
at the world for three hundred years, it is<i> opposite</i> The<br>distinction between the 'in here&quot; and the &quot;out there&quot; upon<br>which science was founded, is becorrung blurred This is a<br>puzzling state of affairs Scientists, using the &quot;in here—out<br>there' distinction, have discovered that the &quot;in here—out<br>there' distinction may not exist' What is &quot;out there&quot; apparently<br>depends, in a rigorous mathematical sense as well as a<br>philosophical one, upon what we decide 'in here &quot;<br>
The new physics tells us that an observer cannot observe<br>
without altering what he sees Observer and observed are<br>interrelated in a real and fundamental sense The exact nature<br>of this interrelation is not clear, but there is a growing body of<br>evidence that the distinction between the &quot;in here&quot; and the<br>
'out there&quot; is illusion<br>
The conceptual framework of quantum mechanics, supported<br>
by massive volumes of experimental data, forces contemporary<br>physicists to express themselves in a manner that sounds,<br>even to the uninitiated, like the language of mystics<br>

the experiencing In short, what we experience is not external<br>reality, but our<i> interaction</i> with it This is a fundamental<br>assumption of &quot;complementarity<br>
Complementarity is the concept developed by Niels Bohr to<br>
explain the wave-particle duality of light No one has thought<br>of a better one yet Wave-like characteristics and particle-like<br>
characteristics, the theon goes are mutually exclusive, or<br>complementary aspects of light Although one of them always<br>excludes the other,<i> both</i> of them are necessarv to understand<br>light One of them always excludes the other because light, or<br>anything else, cannot be both wave-like and particle-like at<br>the same time *<br>
How can mutually exclusive wave-like and particle-like be-<br>
haviors both be properties of one and the same<br>
 They<br>
are not properties of light Thev are properties of our<i> interac-<br>tion</i> with light Depending upon our choice of experiment,<br>we can cause light to manifest either particle-like properties<br>
or wave-like properties If we choose to demonstrate the wave-<br>
like characteristics of light, we can perform the double-slit<br>experiment which produces interference If we choose to dem-<br>onstrate the particle-like characteristics of light we can per-<br>
form an experiment which illustrates the photoelectric effect<br>We can cause light to manifest both wave-like properties and<br>particle-like properties by performing Arthur Compton's famous<br>experiment<br>
In 1923, Compton played the world s first game of billiards<br>
with subatomic particles, and, in the process, confirmed<br>Einstein's seventeen-year-old photon theory of light His<br>experiment was not conceptually difficult He simply fired<br>x-ravs, which everybody knows are waves, at electrons To<br>the surprise of most people, the x-rays bounced off the electrons<br>as if they (the x-rays) were particles' For example, the x-rays<br>which struck the electrons glancing blows were deflected onl)<br>slightly from their paths Thev did not lose much energy in<br>the collision However, those x-ravs which collided more nearly<br>head-on with electrons were deflected sharply These x-rays<br>
lost a considerable amount of their kinetic energy (the energy<br>of motion) in the collision<br>

Compton could tell just how much energy the deflected<br>
x-rays lost by measuring their frequencies before and after the<br>collision. The frequencies of those x-rays involved in near<br>head-on collisions were noticeably lower after the collision<br>than before it. This meant that they had less energy after the<br>collision than they had before the collision. Compton s x-rays<br>were impacting with electrons exactly the way that billiard<br>balls impact with other billiard balls.<br>
Compton's discovery was intimately related to quantum<br>
theory. Compton could not have revealed the particle-like<br>behavior of x-rays if Planck had not discovered his fundamental<br>rule that higher frequency means higher energy. This rule<br>
permitted Compton to prove that the x-rays in his experiment<br>
lost energy in a particle-like collision (because their frequen-<br>
cies were lower after the collision than before the collision).<br>
The conceptual paradox in Compton's experiment shows<br>
how deeply the wave-particle duality is embedded in quantum<br>mechanics. Compton proved that electromagnetic radiations,<br>like x-rays, have particle-like characteristics by measuring their<br>
frequencies! Of course, &quot;particles&quot; don't have frequencies. Only<br>waves have frequencies. The phenomenon which Compton<br>discovered is called Compton scattering, in honor of what<br>happens to the x-rays.<br>
In- short, we can demonstrate the light is particle-like with<br>
the photoelectric effect, that it is wave-like with the double-<br>slit experiment, and that it is both particle-like and wave-like<br>
with Compton scattering. Both of these complementary aspects<br>of light (wave and particle) are necessary to understand the<br>nature of light. It is meaningless to ask which one of them,<br>alone, is the way light really is. Light behaves like waves<br>

THE ROLE OF &quot;1&quot; / 95<br>
or like particles depending upon which experiment we perform.<br>
The &quot;we&quot; that does the experimenting is the common link<br>
that connects light as particles and light<br>
 waves. The wave-<br>
like behavior that we observe in the double-slit experiment is<br>not a property of light, it is a property of our interaction with<br>light. Similarly, the particle-like characteristics that we ob-<br>serve in the photoelectric effect are not a property of light<br>
They, too, are a property of our interaction with light. Wave-<br>like behavior and particle-like behavior are properties of<i> inter-<br>actions .</i><br>
Since particle-like behavior and wave-like behavior are the<br>
only properties that we ascribe to light, and since these<br>properties now are recognized to belong (if complementarity<br>is correct) not to light itself, but to our interaction with light,<br>
then it appears that light has no properties independent of us!<br>To say that something has no properties is the same as saying<br>
that it does not exist. The next step is this logic is inescapable.<br>Without us, light does not exist.<br>
Transferring the properties that we usually ascribe to light<br>
to our interaction with light deprives light of an independent<br>existence. Without us, or by implication, anything else to<br>interact with, light does not exist. This remarkable conclusion<br>is only half the story. The other half is that, in a similar<br>manner, without light, or, by implication, anything else to<br>
interact with,<i> we do not exist]</i> As Bohr himself put it:<br>
. . . an independent reality in the<br>
 physical sense<br>
can be ascribed neither to the phenomena nor to the<br>agencies of observation.1<br>
By &quot;agencies of observation,&quot; he may have been referring<br>
to instruments, not people, but philosophically, complemen-<br>tarity leads to the conclusion that the world consists not of<br>things, but of interactions. Properties belong to interactions,<br>not to independently existing things, like &quot;light.&quot; This is the<br>way that Bohr solved the wave-particle duality of light. The<br>philosophical implications of complementarity became even<br>
more pronounced with the discovery that the wave-particle<br>duality is a characteristic of<br>

Einstein, stimulated bv Planck s discovery of quanta used<br>
the photoelectric effect to illustrate his theorv that not only<br>are the processes of energy absorption and emission quantized,<br>but that<i> energy itself</i><br>
<i> m</i> packages of certain sizes Thus<br>
physicists were confronted with two sets of experiments<br>(repeatable experiences) each of which seemed to disprove<br>the other This is the famous wave-particle duahtv which is<br>fundamental to quantum mechanics<br>
While phvsicists were trvmg to explain how waves can be<br>
particles, a young French prince, Louis de Broghe, dropped a<br>bomb which demolished what was left of the classical view<br>Not only are waves particles, he proposed, but particles are<br>also waves'<br>
De Broghe s idea (which<br>
 contained in his doctoral thesis)<br>
was that matter has waves which &quot;correspond ' to it The idea<br>was more than philosophical speculation It was also mathe-<br>matical speculation Using the simple equations of Planck and<br>
Einstein, de Broghe formulated a simple equation of his own *<br>It determines the<br>
 of the &quot;matter waves&quot; that &quot;cor-<br>
respond ' to matter It says simply that the greater the mo-<br>
mentum of a particle, the shorter is the length of its associated<br>wave<br>
This explains<br>
 matter waves are not evident in the<br>
macroscopic world De Broghe s equation tells us that the<br>matter waves corresponding to even the smallest object that<br>
w e can see are so mcrediblv small compared to the size of the<br>object that their effect is negligible However, when we get<br>down to something as small as a subatomic particle like an<br>electron, the<br>
 of the electron itself is smaller than the<br>
length of its associated wave'<br>
Under these circumstances the wave-like behavior of mat-<br>
ter should be clearlv evident, and matter should behave<br>differentlv than ' matter&quot; as we are used to thinking of it This<br>is exactly what happens<br>

Only two years after de Broghe presented this hypothesis,<br>
an experimenter named Clinton Davisson, working with his<br>assistant, Lester Germer at the Bell Telephone Laboratories,<br>verified it experimentally Both Davisson and de Broghe got<br>Nobel Prizes, and physicists were left to explain not only how<br>waves can be particles, but also how particles can be waves<br>

by accident, showed electrons reflecting off a cr&gt; stal surface<br>in a manner that could<br>

The unfolding of quantum mechanics was (and still is) a<br>

I remember discussions with Bohr [in 1927] which went<br>through many hours till verv late at night and ended<br>
almost in despair, and when at the end of the discussion I<br>went alone for a walk in the neighboring park I repeated<br>to myself again and again the question Can nature possibly<br>be as absurd as it seemed to us in these atomic experi-<br>
Subsequent experiments were to reveal that not only<br>
subatomic particles, but atoms and molecules as well have<br>associated matter waves The title of Donald Hughes pioneer<br>book,<i> Neutron</i><br>

people—although their wavelengths are so small that thev are<br>not noticeable<br>
De Broglie himself was not verv helpful in explaining his<br>

This is why the physicists at Copenhagen decided to accept<br>
quantum mechanics as a complete theory even though it gives<br>no explanation of what the world is &quot;really like,&quot; and even<br>though it predicts probabilities and not actual events They<br>accepted quantum mechanics as a complete theory because<br>quantum mechanics correctly correlates experience Quantum<br>mechanics, and, according to the pragmatists, all science, is<br>the study of correlations between experiences De Broghe's<br>equation correctly correlates expenences<br>
De Broghe merged the wave-particle paradox which came<br>
to light (hissss) through the genius of Thomas Young (double-<br>slit experiment) and Albert Einstein<br>
 theory) In other<br>
words, he connected the<br>
 most revolutionary phenomena<br>
of physics, the quantum nature of energy and the wave-<br>particle duality<br>
De Broghe presented his matter-wave theory in 1924 During<br>
the next three years quantum mechanics<br>
 into what<br>
it essentially is today The world of Newtonian physics, simple<br>mental pictures and common sense disappeared A new phys-<br>ics took form with an originality and force that left the mind<br>reeling<br>
After de Broglie's matter waves came the Schrodmger wave<br>
equation<br>
De Broglie's matter waves seemed to Erwm Schrodmger,<br>
the Viennese physicist a much more natural way of looking at<br>
atomic phenomena than Bohr's planetary model oi the atom<br>
Bohr s model of hard, spherical electrons revolving around a<br>nucleus at specific levels and emitting photons by jumping<br>
from one level to another explained the color spectrum of<br>simple atoms, but it said nothing about why each shell contains<br>onlv a certain number of electrons, no more and no less It<br>also did not explain<br>
 the electrons do their jumping (for<br>
example, what s happening to them between shells) *<br>

<b>100 /MY WAY</b><br>
Standing waves are familiar phenomena to anyone who has<br>
played with a clothesline Suppose that we tie one end of a<br>rope to a pole, and then pull it tight On this rope there are<br>no waves at all, either standing or traveling Now suppose<br>that we flick our wrist sharply downward and then upward A<br>hump appears in the rope and travels down the rope to the<br>pole where it turns upside down and returns to our hand<br>
This traveling hump (figure A) is a traveling wave Bv sending<br>
a series of humps down the rope, we can set up the patterns<br>of standing waves shown below, and more that are not shown<br>
The simplest of these is the pattern shown in figure B This<br>
pattern is formed bv the superposition of two traveling waves,<br>a direct one and a reflected one traveling in the opposite<br>direction It is the pattern, not the rope, which does not<br>move The widest point in the standing wave remains &quot;sta-<br>tionary,&quot; and so do the points at the ends of the standing<br>wave These points are called nodes There are two of them in<br>the simplest standing pattern, one at our hand and one at the<br>pole where the rope is attached These stationary patterns,<br>superpositions of traveling waves, are called standing waves<br>
No matter how long or short our rope is, there can be only<br>
a whole number of standing waves on it That is, it can have a<br>pattern of one standing wave, or a pattern of two standing<br>waves, or a pattern of three, four, five, and so on, standing<br>waves but it can never have a pattern of one and one half<br>standing waves, or a pattern of two and one fourth standing<br>waves The standing waves must divide the rope evenly into<br>whole sections Another way to sa&gt; this is that we can in-<br>crease or decrease the number of standing waves on a rope<br>only by a whole number of them This means that the only<br>way that the number of standing waves on a rope can increase<br>
or decrease is<br>
 (that word, again')<br>
Furthermore, standing waves on a rope cannot be just anv<br>
size They always will be restricted to those lengths which<br>
divide the rope evenly The actual size of the waves depends<br>upon how long the rope is but no matter what length the<br>rope there will be only certain lengths which divide it evenlv<br>
All of this was old stuff in 1925 Plucking a guitar string<br>
establishes patterns of standing waves on it Blowing air into<br>an organ pipe creates standing wave patterns in it What was<br>new was Schrodmger s realization that<i> standing waves are<br>&quot;quantized&quot; the same</i><br>

fact, Schrodmger proposed that electrons<i> are</i> standing waves<br>
In retrospect, this is not as fantastic as it first sounds At the<br>
time, however, it was a stroke of genius Picture an electron<br>in orbit around a nucleus Each time the electron completes a<br>
journey around the nucleus, it travels a certain distance That<br>
distance is a certain length, like our rope was a certain length<br>Similarly, only a whole number of standing waves, never a<br>fraction of one, can form in this length (Length of what is an<br>unanswered question)<br>
Schrodmger proposed that each of these standing waves is<br>
an electron' In other words, he proposed that electrons are<br>the segments of vibrations bounded by the nodes<br>
So far, we have talked about standing waves on a line, like a<br>
clothesline or a guitar string, but standing waves also occur in<br>other mediums, like water Suppose that we throw a rock into<br>a round pool Waves radiate from its point of entry These<br>waves are reflected, sometimes more than once, off different<br>sides of the pool When the reflected traveling waves inter-<br>fere with each other they create a complex pattern of standing<br>
waves which is our old friend, interference<br>

Where the crest of one wave meets the trough of another<br>
wave, they cancel each other and the surface of the water<br>along this line of interaction is calm. These calm areas are the<br>nodes which separate the standing waves. In the double-slit<br>experiment, the nodes are the dark bands in the pattern of<br>alternating light and dark areas. The light bands are the crests<br>of the standing waves.<br>
Schrodinger chose the model of a small tub of water with its<br>
complex and intricate interference pattern to explain the na-<br>ture of the atom. This model is, as he put it, an &quot;analogue&quot; oi<br>electron waves in an atom-sized basin.<br>
The ingenious but nevertheless somewhat artificial as-<br>sumptions of [Bohr's model of the atom] . . . are replaced<br>by a much more natural assumption in de Broglie's wave<br>phenomena. The wave phenomenon forms the real &quot;body&quot;<br>of the atom. It replaces the individual punctiform [pointlike]<br>
electrons, which in Bohr's model swarm around the<br>nucleus.4<br>
Standing waves on clotheslines have two dimensions: length<br>
and width. Standing waves in mediums like water, or on the<br>head of a conga drum, have three dimensions: length, width,<br>and depth. Schrodinger analyzed the standing wave patterns<br>

of the simplest atom, hydrogen, which has only one electron<br>In hydrogen alone he calculated, using his new wave equation,<br>a multitude of different possible shapes of standing waves. All<br>of the standing waves on a rope are identical. This is not true<br>of the standing waves in an atom. All of them are three-<br>dimensional and all of them are different. Some of them look<br>like concentric circles. Some of them look like butterflies, and<br>others look like mandalas (see below).<br>
Shortly before Schrodinger's discovery, another Austrian<br>
physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, discovered that no two electrons<br>in an atom can be exactly alike. The presence of an electron<br>with one particular set of properties (&quot;quantum numbers&quot;)<br>excludes the presence of another electron with exactly the<br>same properties (quantum numbers) within the same atom.<br>
For this reason, Pauli's discovery became known as the Pauli<br>

distributions of different electron states in the hydrogen atom. In other words,<br>they represent where we are most likely to find the point-like electron when we<br>look for it if the atom is in this or that particular state (there are more states<br>than those shown). Initially, Schrodinger pictured electrons as being tenuous<br>
clouds actually assuming these patterns.<br>t A &quot;quantum jump&quot; can be thought of as a transition from one of these pictures<br>to another<i> without anything in between.</i><br>

exclusion principle In terms of Schrodmger's standing wave<br>theory, Pauli s exclusion principle means that once a particu-<br>lar wave pattern forms in an atom it excludes all others of its<br>kind<br>
Schrodmger s equation, modified by Pauli's discovery shows<br>
that there are only two possible wave patterns in the lowest of<br>
Bohr s energy levels or shells Therefore, there can be only<br>two electrons in it There are eight different standing-wave<br>
patterns possible in the next energy level, therefore there can<br>be only eight electrons in it, and so on<br>
These are exactly the numbers of electrons that Bohr's model<br>
assigns to these energy levels In this respect, the two models<br>are alike In another important way, however they are<br>different<br>
Bohr s theory was entirely empirical That is he built it<br>
around the experimentally observed facts to explain them In<br>contrast, Schrodmger built his theory on de Broghe s matter-<br>wave hypothesis Not only does it vield mathematical values<br>which have been verified experimentally but it also provides<br>a consistent explanation for them<br>
For example there are only a certain number of electrons<br>
in each energy level, because there are only a certain number<br>of standing wave patterns possible at each energy level The<br>energy level of an atom jumps only from certain specific values<br>to other certain specific values because standing-wave pat-<br>terns of only certain dimensions can form with the atom and<br>none other<br>

waves, he was not sure what was waving * He was convinced,<br>
nonetheless that<br>
 was waving and he tailed it<i> pst,</i><br>

THE ROLE OF &quot;I&quot; / 105<br>
To use the Schrodmger wave equation we feed it certain<br>
characteristics of the atom in question It then gives us the<br>evolution in time of standing-wave patterns which occur in<br>the atom If we prepare an atom in an initial state and let it<br>propagate in isolation that initial state, while propagating in<br>isolation, evolves in time into different standing-wave patterns<br>
The order of these patterns is calculable The Schrodmger<br>wave equation is the mathematical device which physicists<br>
use to calculate the order of these patterns Said another way,<br>the development of standing wave patterns in an atom is<br>deterministic Given initial conditions one pattern always<br>
follows another in accordance with the Schrodmger wave<br>equation t<br>
The Schrodmger wave equation also provides a<br>
explanation of the size of the hvdrogen atom According to it<br>the wave pattern of a system with one electron and one proton,<br>which is what we call a hydrogen atom in its lowest energy<br>state, has an appreciable magnitude only within a sphere which<br>is just the diameter of the smallest Bohr orbit In other words,<br>such a wave pattern turns out to be the same size as the<br>ground state of a hydrogen atom1<br>
Although Schrodmger s wave mechanics became a pillar of<br>
todav s quantum mechanics the useful aspects of Bohr s model<br>of subatomic phenomena still are used when the wave theory<br>does not yield appropriate results In such cases physicists<br>Simply stop thinking in terms of standing waves and start<br>thinking again in terms of particles No one can sav that they<br>are not adaptable in this matter (wave)<br>
Schrodmger was convinced that his equations described real<br>
things, and not mathematical abstractions He pictured electrons<br>as actually being spread out over their wave patterns in the<br>form of a tenuous cloud If the picture is limited to the one-<br>electron hydrogen atom, whose standing waves have only three<br>dimensions (length width and depth) this is possible to imag-<br>ine However, the standing waves in an atom with two electrons<br>exist in six mathematical dimensions the standing waves in an<br>atom with four electrons exist in twelve dimensions etc To<br>visualize this is quite an exercise<br>

touch to the new wave interpretation of subatomic phenomena.<br>According to him, it is not necessary or possible to visualize<br>these waves because they are<i> not</i> real things, they are<br><i>probability waves.</i><br>
<i>. . .</i> the whole course of events is determined by the laws<br>
of probability; to a state in space there corresponds a<br>definite probability, which is given by the de Brogile<br>
 associated with the state.<br>
To obtain the probability of a given state we square (multiply<br>
by itself) the amplitude of the matter wave associated with the<br>state.<br>
The question of whether de Broglie's equations and Schro-<br>
dinger's equations represent real things or abstractions was<br>clear to Born. It did not make sense to him to try to think of a<br>real thing that exists in more than three dimensions.<br>
We have two possibilities. Either we use waves in spaces<br>
of more than three dimensions  . . . or we remain in three-<br>dimensional space, but give up the simple picture of the<br>wave amplitude as an ordinary physical magnitude, and<br>
replace it by a purely abstract mathematical concept . . .<br>into which we cannot enter.6<br>
This is exactly what he did. &quot;Physics,&quot; he wrote,<br>
is in the nature of the case indeterminate, and therefore<br>the affair of statistics.7<br>
This is the same idea (probability waves) that Bohr,<br>
and Slater had thought of earlier. This time, however, using<br>the mathematics of de Broglie and Schrodinger, the numbers<br>
came out right.<br>
Born's contribution to Schrodinger's theory is what enables<br>
quantum mechanics to predict probabilities. Since the proba-<br>bility of a state is found by squaring the amplitude of the<br>matter wave associated with it, and, given initial conditions,<br>the Schrodinger equation predicts the evolution of these wave<br>
patterns, the two taken together give a determinable evolution<br>of probabilities. Given any initial state, physicists can predict<br>the probability that an observed system will be observed to<br>be in any other given state at any particular time. Whether or<br>not the observed system is observed to be in that state, how-<br>

ever, even if that state is the most probable state for that<br>time, is a matter of chance. In other words, the &quot;probability&quot;<br>of quantum mechanics is the probability of observing an ob-<br>served system in a given state at a given time if it was prepared<br>in a given initial state.*<br>
Thus it was that the wave aspect of quantum mechanics<br>
deVeloped. Just as waves have particle-like characteristics<br>(Planck, Einstein), particles also have wave-like characteristics<br>(de Broglie). In fact, particles can be understood in terms of<br>standing waves (Schrodinger). Given initial conditions, a precise<br>evolution of standing-wave patterns can be calculated via the<br>Schrodinger wave equation. Squaring the amplitude of a mat-<br>ter wave (wave function) gives the probability of the state that<br>corresponds to that wave (Born). Therefore, a sequence of<br>probabilities can be calculated from initial conditions by using<br>the Schrodinger wave equation and Horn's simple formula.<br>
We have come a long way from Galileo's experiments with<br>
falling bodies. Each step along the path has taken us to a<br>higher level of abstraction: first to the creation of things that<br>no one has ever seen (like electrons), and then to the aban-<br>donment of all attempts even to picture our abstractions.<br>
The problem is, however, that human nature being what it<br>
is, we do not stop trying to picture these abstractions. We<br>keep asking &quot;What are these abstractions of?&quot;, and then we<br>try to visualize whatever that is.<br>
Earlier we dismissed Bohr's planetary model of the atom<br>
with the promise that we later would see &quot;how physicists<br>currently think of an atom.&quot; Well, the time has come, but the<br>task is a thorny one. We gave up our old picture of the atom<br>so easily because we assumed that it would be replaced by<br>one more meaningful, but equally as lucid. Now it develops<br>that our replacement picture is not a picture at all, but an<br>unvisualizable abstraction. This is uncomfortable because it<br>reminds us that atoms were never &quot;real&quot; things anyway. Atoms<br>are hypothetical entities constructed to make experimental<br>observations intelligible. No one, not one person, has ever<br>seen an atom. Yet we are so used to the<i> idea</i> that an atom is a<br>

thing that we forget that it is an idea Now we are told that<br>
not only is an atom an idea, it is an idea that we cannot even<br>picture<br>
Nonetheless, when physicists refer to mathematical entities<br>
in English (or German or Danish), the words that they use are<br>bound to create images foi laymen who hear them, but who<br>
are not familiar with the mathematics to which they refer<br>Therefore, gi\en this lengthy explanation of why it cannot be<br>done, we come now to how physicists today picture an atom<br>
An atom consists of a nucleus and electrons The nucleus is<br>
located at the center of the atom It occupies only a small part<br>of the atom's volume, but almost all of its mass This is the<br>same nucleus as in the planetary model As in the planetary<br>model, electrons move in the general area of the nucleus In<br>this model, however, the electrons mav be anvwhere within<br>an ' electron cloud &quot; The electron cloud is made of various<br>standing waves which surround the nucleus These standing<br>
waves are not material They are patterns of potential The<br>shape of the various standing waves which comprise the electron<br>cloud tolls physicists the probability of finding the point electron<br>at anv given place in the cloud<br>
In short, physicists still think of an atom as a nucleus around<br>
which move electrons, but the picture is not so simple as that<br>of a tiny solar system The electron cloud is a mathematical<br>concept which physicists have constructed to correlate their<br>experiences Electron clouds mav or may not exist within an<br>atom No one re all v knows<br>
 we do know that the<br>
concept of an electron cloud yields the probabilities of finding<br>the electron at various places around the nucleus of an atom,<br>and that these probabilities have been determined empirically<br>to be accurate<br>
In this sense, electron clouds are like wave functions A<br>
wave function also is a mathematical concept which physicists<br>have constructed to correlate their experiences Wave functions<br>may or may not' actually exist &quot; (This type of statement assumes<br>a qualitative difference between thought and matter, which<br>mav not be a good assumption) However, the concept of a<br>wave function undeniably yields the probabilities of observing<br>a system to be in a given state at a given time if it was<br>prepared in a given way<br>
Like wave functions, electron clouds generally cannot be<br>

The situation, in terms of mental pictures, is clearly unclear<br>
This ambiguity results from attempting to depict with lim-<br>
ited concepts (language) situations which are not bound by<br>the same limitations It also masks the fact that<br>
<i> do not</i><br>
<i>know</i> what actually is going on in the invisible subatomic<br>realm The models that we use are 'free ci cations of the<br>human mind,&quot; to use Einstein's words (page 8), that satisfy<br>our innate need to correlate experience rationally They are<br>guesses about what ' really' goes on inside the unopenable<br>
watch It is extremely misleading to think that they actually<br>describe anything<br>
In fact, a young German physicist, Werner Heisenberg,<br>
decided that we<i> never</i> can know what actually goes on in the<br>invisible subatomic realm, and that, therefore, we should &quot;aban-<br>don all attempts to construct perceptual models of atomic<br>processes &quot;8 All that we legitimately can work with according<br>to this theory, is what we observe directlv All we know is<br>what we<br>
 at the beginning of an experiment and what we<br>
have at the end of it Any<br>
 of what<br>
 hap-<br>
pens between these two states—which are the observables<br>(page 70)—is speculation<br>
Therefore, about the same time (1925), but independently<br>
of de Brogbe and Schrodmger, the twenty-five-year-old<br>
Heisenberg set about developing a means of organizing<br>
experimental data into tabular form He was fortunate in that<br>sixty-six years earlier an Irish mathematician named W R<br>

Hamilton's matrices were considered the fringe of pure math-<br>
ematics Who could have guessed that one dav the\ would fit,<br>like a precut piece, into the structure of a revolutionary<br>physics'1<br>
To use Heisenberg's tables, we simply read from them, or<br>
calculate from them, what probabilities are associated with<br>what initial conditions Using this method, which Heisenberg<br>called matrix mechanics, we deal only with physical observa-<br>

After twenty-five years of struggling for a theory to replace<br>
Newtonian physics, physicists suddenly found themselves with<br>two different theories each one a unique way of approaching<br>the same thing Schrodmger's wave mechanics, based on de<br>
 s matter waves, and Heisenberg s matnx mechanics,<br>
based on the<br>
 of subatomic phenomena<br>
Within a vear after Heisenberg developed his matrix me-<br>
chanics, Schrodmger discovered that it was mathematically<br>equivalent to his own wave mechanics Since both of these<br>theories were valuable tools for subatomic research, both of<br>them were incorporated into the new branch of physics which<br>became known as quantum mechanics<br>
Much later, Heisenberg applied matrix mathematics to the<br>
particle collision experiments of high-energy particle physics<br>Because such collisions always result in a scattering of parti-<br>cles, it was called the Scattering Matrix, which was shortened<br>to the S Matrix Today, physicists have two ways to calculate<br>the transition probabilities between what they obsen e at the<br>beginning of a quantum mechanical experiment and what they<br>observe at the end of it<br>
The first method is the Schrodmger wave equation, and the<br>
second method<br>
 the S Matrix The Schrodmger wave equation<br>
describes a temporal development of possibilities, one of which<br>suddenly actualizes when we make a measurement in the<br>course of a quantum mechanical experiment The S Matrix<br>gives directly the transition probabilities between the observ-<br>ables without giving any indication of a development in time,<br>or the lack of it, or anything else Both of them work *<br>
As important as was Heisenberg s introduction of matrix<br>
mathematics into the new phvsics, his next discovery shook<br>the very foundations  o f ' the exact sciences ' He proved that,<br>
at the subatomic level, there is no such thing as &quot;the exact<br>
* The Schrrxiinger wave equation works at lower energies however sine e it is<br>nonreiativistK it does not work foi high<br>
 Therefoie most particle<br>
physicists use the S Matrix together perhaps with local<br>
 quantum<br>
fields to understand quarks and particles<br>

THE ROLE OF &quot;I&quot;  / 1 1 1<br>
Heisenberg's remarkable discovery was that there are limits<br>
beyond which we cannot measure accurately, at the same<br>time, the processes of nature These limits are not imposed<br>by the clumsy nature of our measuring<br>
 or the<br>
extremely small sue of the entities that we attempt to meas-<br>ure, but rather by the very wav that nature presents itself to<br>us' In other words, there exists an ambiguity<br>
 beyond<br>
which we never can pass without venturing into the realm of<br>uncertainty For this reason, Heisenberg s discovery became<br>known as the ' uncertainty principle '<br>
The uncertainty principle reveals that as we penetrate deeper<br>
and deeper into the<br>
 realm wt reach a certain point<br>
at which one part or another of our picture of natuie becomes<br>blurred, and there is no way to<br>
 that part without<br>
blurring another part of the picture' It is as though we are<br>adjusting a moving picture that is slightly out of focus As we<br>make the final adjustments, we are astonished to discover that<br>when the right side of the picture clears, the left side of the<br>picture becomes completely unfocused and nothing in it is<br>recognizable When we try to focus the left side of the pic-<br>ture, the right side starts to blur and soon the situation is<br>reversed If we try to strike a balance between these two<br>
extremes, both sides of the picture return to a recognizable<br>condition, but in no way can we remove the original fu/zmess<br>from them<br>
The right sidf of the picture, in the original formulation of<br>
the uncertainty principle, corresponds to the position in space<br>of a mov ing particle The left side of the picture corresponds<br>to its momentum According to the uncertainty principle<br>
cannot measure accurately at the same tune, both the position<br><i>and</i> the momentum of a moving particle The more precisely<br>we determine one of these properties, the less we kno\v about<br>the other If we<br>
 determine the position of the parti-<br>
cle, then, strange as it sounds, there is<i> nothing</i> that we can<br>know about its momentum If we precisely determine the<br>
momentum of the particle, there is no wav to determine its<br>position<br>
To illustrate this strange statement, Heisenbeig proposed<br>
that we imagine a super microscope of extraordinarily high<br>resolving power—powerful enough, in fact, to be able to see<br>an electron moving around in its orbit Since elections are so<br>small we cannot use ordinary light in our microscope because<br>the wavelength of<br>
 light is much too long to see '<br>

electrons, in the same way that long sea waves barely are<br>influenced by a thin pole sticking out of the water<br>
If we hold a strand of<br>
 between a bright light and the<br>
wall, the hair casts no distinct shadow It is so thin compared<br>to the wavelengths of the light that the light waves bend<br>around it instead of being obstructed by it To see something,<br>we have to obstruct the light waves we are looking with In<br>other words, to see something, we have to illuminate it with<br>
wavelengths smaller than it is For this reason, Heisenberg<br>
substituted gamma rays for visible light in his imaginary mi-<br>croscope Gamma rays have the shortest wavelength known,<br>
which is just what we need for seeing an electron An electron<br>
is large enough, compared to the tiny wavelength of gamma<br>rays, to obstruct some of them to make a shadow on the wall,<br>as it were This enables us to locate the electron<br>
The only problem and this is where quantum phvsics enters<br>
the picture, is that, according to Planck s discovery, gamma<br>rays which have a much shorter wavelength than visible light,<br>also contain much more energy than visible light When a<br>gamma ray strikes the imaginary electron, it illuminates the<br>electron, but unfortunately, it also knocks it out of its orbit<br>
and changes its direction and speed (its momentum) in an<br>unpredictable and uncontrollable way (We cannot calculate<br>precisely the angle of rebound between a particle, like the<br>electron, and a wave, like the gamma ray) In short, if we<br>use light with a wavelength short enough to locate the elec-<br>tron, we cause an undertermmable change in the electron's<br>momentum<br>
The only alternatne is to use a less energetic light Less<br>
energetic light, however, causes our original problem Light<br>
with an energy low enough not to disturb the momentum of<br>the electron will have a wavelength so long that it will not be<br>able to show us where the electron is' There is no way that we<br>can know simultaneously the position<i> and</i> the momentum of a<br>moving particle All attempts to observe the electron alter the<br>electron<br>
This is the primary significance of the uncertainty principle<br>
At the subatomic level,<i> we cannot observe something without</i><br>
<i> it</i> There is no such thing as the independent ob-<br>
server who can stand on the sidelines watching nature run its<br>course without influencing it<br>
In one sense, this is not such a surprising statement A<br>

good way to make a stranger turn and look at you is to stare<br>intently at his back All of us know this, but we often discredit<br>what we know when it contradicts what we have been taught<br>is possible Classical physics is based on the assumption that<br>our realitv, independently of us, runs its course in space and<br>time according to strict causal laws Not only can we observe<br>it, unnoticed, as it unfolds, we can predict its future by apply-<br>ing causal laws to initial conditions In this sense, Heisenberg's<br>uncertainty principle is a<i> very</i> supnsing statement<br>
We cannot apply Newton s laws of motion to an individual<br>
particle that does not have an initial location and momentum,<br>which is exactly what the uncertainty principle shows us that<br>we cannot determine In other words, it is impossible, even<br>in principle, ever to know enough about a particle in the<br>subatomic realm to apply Newton s laws of motion which, for<br>three centuries, were the basis of ph&gt; sics<i> Newton s laws do<br>not apply to the subatomic realm *</i> (Newton s<i> concepts</i> do not<br>even apply in the subatomic realm) Given a beam of electrons,<br>quantum theory can predict the probable distribution of the<br>electrons over a given space at a given time, but quantum<br>theory cannot predict even in principle, the course of a single<br>electron The whole idea of a causal universe is undermined<br>
by the uncertainty principle<br>
In a related context, Niels Bohr wrote that quantum me-<br>
chanics, by its essence, entails<br>
the necessity of a final renunciation of the classical<br>
ideal of causality and a radical revision of our attitude<br>toward the problem of physical reality 9<br>
Yet there is another startling implication in the uncertainty<br>
principle The concepts of position and momentum are<br>intimately bound up with our idea of a thing called a moving<br>
particle If, as it turns out we cannot determine the position<br>and momentum of a moving particle, as we always have<br>assumed that we could, then we are forced to admit that this<br>thing that we have been calling a moving particle whatever it<br>is, is<i> not</i> the &quot;moving particle&quot; we thought it was, because<br>
* Strictly speaking Newton s laws do not disappeai totally in the subatomic<br>realm thev remain valid as operator equations Also in some experiments<br>invoKing subatomic particles Newton s laws may be taken as good approxima<br>tions in the description of what is happening<br>

<A name=133></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-133_1.png"><br>
<b>114 /MY WAY</b><br>
&quot;moving particles&quot; always have both position and momentum.<br>
As Max Born put it:<br>
. . . if we can never actually determine more than one of<br>
the two properties (possession of a definite position and<br>of a definite momentum), and if when one is determined<br>we-can make no assertion at all about the other property<br>for the same moment, so far as our experiment goes,<br>then we are not justified in concluding that the &quot;thing&quot;<br>under examination can actually be described as a particle<br>in the usual sense of the term.10<br>
Whatever it is that we are observing<i> can</i> have a determinable<br>
momentum, and it<i> can</i> have a determinable position, but of<br>these two properties,<i> we must choose,</i> for any given moment,<br>
which one we wish to bring into focus. This means, in reference<br>
to 'moving particles anyway, that we can never see them the<br>way they &quot;really are,&quot; but only the way we choose to see<br>them!<br>
As Heisenberg wrote:<br>
What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed<br>to our method of questioning.u<br>
The uncertainty principle rigorously brings us to the<br>
realization that there is no &quot;My Way&quot; which is separate from<br>the world around us. It brings into question the very existence<br>
of an &quot;objective&quot; reality, as does complementarity and the<br>concept of particles as correlations.<br>
The tables have been turned. &quot;The exact sciences&quot; no longer<br>
study an objective reality that runs its course regardless of our<br>interest in it or not, leaving us to fare as best we can while it<br>
goes its predetermined way. Science, at the level of subatomic<br>events, is no longer &quot;exact,&quot; the distinction between objective<br>and subjective has vanished, and the portals through which<br>the universe manifests itself are, as we once knew a long time<br>ago, those impotent, passive witnesses to its unfolding, the<br>&quot;I&quot;s, of which we, insignificant we, are examples. The Cogs in<br>the Machine have become the Creators of the Universe.<br>
If the new physics has led us anywhere, it is back to our-<br>
selves, which, of course, is the only place that we could go.<br>

CHAPTER<br>
1<br>
Beginner's Mind<br>
The importance of nonsense hardly can be overstated. The<br>more clearly we experience something as &quot;nonsense,&quot; the more<br>clearly we are experiencing the boundaries of our own self-<br>
|imposed cognitive structures. &quot;Nonsense&quot; is that which does<br>
not fit into the prearranged patterns which we have super-<br>
|imposed on reality. There is no such thing as &quot;nonsense&quot;<br>
apart from a judgmental intellect which calls it that.<br>
True artists and true physicists know that nonsense is only<br>
Ithat which, viewed from our present point of view, is unintel-<br>|ligible. Nonsense is nonsense only when we have not yet<br>
ound that point of view from which it makes sense.<br>
In general, physicists do not deal in nonsense. Most of<br>
|them spend their professional lives thinking along well-<br>
established lines of thought. Those scientists who establish the<br>established lines of thought, however, are those who do not<br>
pear to venture boldly into nonsense, into that which any fool<br>
ould have told them is clearly not so. This is the mark of the<br>
creative mind, in fact, this is the creative process. It ischarac-<br>
 by a steadfast confidence that there exists a point of<br>
view from which the &quot;nonsense&quot; is not nonsense at all—in<br>
act, from which it is obvious.<br>
In physics, as elsewhere, those who most have felt the<br>
exhilaration of the creative process are those who best have<br>
 the bonds of the known to venture far into the<br>
 territory which lies beyond the barrier of the ob-<br>
Ivious. This type of person has two characteristics. The first is<br>
childlike ability to see the world as it is, and not as it<br>

appears according to what we know about it. This is the moral<br>of the (child's?) tale, &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes.&quot; When<br>the emperor rode naked through the streets, only a child<br>proclaimed him to be without clothes, while the rest of his<br>subjects forced themselves to believe, because they had been<br>told so, that he wore his finest new clothing.<br>
Th'e child in us is always naive, innocent in the simplistic<br>
sense. A Zen story tells of Nan-in, a Japanese master during<br>the Meiji era who received a university professor. The professor<br>came to inquire about Zen. Nan-in served tea. He poured his<br>visitor's cup full, and then kept on pouring. The professor<br>watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain him-<br>self.<br>
&quot;It is overfull. No more will go in!&quot;<br>&quot;Like this cup,&quot; Nan-in said, &quot;you are full of your own<br>
opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless<br>you first empty your cup?&quot;<br>
<i>Our</i> cup usually is filled to the brim with &quot;the obvious,&quot;<br>
&quot;common sense,&quot; and &quot;the self-evident.&quot;<br>
Suzuki Roshi, who established the first Zen center in the<br>
United States (without trying, of course, which is very Zen),<br>told his students that it is not difficult to attain enlightenment,<br>but it is difficult to keep a beginner's mind. &quot;In the beginner's<br>mind,&quot; he told them, &quot;there are many possibilities, but in the<br>
expert's there are few.&quot; When his students published Suzuki's<br>talks after his death, they called the book, appropriately,<i> Zen<br>Mind, Beginner's Mind.</i> In the introduction, Baker Roshi, the<br>American Zen Master, wrote:<br>
The mind of the beginner is empty, free of the habits of<br>the expert, ready to accept, to doubt, and open to all the<br>possibilities. . .<br>
The beginner's mind in science is wonderfully illustrated by<br>
the story of Albert Einstein and his theory of relativity. That<br>is the subject of this chapter.<br>
The second characteristic of true artists and true scientists<br>
is the firm confidence which both of them have in themselves.<br>This confidence is an expression of an inner strength which<br>allows them to speak out, secure in the knowledge that, ap-<br>pearances to the contrary, it is the world that is confused and<br>not they. The first man to see an illusion by which men have<br>flourished for centuries surely stands in a lonely place. In that<br>

moment of insight he, and he alone, sees the obvious which<br>to the uninitiated (the rest of the world) yet appears as non-<br>sense or, worse, as madness or heresy. This confidence is not<br>the obstinacy of the fool, but the surety of him who knows<br>what he knows, and knows also that he can convey it to others<br>
in a meaningful way.<br>
The writer, Henry Miller, wrote:<br>
1 obey only my own instincts and intuition. I know nothing<br>in advance. Often I put down things which I do not<br>
understand myself, secure in the knowledge that later<br>they will become clear and meaningful to me. I have<br>faith in the man who is writing, who is myself, the writer.2<br>
The song-writer, Bob Dylan, told a press conference:<br>
I just write a song and I know it's going to be all right. I<br>don't even know what it's going to say<br>
An example of this kind of faith in the realm of physics was<br>
the theory of light quanta. In 1905, the accepted and proven<br>theory of light was that light was a wave phenomenon. In<br>spite of this, Einstein published his famous paper proposing<br>that light was a particle phenomenon (page 52). Heisenberg<br>described this fascinating situation this way:<br>
[In 1905] light could either be interpreted as consisting of<br>electromagnetic waves, according to Maxwell's theory, or<br>as consisting of light quanta, energy packets traveling<br>
through space with high velocity [according to Einstein].<br>But could it be both? Einstein knew, of course, that the<br>well-known phenomena of diffraction and interference can<br>be explained only on the basis of the wave picture. He<br>was not able to dispute the complete contradiction be-<br>tween this wave picture and the idea of the light quanta;<br>nor did he even attempt to remove the inconsistency of<br>this interpretation. He simply took the contradiction as<br>something which would probably be understood much<br>later.4<br>
That is exactly what happened. Einstein's thesis led to the<br>
wave-particle duality from which quantum mechanics emerged,<br>and with it, as we know, a way of looking at reality and<br>ourselves that is vastly different from that to which we were<br>accustomed. Although Einstein is known popularly for his<br>

theones of relativity, it was his paper on the quantum nature<br>of light that won him the Nobel Prize It is also a fine example<br>of confidence in nonsense<br>
What is nonsense and what is not, then, may be merely a<br>
matter of perspective<br>
' Wait a minute, interrupts Jim de Wit My uncle Weird<br>
George, believes that he is a football Of course, we know<br>that this is nonsense, but Uncle George thinks that<i> we</i> are<br>mad He is quite certain that he is a football He talks about it<br>constantly In other words, he has abundant confidence in his<br>nonsense Does this make him a great<br>
No In fact, Weird George has a problem Not only is he<br>
the only person who has this particular perspective, but also<br>this particular perspective is in no way relative to that of any<br>other observer, which brings us to the heart of Einstein's<br>special theory of relativity (Einstein created two theones of<br>relativity The first theory is called the special theory of<br>
 The second theory which came later and is more<br>
general, is called the general theory of relativity This chapter<br>and the next are about the first theory the special theory of<br>relativity)<br>
The special theory of relativity is not so much about what is<br>
relative as about what is not It describes in what way the<br>relative aspects of physical reahtv appear to vary depending<br>upon the point of view of different observers (actually depending<br>upon their state of motion relative to each other) but, in the<br>process, it defines the non-changing, absolute aspect of physi-<br>cal reality as well<br>
The special theory of relativity is not a theory that everything<br>
is relative It is a theory that<i> appearances</i> are relative What<br>may appear to us as a ruler (physicists sav rod ) one foot<br>long, may appear to an observer traveling past us (very fast) as<br>being only ten inches long What may appear to us as one<br>hour, may appear to an observer traveling past us (very fast)<br>as two hours However, the moving observer can use the<br>special theory of relativity to determine how our ruler and our<br>
clock appear to us (if he knows his motion relative to us) and,<br>likewise, we can use the special theory of relativity to deter-<br>mine how our stick and our clock appear to the moving ob-<br>server (if we know our motion relative to him)<br>
If we were to perform an experiment at the same moment<br>
that the moving observer came past us both we and the<br>
<hr>
<A name=139></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-139_1.png"><br>
BEGINNER'S MIND / 121<br>
moving observer would see the same experiment but each of<br>us would record different times and distances, we with our<br>rod and clock and he with his rod and clock Using the special<br>theory of relativity however, each of us could transpose our<br>data to the other s frame of reference The final numbers<br>would come out the same for both of us In essence the<br>special theory of relativity is not about what is relative, it is<br>about what is absolute<br>
However, the special theory of relativity does show that<br>
appearances are dependent upon the state of motion of the<br>observers For example the special theory of relativity tells<br>us that (1) a moving object measures shorter in its direction of<br>motion as its velocity increases until, at the speed of light it<br>disappears (2) the mass of a moving object measures more as<br>its velocity increases until at the speed of light it becomes<br>infinite and (3) moving clocks run more slowly as their velocity<br>increases until at the speed of light they stop running alto-<br>gether<br>
All of this is from the point of view of an observer to whom<br>
the object is moving To an observer traveling along with the<br>moving object, the clock keeps perfect time ticking off sixtv<br>seconds each minute and nothing appears to get any shorter<br>or more massive The special theory of relativity also tells us<br>that space and time are not two separate things but that<br>together they form space-time and that energy and mass are<br>
actually different forms of the same thing mass-energv<br>
This is not possible' we crv It is nonsense to think that<br>
increasing the velocity of an object increases its mass de-<br>creases its length and slows its time<br>
Our cup runneth over<br>These phenomena are not observable in everyday life be-<br>
cause the velocities required to make them noticeable are<br>those approaching the speed of light (186 000 miles per<i> second)<br></i>At the slow speeds that we encounter in the macroscopic<br>world, these effects are virtually undetectable If they were,<br>we would discover that a car traveling down the freeway is<br>shorter than it is at rest, weighs more than it does at rest<br>and that its clock runs slower than it does at rest In fact we<br>even would find that a hot iron weighs more than a cold one<br>(because energy has mass and heat is energy)<br>
How Einstein discovered all of this is another version of<br>

Only Albert Einstein looked at two of the major puzzles of<br>
his day and saw them with a beginner's mind The result was<br>the special theory of relativity The first puzzle of Einstein's<br>time was the constancy of the speed of light The second<br>puzzle of Einstein's time was the uncertainty, both physical<br>and philosophical, about what it means to be moving or not<br>moving *<br>
'Wait a minute,&quot; we say &quot;What is uncertain about that11 If<br>
I am sitting in a chair and another person walks past me, then<br>the person walking past me is in motion, and I, sitting in my<br>
chair, am not in motion &quot;<br>
&quot;Quile right,' says Jim de Wit, appearing on cue, &quot;but still,<br>
it is not that simple Suppose that the chair in which vou are<br>sitting is on an airplane and that the person walking past you is<br>a stewardess Suppose also that I am on the ground watching<br>
both of you go by From your point of view, vou are at rest<br>and the stewardess is in motion, but from my point of view, I<br>am at rest and<i> both</i> of you are in motion It all depends upon<br>your frame of reference Your frame of reference is the air-<br>plane, but my frame of reference is the earth<br>
De Wit, as usual, has discovered the problem exactly<br>
Unfortunately, he has not solved it The earth itself hardly is<br>standing still Not only is it spinning on its axis like a top, it<br>and the moon are revolving around a common center of grav-<br>
ity while both of them circle the sun at eighteen miles per<br>second<br>
'That's not fair,&quot; we say &quot;Of course, it is true, but the<br>
earth does not seem to be moving to us who live on it It is<br>only in motion if we change our frame of reference from it to<br>the sun If we start playing that game, it is impossible to find<br>anything in the entire universe that is 'standing still From<br>the point of view of the galaxy, the sun is moving, from the<br>point of view of another galaxy, our galaxy is moving, from the<br>
point of view of a third galaxy, the fii st two galaxies are mov-<br>ing In fact, from the point of view of each of them, the others<br>are moving &quot;<br>

point There is no such thing as something being absolutely at<br>rest, unequivocally not moving Motion, and the lack of it, is<br>always relative to something else Whether we are moving or<br>not depends upon what frame of reference we use<br>
The discussion above is<i> not</i> the special theorv of relativity<br>
In fact, the discussion above is a part of the Galilean relativity<br>
principle which is over three hundred years old Any physical<br>theory is a theory of relativity if, like Jim de Wit, it acknowl-<br>edges the difficulty of detecting absolute motion or absolute<br>non-motion A theory of relativity assumes that the only kind<br>of motion that we ever can determine is motion, or lack of it,<br>relative to something else Galileo s principle of relativity says,<br>in addition, that the laws of mechanics are<br>
 \alid in all<br>
frames of reference (physicists sav ' co-ordinate systems&quot;) that<br>move uniformly in relation to each other<br>
The Galilean relativity principle assumes that somewhere<br>
in the universe there exists a frame of reference in which the<br>laws of mechanics are completely valid—that is, a frame of<br>reference in which experiment and theory agree perfectly<br>
This frame of reference is called an 'mertial frame of reference<br>An mertial frame of reference simply means a frame of reference<br>
in which the laws of mechanics are completely valid All other<br>
frames of reference moving uniformly, relative to an mertial<br>frame of reference, are also mertial frames of reference Since<br>the laws of mechanics are equally valid in all mertial frames of<br>reference, this means that there is no wav that we can<br>distinguish between one mertial frame of reference and an-<br>other by performing mechanical experiments in them<br>
Frames of reference moving uniformly, relative to each other,<br>
are co-ordinate systems that move with a constant speed and<br>direction In other words, they are frames of reference that<br>move with a constant velocitv For example, if, by accident,<br>we drop a book while standing in line at the library, the book<br>falls directly downward in accordance with Newton's law of<br>gravity, and strikes the ground directly beneath the place<br>from which it was dropped Our frame of reference is the<br>earth The earth is moving at a fantastic speed on its trip<br>around the sun, but this speed is constant *<br>

same thing happens The book falls directly downward in ac-<br>cordance with Newton s laws of gravitation and stnkes the<br>floor of the train directly beneath the place from which it was<br>
dropped This time, our frame of reference is the train Be-<br>cause the train is moving uniformly, with no increases or<br>decreases of speed, in relation to the earth and because the<br>earth is moving in a similar manner in relation to the train,<br>the two frames of reference are moving uniformly relative to<br>each other and the laws of mechanics are valid in both of<br>them It does not matter in the least which of the frames of<br>reference is moving ' A person in either frame of reference<br>can consider himself moving and the other frame of reference<br>at rest (the earth is at rest and the train is moving) or the<br>other way round (the tram is at rest and the earth is moving)<br>From the point of view of phvsics, there is no difference<br>
What happens if the engineer suddenly accelerates while<br>

 Then of course, everything is<br>
upset The falling book still will strike the floor of the tram,<br>but at a spot farther back since the floor of the tram has<br>moved forward beneath the book while it was falling In this<br>
case the tram is not moving uniformly in relation to the<br>earth and the Galilean relativity principle does not apply<br>
Provided that all of the motion involved is uniformh rela-<br>
tive, we can translate motion as perceived in one frame of<br>reference into another frame of reference For example suppose<br>that we are standing on the shore watching a ship move past<br>us at<br>
 miles per hour The ship is a frame of reference<br>
moving uniformh relative to us There is a passenger a man,<br>standing on the deck of the ship, leaning against the railing<br>Since he is standing still his velocity is the same as that of the<br>ship, thirty miles per hour (From his point of view we are<br>moving past<i> him</i> at<br>
 miles per hour)<br>
Suppose now that the man begins to walk toward the front<br>
of the ship at three miles per hour His velocity now, relative<br>to us, is<br>
 miles per hour The ship carries him<br>
forward at thirty miles per hour and his walking adds three<br>
miles per hour to that (You get to the top of an escalator<br>
faster if you walk)<br>
Suppose that the man turns around and walks back toward<br>
the rear of the ship His velocity relative to the ship is, again<br>three miles per hour, but his velocity relative to the shore is<br>now twentv-seven miles per hour<br>

relative to us we add his velocity to the<br>
 of his co-<br>
ordinate system (the ship) if he is walking in the same direction<br>that it is moving and we subtract his<br>
 from the velocity<br>
of his co-ordinate svstem if he is walking in the opposite direc-<br>tion This calculation is called a classical (Galilean) transfor-<br>mation Knowing the uniform relative motion of our two frames<br>of reference we can transform the passenger s velocity in<br>reference to his own co-ordinate svstem (three miles per hour)<br>into his velocity in reference to our co-ordinate system (thirty-<br>three miles per hour)<br>
The freeway provides abundant examples of classical trans-<br>
formations from one frame of reference to another Suppose<br>that we are driving at 75 miles per hour We see a truck<br>coming toward us Its speedometer also reads 75 miles per<br>hour Making a classical transformation, we can say that, rela-<br>tive to us the truck is approaching at 150 miles per hour,<br>
which explains why head-on collisions so often are fatal<br>
Suppose now that a car going in the same direction that we<br>
are going passes us His speedometer reads 110 miles per<br>hour (it s a Ferrari) Again, making a classical transformation<br>we can say that relative to us the Ferrari is departing our<br>location at 35 miles per hour<br>
The transformation laws of classical mechanics are common<br>
sense They say that ven though we cannot determine<br>
whether a frame of reference is absolutely at rest or not we<br>can translate velocities (and positions) from one frame of<br>reference into velocities (and positions) in other fiames of<br>reference provided that the frames of rt ference are moving<br>uniformly, relative to each other Furthermore, the Galilean<br>relativity principle, from which Galilean transformations come<br>says that if the laws of mechanics are valid in any one frame of<br>reference they also are valid in any other frame of reference<br>moving uniformly relative to it<br>

The earth is nof an mertial frame of reference Since their<br>very inception, the poor laws of classical mechanics have been<br>left, so to speak, without a home No one has discovered a<br>co-ordinate sy stem in which they manifest themselves perfectly<br>
This leaves us, from a ph&gt; sicist s point of view, in a pretty<br>
mess On the one hand, we have the laws of classical mechan-<br>ics, which arc indispensable to phvsics, and on the other<br>hand, these same laws are predicated upon a co-ordinate system<br>
which mav not even exist<br>
This problem is related to relativity, which is the problem<br>
of determining absolute non-motion, in an intimate way If<br>such a thing as absolute non-motion were detected, then a<br>co-ordinate system attached to it would be the long-lost mertial<br>fiame of reference, the co-ordinate system in which the clas-<br>sical laws of mechanics are perfectly valid Then everything<br>would make sense again because, given a frame of reference<br>in which the classical laws of mechanics are valid,<i> any</i> frame<br>
of reference the classical laws of met hanics at last would have<br>a permanent mailing address<br>
Phvsidsts do not enjoy theories with loose ends Before<br>
Einstein, the problem of detecting absolute motion (or abso-<br>lute non-motion—if we find one, we find the other), and the<br>
problem of finding an mertial co-ordinate system were, to say<br>the least, loose ends The entire structure of classical mechan-<br>ics was based on the fact that somewhere, somehow, there<br>must be a frame of reference in which the laws of classical<br>mechanics are v alid The inability of phvsicists to find it made<br>classical mechanics appear<br>
 like a huge castle built on<br>

In the course of their experiments with the speed of light,<br>
physicists discovered something very strange The speed of<br>light disregards the transformation laws of classical mechanics<br>Of course, that's impossible, but<br>
 experiment<br>
after experiment proved just the opposite The speed of light<br>
just happens to be the most nonsensical thing ever discovered<br>
That is because it never changes<br>
'So light<br>
 travels at the same speed,&quot; we ask, \vhat s<br>
so strange about thatl&gt;&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh mv, oh my, ' says a distraught phvsicist circa 1887<br>
&quot;you simply don't understand the problem The problem is<br>that no matter what the circumstances of the measurement,<br>no matter what the motion of the observ er, the speed of light<br><i>always</i> measures 186,000 miles per second ' *<br>
&quot;Is this bad?&quot; we sav, beginning to sense that something is<br>
strange here<br>
&quot;Worse,&quot; says the physicist &quot;It's impossible Look,&quot; he<br>
tells us, trying to calm himself, &quot;suppose that we are standing<br>still and that somewhere in front of us is a light bulb that also<br>is standing still The light bulb flashes on and off and we<br>measure the velocity of the light that comes from it What do<br>you suppose that<br>
 \vill be?&quot;<br>
&quot;186,000 miles per second, we answer, &quot;the speed of light<br>&quot;Correct'&quot; savs the physicist, with a knowing look that makes<br>
us uncomfortable &quot;Now, suppose the light bulb still is standing<br>still, but we are moving toward it at 100,000 miles per second<br>Now what will we measure the speed of the light<br>
286,000 miles per second,' we answer ' the speed of light<br>
(186,000 miles per second) plus our speed (100 OXX) miles per<br>second) &quot; (This is a typical example of a classical transformation)<br>
&quot;Wrong1&quot; shouts the physicist &quot;That's just the point<i> The</i><br>

When the photons are emitted,<br>they are traveling at 186,000 miles per second. If we also are<br>moving, and moving toward them, their velocity should meas-<br>ure that much faster. In fact, they should appear to be traveling<br>with the speed at which they were emitted<i> plus</i> our speed.<br>Their velocity should measure 186,000 miles per second plus<br>
100,000 miles per second.&quot;<br>
&quot;True,&quot; says our friend, &quot;but it doesn't. It measures 186,000<br>
miles per second, just as if we still were standing still.&quot;<br>
Pausing for that to sink in, he continues, &quot;Now consider the<br>
opposite situation. Suppose that the light bulb still is standing<br>still, and this time we are moving<i> away</i> from it at 100,000<br>miles per second. What will the velocity of the photons meas-<br>ure now?<br>
&quot;86,000 miles per second?&quot; we say, hopefully, &quot;the speed of<br>
light minus our speed as we move away from the approaching<br>photons?&quot;<br>
&quot;Wrong, again!&quot; exclaims our friend again. &quot;It should, but<br>
it doesn't. The speed of the photons still measures 186,000<br>miles per second.&quot;<br>
&quot;This is very hard to believe. Do you mean that if a light<br>
bulb is at rest and we measure the speed of the photons<br>emitted from it while we also are at rest, and if we then<br>measure the speed of the photons from it while we are mov-<br>ing toward it, and lastly, if we measure the speed of the<br>photons emitted from it while we are moving away from it,<br>we get<i> the same result</i> in all three cases?&quot;<br>
&quot;Exactly!&quot; says the physicist. &quot;186,000 miles per second.&quot;*<br>&quot;Do you have any evidence?&quot; we ask him.<br>
Unfortunately, he says, &quot;I do. Two American<br>
Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, have just completed<br>an experiment which seems to show that the speed of light is<br>constant, regardless of the state of motion of the observer.&quot;<br>
* The reverse situation (the source moves and the observer remains<br>is explainable in terms of pre-relativistic physics. In fact, if<br>
 is assumed to<br>
be a wave phenomenon<br>
 by a wave equation, it is<i> expected</i> that its<br>
measured velocity will be independent of the velocity of its source. The velocity<br>of the sound waves reaching us from a jet plane, for example, does not depend<br>upon the velocity of the aircraft. They propagate through a medium (the<br>atmosphere) at a given velocity, from their point of origin, regardless of the<br>motion of the plane (the<br>

&quot;This can't happen,&quot; he sighs, &quot;but it is happening. It just<br>
doesn't make sense.&quot;<br>
The problem of absolute non-motion and the problem of<br>
the constancy of the speed of light converged in the Michel-<br>
son-Morley experiment. The Michelson-Morley experiment<br>(1887) was a crucial experiment. A crucial experiment is an<br>experiment which determines the life or death of a scientific<br>theory. The theory that was tested by the Michelson-Morley<br>experiment was the theory of the ether.<br>
The theory of the ether was that the entire universe lies in<br>
and is permeated by an invisible, tasteless, odorless substance<br>that has no properties at all, and exists simply because it has<br>to exist so that light waves can have something to propagate<br>in. For light to travel as waves, according to the theory,<br>something has to be waving. That something was the ether.<br>
The theory of the ether was the last attempt to explain the<br>universe by explaining<br>
 Interpreting the universe<br>
in terms of things (like the Great Machine idea) was the<br>distinguishing characteristic of the mechanical view, which<br>
means all of physics from Newton until the middle 1800s.<br>
The ether, according to the theory, is everywhere and in<br>
everything. We live and perform our experiments in a sea of<br>ether. To the ether, the hardest substance is as porous as a<br>sponge to water. There are no doors to the ether. Although<br>
we move in the ether sea, the ether sea does not move. It is<br>
absolutely, unequivocally not moving.<br>
Therefore, although the primary reason for the existence of<br>
the ether was to give light something to propagate through,<br>its existence also solved the old problem of locating the origi-<br>nal inertial co-ordinate system, that frame of reference in which<br>the laws of mechanics are completely valid. If the ether existed<br>
(and it<i> had</i> to exist), the co-ordinate system attached to it was<br><i>the</i> co-ordinate system against which all others could be com-<br>pared to see if they were moving or not.<br>
The findings of Michelson and Morley gave a verdict of<br>
e.g., the Doppler effect). Pre-relativity theory assumes a medium (like the<br>atmosphere, for sound<br>
 or the ether, for light waves) through which the<br>
waves propagate. The paradox is that the measured velocity of light has been<br>found (the Michelsou-Morley experiment) to be independent of the motion of<br>the observer. In other words, assuming a light wave propagating through a<br>medium, how can we move through the same medium toward the approaching<br>wave without<br>
 its measured velocity?<br>

death to the theory of the ether * Equally important, they led<br>to the mathematical foundations of Einstein s revolutionary<br>new theory<br>
The idea of the Michelson-Morley experiment was to de-<br>
termine the motion of the earth through the ether sea The<br>problem was how to do this Two ships at sea can determine<br>their motion relative to one another, but if only one ship<br>moves through a smooth sea, it has no reference point against<br>
which to measure its progress In the old days, seamen would<br>throw a log overboard, and measure their progress relative to<br>it Michelson and Morley did the same thing, except that the<br>log that they threw overboard was a beam of light<br>
Their experiment was conceptually simple and ingenious If<br>
the earth is moving thev reasoned, and the ether sea is at<br>rest, then the movement of the earth through the ether sea<br>must cause an ether<br>
 Therefore, a beam of light traveling<br>
against the ether breeze should have a slower velocity than a<br>beam of light sent across the ether breeze This is the essence<br>of the Michelson-Morlev experiment<br>
Every pilot knows that it takes longer to fly a given distance<br>
if one leg of the trip is against a head wind (even though the<br>return leg is with a tail wind) than it takes to fly the same<br>
distance across the same wind Similarly, thought Michelson<br>and Morley, if the theory of the ether sea is correct, a light<br>beam sent upstream against the ether breeze and then<br>downstream with it will take longer to return to its starting<br>point than a light beam sent back and forth across the either<br>
To establish and detect this difference in velocity, Michelson<br>
and Morley created a device called an interferometer (from<br>the word, ' interference ) It was designed to detect the inter-<br>ference pattern created by the two beams of light as they<br>returned to a common point<br>
A light source emits a beam of light toward a half-silvered<br>
mirror (similar to the lenses in sunglasses that look like a<br>mirror on one side, but are transparent from the other side )<br>
The original beam of light ( ~  ~ ~ ~ &gt;) is split by the half-<br>
silvered mirror into two segments<br>
 ( - - - -<br>
 each<br>
of which travels an equal distance, but at right angles to each<br>

other, and back again The two beams then reunite via the same<br>half-silvered mirror and travel (  - - - - &gt; ) into a measuring<br>device By<br>
 the interference created by these con-<br>
verging beams in the measuring device, any difference in<br>velocity between them can be determined accurately<br>
When the experiment was performed, not the slightest dif-<br>
ference in<br>
 could be detected between the two beams<br>
of light The interferometer was turned 90 degrees so that the<br>beam going against the ether wind now was directed across it,<br>and the beam going across the ether wind now was sent directly<br>into it Again not the slightest difference in velocity between<br>the two beams could be detected<br>
In other words, the Michelson-Morley experiment had failed<br>
to prove the existence of the ether Unless an explanation<br>
could be found, physicists would be faced with choosing be-<br>
tween two unsettling alternatives either (1) the earth is not<br>moving (and Copernicus was wrong), or (2) the ether does not<br>
exist Neither of these was verv acceptable<br>
Michelson and Morley thought that perhaps the earth car-<br>

ried a layer of ether with it as it moved through the ether set,<br>
just as it carries its atmosphere with it as it travels through<br>
space and, therefore, close to the surface of the earth, the<br>ether breeze cannot be detected No one had a better hypoth-<br>esis until an Irishman named George Francis FitzGerald<br>proposed (in 1892) an outrageous explanation<br>
FitzGerald reasoned that perhaps the pressure of the ether<br>
wind compresses matter just as an elastic object moving through<br>water becomes shortened in the direction that it is traveling<br>
If this were true, then the arm of the interferometer pointing<br>into the ether wind would be somewhat shorter than the arm<br>that is not pointing into it Therefore, a reduction in the<br>
velocity of the light traveling into the ether wind and back<br>might not be detected because the distance that the light<br>travels also is reduced In fact, if the amount by which the<br>interferometer arm pointing into the ether wind is shortened<br>
just corresponds to the amount by which the velocity of the<br>
light traveling up that arm and back is reduced, then both<br>beams of light in the experiment will reach the measuring<br>device at exactly the same time (the beam with the higher<br>velocity traversing a greater distance in the same time that<br>the beam with the slower velocity traverses a lesser distance)<br>
FitzGerald's hypothesis had a major advantage over all the<br>
others It was impossible to disprove It said simplv that there<br>is a one-dimensional contraction (in the direction of motion)<br>that increases as velocity increases The catch is that<i> everything<br></i>contracts If we want to measure the length of an object that<br>is moving very fast compared to the speed of light, we have to<br>catch up with it first, and when we do, according to the<br>theory, the measuring stick that we are carrying with us also<br>contracts If the object measured seventeen inches at rest, it<br>still would measure seventeen inches Nor would anything<br>look contracted because the lenses in our eyes also would<br>contract, distorting them just enough to make everything look<br>normal<br>
One year later a Dutch physicist, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz,<br>
while working on another problem, independently arrived at<br>
FitzGerald's hypothesis Lorentz, however, expressed his<br>
discovery in rigorous mathematical terms This, of course,<br>upgraded FitzGerald's hypothesis to a position of respectability<br>and it began to gain a surprising degree of acceptance,<br>

In one stroke, Einstein eliminated the two major physical<br>

Einstein's next step was to confront the puzzle which had<br>
come to light (no pun) in the Michelson-Morlev experiment,<br>namely, the constancy of the speed of light How could the<br>
speed of light<br>

In an ingenious mental turnaround, Einstein turned this<br>

light is invariably 186 000 miles per second * This is what<br>Michelson and Morley discovered in their famous experiment<br>
From the point of view of classical mechanics the principle<br>
of the constancy of the velocity of light makes no sense at all<br>In fact it conflicts violently with common sense Before<br>Einstein, the totalitarian grasp of common sense held the<br>constancy of the speed of light to the status of a paradox<br>(Whenever we bump into the limits of our self-imposed cogni-<br>tive reality, the result is always paradox) It took a pure<br>beginner s mind, such as Albert Einstein s to accept that if<br>what is, is (the constancy of the<br>
 of light), then<i> common</i><br>
<i> be</i><br>
The most important victim of Einstein s beginner s mind<br>
was the whole structure of classical (Galilean) transformations,<br>that sweet but illusory fiuit of a common sense anchored in<br>macroscopic dimensions and velocities To give up common<br>sense is not an easy task Einstein was the first person to do it<br>in such a wholesale manner that his perception of the very<br>nature of space and time changed ladically Moreover, when<br>all was said and done, Einstein s vision of space and time<br>turned out to be more useful than that of common sense<br>
The second foundation stone of the special theory of relativity<br>
is the principle of relativity When Einstein dismissed the<br>idea of absolute non-motion his theory became<br>
<i> facto,</i> a<br>
theory of relativity Since there was no better principle of<br>relativity to be had than Galileo s Einstein snnplv borrowed<br>it, but first of course, he brought it up to date<br>
Galileo s principle of relativity savs that the laws of mechan-<br>
ics (such as the laws governing falling bodies) that are valid in<br>one frame of reference are valid in all frames of reference that<br>move uniformly (without jerkmess) in relation to it Another<br>way of<br>
 ing the same thing is that it is impossible to deter-<br>
mine, by doing experiments involving the laws of mechanics,<br>whether or not our frame of reference is moving or at rest in<br>relation to another frame of reference in which the laws of<br>mechanics also are valid<br>

electromagnetic radiation which were unknown in Galileo's<br>time<br>
Einstein s updated principle of relativity then, is that all<br>
the laws of nature are exactly identical in all frames of references<br>that move uniformly relative to each other and that therefore,<br>there is no way of distinguishing absolute uniform motion (or<br>non-motion)<br>
In short, the two foundation stones of the special theory of<br>
relativity are the principle of the<br>
 of the velocity of<br>
light (the Michelson-Morley experiment) and the principle of<br>relativity (Galileo) Said more specifically, the special theory<br>of relativity rests upon these two postulates<br>
(1) The velocity of light in a vacuum is the same in all<br>
frames of reference (for all observers) moving uniformly, rela-<br>
tive to each other, and<br>
(2) All laws of nature are the same in all frames of reference<br>
moving uniformly, relative to each other<br>
Of these two postulates, the first one the principle of the<br>
constancy of the velocity of light is the troublemaker There<br>is no way that it and the classical transformation laws both can<br>be true According to the classical transformation laws (and<br>common sense) the speed of light must be its velocity as it is<br>emitted from a source plus or minus the velocity of the ob-<br>server, if the observer is moving toward the source or away<br>from the source According to experiment the speed of light<br>remains constant regardless of the state of motion of the ob-<br>server Common sense and experimental findings are in violent<br>disagreement<br>
Einstein s beginner s mind told him that, since we cannot<br>
argue with what is (the experimental evidence), then our<br>common sense must be wrong With this decision to disregard<br>common sense and to base his new theory on the only clothes<br>he could see that the emperor<i> was</i> wearing (the constant<br>speed of light and the principle of relativity) Einstein stepped<br>boldly into the unknown in fact, into the unimaginable Al-<br>ready on new territory, he proceeded to explore where no<br>person had gone before<br>
How could it be that to everv observer the speed of light is<br>
the same regardless of their state of motion'1 To measure speed,<br>it is necessary to use a clock and ruler (a rigid rod) If the<br>speed of light as measured by an observer at rest relative to a<br>light source is the same as the speed of light as measured by<br>
an observer in motion relative to the source, then it must be<br>

that, somehow,<i> the</i><br>
<i> instruments</i> change from one<br>
frame of reference to the other in just such a way that the<br>speed of light always appears to be the same<br>
The speed of light appears constant because the rods and<br>
clocks used to measure it vary from one frame of reference to<br>another depending upon their<i> motion</i> In short, to an observer<br>at rest, a moving rod changes its length and a moving clock<br>changes its rhythm At the same time, to an observer traveling<br>along with a moving rod and clock, there is no apparent change<br>at all in length or rh&gt;thm Therefore, both observers measure<br>the speed of light to be the same, and neither can detect<br>anything unusual in the measurement or in the measuring<br>apparatus<br>
This is very similar to the case of the Michelson-Morley<br>
experiment<br>
 to Fit/Gerald and Lorentz, the arm of<br>
the interferometer that faces into the ether wind (now dismissed<br>from our theory) is shortened bv the pressure of the ether<br>wind Therefore, the light that travels the interferometer arm<br>facing into the ' efher wind' has less distance to travel and<br>more time to do it in than does the light traveling the other<br>arm As a result, the speed of light traveling both arms appears<br>to be the same This is what the Lorentz transformations de-<br>scribe Come to think of it,<i> the Lorentz transformations can<br>be</i><br>
<i> to</i><br>
<i> contractions due to motion</i> as well as<br>
contractions due to a fictitious ether wind<br>
FitzGerald and Lorentz imagined that rigid rods were com-<br>
pressed under the pressure of the ether wind, but according<br>to Einstein, it is<i> motion</i><br>
 causes contraction, and, in<br>
addition time dilation<br>
Here is another way of looking at it A &quot;constant velocity of<br>
light&quot; is exactly what would result if moving measuring rods<br>became shoiter and moving clocks ran more slowly because a<br>moving observer would measure the speed of light with a<br>shorter measuring rod (less distance for the light to travel) and<br>
a slower clock (more tune to do it in) than an observer at rest<br>
Each observer, however, would consider his own rod and<br>
clock to be quite normal and unimpaired Therefore, both<br>observers would find the speed of light to be 186,000 miles<br>per sec ond and both of them would be puz/led bv this fact if<br>they were still bound by the classical transformation laws<br>
These were the initial fruits of Einstein's basic assumptions<br>
(the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light and the<br>principle of relativity) First, a moving object appears to<br>

conti act in its direction of motion and become shorter as its<br>velocity increases until, at the speed of light, it disappears alto-<br>gether Second, a moving clock runs more slowly than a clock<br>at rest, and continues to slow its rhythm as its velocity increases<br>until, at the speed of light, it stops running altogether<br>
These effects only appear to a &quot;stationary&quot; observer one<br>
who is at rest relative to the moving clock and rod They do<br>not appear to an observer who is traveling along with the<br>clock and rod To make this clear Einstein introduced the<br>labels 'proper&quot; and 'relative &quot; What we see when we observe<br>our stationary rod and our<br>
 clock, if we ourselves are<br>
stationary, is their<i> proper</i> length and<i> proper</i> time (&quot;Proper&quot;<br>means &quot;one s own ') Proper lengths and proper times always<br>appear normal What we see if we are stationary and observe<br>
a rod and a clock traveling very fast relative to us is the<br><i>relative</i> length of the moving rod and the<i> relative</i> time of<br>the moving clock The relative length is always shorter than the<br>proper length, and the relative time is always slower than<br>the proper time<br>
The time that you see on your own watch is your proper<br>
time, and the time that you see on the watch of the person<br>moving past you is the relative time (which appears to you—not<br>to the person moving past you—to run more slowly) The<br>length of the measuring rod in vour own hand is its proper<br>length, and the length of the measuring rod in the hand of the<br>person moving past you is its relative length (which appears to<br>
you—but not to the other person—to be shorter) From the<br>point of view of the person moving past you, he is at rest, you<br>are moving, and the situation is reversed<br>

function in slow motion His rolled cigarette, for example,<br>lasts twice as long as one of ours<br>
Of course, part of his sluggishness is due to the fact that he<br>
is fast increasing the distance between us, and with each passing<br>moment, it takes the light from his spaceship longer to reach<br>us Nonetheless, after making allowances for the travel time<br>of the light involved, we find that the astronaut still is moving<br>more slowly than usual<br>

The time that we ourselves experience and measure is our<br>

Einstein's theory has been substantiated in many ways All<br>
of them verify it with awesome accuracy<br>
The most common verifications of time dilation come from<br>
high-energy particle physics A very light elementary particle,<br>called a muon (pronounced moo'on), is created at the top of<br>the earth s atmosphere by the collision of protons (one form of<br>
 cosmic radiation ) and air molecules We know from experi-<br>
ments in which muons are created in accelerators that they<br>live a very short time Bv no means do they live long enough<br>to<br>
 the earth from the upper atmosphere Long before<br>
the time it takes to traverse this distance they should decay<br>spontaneously into other types of particles Yet this does not<br>
happen because we detect them in abundance here at the<br>earth s surface<br>
Why do the muons created bv cosmic radiation live longer,<br>
in fact,<i> seven times longer</i> than those muons created in the<br>laboratory The answer is that the muons produced by colli-<br>sions of cosmic radiation and air molecules travel much faster<br>than any muons that we can create<br>
 Their<br>
velocity is approximately 99 percent of the speed of light At<br>that speed, time dilation is quite noticeable They do not live<br>longer than usual from<i> their</i> point of view, but from our point<br>of view they live seven times longer than they would at slower<br>
velocities<br>
This is true not only of muons but of almost all subatomic<br>
particles, and there are manv of them For example, pions<br>(pie'ons), another type of subatomic particle which move at 80<br>percent of the speed of light, live, on the average 1 67 times<br>as long as slow pions The special theory of relativity tells us<br>that the intrinsic lifetime of these high-speed particles does<br>not increase, but that their relative rate of time flow slows<br>down The special theory of relativ ity also made the calcula-<br>tion of these phenomena possible long before we had the<br>technical capability to create them<br>

According to the special theory of relativity, a moving ob-<br>

increases James Terrell, a physicist, has demonstrated math-<br>ematically that this phenomenon is something like a visual<br>illusion, and, in fact, is analogous to a projection of the real<br>world onto the wall of Plato's cave 6<br>
Plato's famous parable of the cave describes a group of<br>
people who are chained inside a cave in such a way that they<br>can see only the shadows on the wall of the cave These<br>
shadows are the only world that these people know One day<br>
one of these people escapes into the world outside the cave<br>At first he is blinded by the sunlight, but when he recovers,<br>he realizes that<i> this</i> is the real world, and what he previously<br>considered to be the real world was, in fact, only the projection<br>of the real world onto the wall of the cave (Unfortunately,<br>when he returned to the people who still were chained inside<br>the cave, they thought he was mad)<br>

The first step in Terrell's explanation is to draw lines<br>
downward (back into the page) from each of the two points on<br>the sphere to a screen direttlv below the sphere Figure B is<br>a side view showing the two points, the lines that we have<br>drawn downward, and the screen (If vou hold this book directly<br>in front of you, your eyes are in the same position relative to<br>the dotted lines as the eyes drawn in Figure A)<br>
To understand Terrell's explanation, suppose that the sphere<br>
is moving<i> very fast</i> relative to the speed of light from right to<br>left If the sphere moves fast enough, some very interesting<br>things happen For example, before the light from the point<br>on the far left edge of the sphere can reach us, the ball moves<br>in front of it, blocking it from our vision' The reverse happens<br>on the far right The ball moves out from between us and the<br>light signals originating from points that used to be on the<br>&quot;back&quot; side of the ball These signals now are visible to us,<br>
while the signals coming from the point that used to be on the<br>leading edge of the ball now are blocked by the ball itself as it<br>moves to the left The effect of this is an illusion of sorts<br>What we see is the same thing that we would see if someone<br>had<i> rotated</i> the ball around its axis'<br>
Look what happened to the distance between the two points<br>
as projected on the screen It is considerably less than when<br>
we started The equations in the special theory of<br>
(the Lorentz transformations) which show a contraction due to<br>motion describe these<i> projections</i> (Is this beginning to sound<br>like Plato's<br>
The fact that the ball, by moving fast enough, gets in the<br>
way of some of its own light signals and out of the way of<br>others causes the ball to appear to rotate This causes the<br><i>projected</i> distance between any two points on it which are<br>aligned with the direction of motion to decrease, just as if<br>someone really had rotated the ball The faster the ball moves,<br>the more it appears to &quot;rotate,&quot; and the closer together come<br>the points projected on the screen It is the projection that<br>
contracts Instead of &quot;screen&quot; substitute &quot;view of the ball from<br>our frame of reference&quot; and we have the Terrell explanation<br>of relativistic contraction<br>
As yet, no analogous explanations have been found for the<br>
time dilation that accompanies moving clocks or the increase<br>of mass that accompanies moving objects, but the effort, rela-<br>
tively speaking, is young<br>

The special theory of relativity shows thai the mass of a<br>
moving object increases as the velocity of the object increases<br>Newton would not have hesitated to call this nonsense, but<br>then Newton s experience was limited to velocities that are<br>quite slow compared to the speed of light<br>
Classical physics tells us that a specific amount of force is<br>
required to increase the velocitv of a moving object by a given<br>amount for example, one foot per second Once we know<br>what that amount of force is, whenever we want to increase<br>the velocity of that particular object by one foot per second, all<br>
we need do is<br>
 that amount of force to it If the object<br>
has a velocity of 100 feet per second, that specific amount of<br>force will increase its velocity to 101 feet per second Accord-<br>ing to Newton s physics, the same amount of force that in-<br>creases the velocity of an object from 100 feet per second to<br>
101 feet per second also will increase the velocity of the same<br>
object from 8,000 feet per second to 8,001 feet per second<br>
The problem is that Newtonian phvsics is wrong It takes<br>
much more force to increase by one foot per second the velocity<br>of an object moving at 8,000 feet per second than it takes to<br>increase by one foot per second the velocity of the same<br>object moving at 100 feet per second<br>
That is because a faster-moving object has more kinetic<br>
energy (energy of motion) This additional energy makes it<br>behave exactly as if it had more mass A given amount of force<br>applied for a given amount of time will accelerate a single<br>freight car to a greater velocity than the same amount of force<br>applied for the same amount of time to an entire train Of<br>course, this is because an entire tram has more mass than a<br>single car<br>
When particles travel at velocities that are fast relative to<br>
the speed of light their high kinetic energy makes them be-<br>
have as though they have more mass than they have at lower<br>velocities In fact, the special theory of relativity shows that<br>the effective mass of a moving object<i> does</i> increase with velocity<br>
Since most subatomic particles travel at different velocities,<br>
each one of them can have many different relative masses<br>
Therefore, physicists have calculated the &quot;rest mass' of each<br>particle The rest mass of a subatomic particle is its mass<br>when it is not moving Subatomic particles are never really at<br>

led to some spectacular revisions in the way that we see the<br>world It showed that there is no &quot;universal&quot; time that per-<br>meates the universe There are only proper times associated<br>with various observers The proper time of each obsen er is<br>different, unless two of them happen to be at rest relative to<br>each other If the universe has a heart beat, its rate depends<br>upon the hearer<br>
The special theory of relativity shows that two events which<br>
happen at the same time in one frame of reference may occur<br>at different times when seen from another frame of reference<br>To illustrate this point, Einstein used one of his famous thought<br>experiments<br>

the light flashes The question is, is there any difference be-<br>tween what we see inside the moving room and what the<br>outside observer sees According to the special theory of<br>relativity, the answer is an extraordinary, concept-shattering<br>Yes There is a big difference<br>
Inside the room, we see the bulb flash and we see the light<br>
spread out in all directions at the same speed Since the walls<br>
of the room are equidistant from the bulb we see the light<br>strike the forward wall and rearward wall of the room simulta-<br>neously<br>
The outside observer also sees the flash, and he also sees<br>
the light propagate in all directions at the same speed How-<br>ever, in addition, he sees that the room is moving From his<br>

point of view the forward wall tries to escape the approaching<br>light while the rearward wall rushes to meet it<br>
 to<br>
the outside observer, the light reaches the rearward wall before<br>it reaches the forward wall If the speed of the room is small<br>compared to the speed of light, the light reaches the rearward<br>wall only slightly ahead of the forward wall Nonetheless the<br>light reaches the rearward and forward walls in a one-two<br>order, and not at the same time<br>
Although both of us observed the same two events, the<br>
light striking the forward wall and the light striking the rearward<br>wall, we each have different stories to tell To us inside the<br>room, the two events were simultaneous To the outside ob-<br>server, one event came first and the other event came later<br>
Einstein's revolutionary insight was that events which are<br>
simultaneous for one observer may occur at different times for<br>
another observer depending upon their relative motion Put<br>another way, two events, one of which occurs before the other<br>as seen from the frame of reference of one observer, may<br>occur at the same time when seen from the frame of reference<br>of another observer One observer uses the words sooner&quot;<br>and &quot;later The other observer uses the word ' simultaneous,&quot;<br>even though both of them are describing the same two events<br>
In other words, ' sooner ' ' later, and simultaneous' are<br>
local terms They have no meaning in the universe at large<br>unless they are tied down to a specific frame of reference<br>What is sooner in one frame of reference may be 'later&quot; in<br>another frame of reference and simultaneous&quot; in a third *<br>
The mathematics which translate what an observer in one<br>
frame of reference sees into what an observer in another frame<br>of reference sees are the<br>
 transformations Einstein<br>
adopted the Lorentz transformations — which are a set of<br>equations — virtually intact<br>

Even when the Michelson-Morley experiment produced<br>
results that were incompatible with the classical transformation<br>
laws, no beginner s mind but Einstein's conceived that the<br>classical transformation laws might be wrong Only Einstein<br>suspected that at very high velocities, velocities far faster than<br>those that we encounter through our senses, the classical<br>transformation laws do not apply This is not to say that they<br>are incorrect At low velocities (compared to 186,000 miles<br>per second) contraction and time dilation are not detectable<br>sensonly In this limited situation, the classical transformations<br>are a good guide for practical experience After all, we<i> do<br></i>reach the top of an escalator faster if we walk<br>
If we do the moving-room experiment with sound instead<br>
of light we do not get the special theory of relativity We get<br>a confirmation of the classical transformation laws There is no<br>principle of the constancy of the velocity of sound because the<br>velocity of sound is not constant It varies depending upon<br>the motion of the observer (hearer) as dictated by common<br>sense The important word here is &quot;dictated<br>
We live out our lives in a limited situation of low velocities<br>
where the speed of sound (about 700 miles per hour) seems<br>
&quot;fast Therefore our common sense is based upon our<br>experiences in this limited environment If we want to expand<br>
our understanding beyond the limitations of this environment,<br>it is necessary to drastically rearrange our conceptual constructs<br>This is what Einstein did He was the first person to see that<br>this is what had to be done in order to make sense of such<br>impossible experimental findings as the constancy of the velocity<br>of light for each and every person who measures it, regardless<br>of their states of motion<br>
This led him to turn the<br>
 of the constancy of the<br>
 of light into the principle of the constancy of the<br>
velocity of light In turn, that led him to the conclusion that,<br>if the velocity of light really is constant for all observers, then<br>the measuring instruments used by different observers in dif-<br>ferent states of motion somehow must vary so that all of them<br>give the same result By a stroke of luck Einstein discovered<br>that these same variances were expressed in the equations of<br>

This conclusion is precisely the opposite of the assumption<br>
upon which Newtonian physics is based Newton assumed, as<br>did we all, that there is one clock ticking off the seconds by<br>which the entire universe grows older For every second of<br>time that passes in this corner of the universe, one second of<br>time passes also in every other corner of the universe<br>
According to Einstein, this is incorrect How can anyone<br>
say when it is &quot;now&quot; throughout the<br>
 If we try to<br>
designate &quot;now&quot; by the occurrence of two simultaneous events<br>(like mv arrival at the doctor's office and my watch indicating<br>3 o'clock), we find that an observer in another frame of reference<br>sees one of our events happening before the other Absolute<br>time, wrote Newton, 'flows equably  , ' b u t he was wrong<br>There is no single time which flows equallv for all observers<br>There is no absolute time<br>
The existence of one ultimate flow of time throughout the<br>
physical universe, which we all tacitly acknowledged, turned<br>out to be another piece of clothing that the Emperor wasn t<br>wearing<br>
Newton made one more mistake in this regard He said<br>
that time and space were separate According to Einstein,<br>time and space are not separate Something cannot exist at<br>some place without existing at some time, and neither can it<br>exist at some time without existing at some place<br>
Most of us think of space and time as separate because that<br>
is the way that we think that we experience them For example,<br>we seem to have some control over our position in space, but<br>none at all over our position in time There is nothing that we<br>can do about the flow of time We can choose to stand perfectly<br>still, in which case our position in space does not change, but<br>there is no way that we can stand still in time<br>
This notwithstanding, there is something very elusive about<br>
'space&quot; and especially about 'time ', something that prevents<br>
us from ' resting our accounts with them prematurely<br>Subjectively, time has a fluid quality which much resembles a<br>running brook, sometimes bubbling past in a furious rush,<br>sometimes slipping by quietly unnoticed and sometimes lying<br>

distance measurements, we both get the same space-time in-<br>terval between the events<br>
Actually, this Pvthagorean-like relationship was the discovery<br>
of Einstein's mathematics teacher, Hermann Mmkowski, who<br>was inspired by his most famous student s special theory of<br>relativity In 1908 Mmkowski announced his vision this way<br>
Henceforth space by itself, and time bv itself, are doomed<br>to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union<br>of the two will preserve an independent reality 8<br>
Mmkowski s mathematical explorations of space and time<br>
were both revolutionary and fascinating Out of them came a<br>simple diagram of space-time showing the mathematical rela-<br>tionship of the past, present, and the future Of the wealth of<br>information contained in this diagram., the most striking is<br>that all of the past and all of the future for each individual,<br>meet and forever meet, at one single point,<i> now</i> Further-<br>more, the<i> now</i> of each individual is specifically located, and<br>
will never be found in any other place than<i> here</i> (wherever<br>the observer is at)<br>
Sixty-three years before Ram Dass's great book,<i> Be Here</i><br>
<i>Now,</i> established the watchwords of the awareness movement,<br>
Hermann Mmkowski proved that, in physical reality, no choice<br>exists in the matter (punr') Unfoi tunatelv for physicists, the<br>realization is not always the experience Nonetheless, after<br>two thousand years of use in the East, being here now, the<br>
beginning step in meditation received the validation of western<br>science via Mmkowski s rigorous mathematical confirmation of<br>it inspired bv the special theorv of relativity<br>

relativitv is the revelation that mass is a form of energy, and<br>that energy has mass In Einstein's words, &quot;Energy has mass<br>and mass represents energy &quot;9<br>
Although this sounds shocking in one sense, in the sense<br>
that we have believed ever so long that matter, stuff,' is<br>different from energy just as the body is different from the<br>mind (another form of the same theory), in another sense, it<br>sounds surprising!) natural The matter-energy dichotomy goes<br>back at least as far as the Old Testament Genesis portrays<br>man as a sort of ceramic creation God scoops up a handful<br>

In the East, however, there never has been much philo-<br>

 The world of matter is a<br>
relative world, and an illusorv one illusory not in the sense<br>that it does not exist but illusory in the sense that we do not<br>see it as it really is The way it really is cannot be communi-<br>cated verbally, but in the attempt to talk around it, eastern<br>literature speaks repeatedly of dancing energy and transient,<br>impermanent forms This is strikingly similar to the picture of<br>physical reality emerging from high-energy particle physics<br>Buddhist literature does not speak of learning new things<br>about reahtv, but about removing veils of ignorance that stand<br>between us and what we<br>
<i> are</i> Perhaps this accounts<br>
for the fact that the preposterous claim that mass is only a<br>
form of energy is unexpectedly palatable<br>
The formula which expresses the relationship of mass to<br>
energy is the most famous formula in the world E = me2 The<br>energy contained in a piece of matter is equal to the mass of<br>the matter multiplied by an extraordinarily large number, the<br>speed of light squared This means that even the tiniest, the<br>very tiniest particle of matter has within it a tremendous amount<br>of concentrated energy<br>
Although Einstein didn't know it at the time, he discovered<br>
the secret of stellar energy Stars continuously convert matter<br>into energy It is because of the very large ratio of energy<br>released to matter consumed that stars can continue to burn<br>through countless millennia<br>

 of fusion<br>
Instead of fusing smaller atoms into larger ones, the process of<br>fission splits atoms of uranium, v\hich are quite large into<br>atoms<br>
 are smaller<br>
This is done by firing a subatomic paiticle, a neutron, at an<br>
atom of uranium When the neutron hits the uranium atom it<br>splits it into lighter atoms, but the mass of these smaller<br>atoms together is less than the mass of the<br>
 atom of<br>
uranium The difference in mass explodes into energy This<br>process also produces additional neutrons which fly off to strike<br>
other uranium atoms creating more fissions more light atoms,<br>more energy, and more neutrons The whole phenomenon is<br>
called a chain reaction An atomic bomb is an uncontrolled<br>chain reaction<br>
A hydrogen<br>
 bomb is produced by detonating an<br>
atomic (fission) bomb in the midst of hvdrogen The heat from<br>the atomic explosion (in place of the heat of friction caused by<br>gravity) fuses hydrogen atoms into helium atoms and releases<br>
heat in the process which fuses together more hvdrogen atoms,<br>
releasing more heat<br>
 so on There is no limit to the size of<br>
a potential hvdrogen bomb, and it is constructed from the<br>most plentiful element in the universe<br>
For better or worse a major revelation of the special theory<br>

In all, there are roughlv twelve conservation laws These<br>

One side of a circle is called &quot;yin&quot; and other side is called<br>&quot;yang.&quot; Where there is yin. there is yang. Where there is<br>high, there also is low. Where there is day, there also is<br>night. Where there is death, there also is birth. The concept<br>
of yin-yang, which is really a very old law of symmetry, is yet<br>another way of saying that the physical universe is a whole<br>which seeks balance within itself.<br>
The irony of the special theory of relativity, as apparent by<br>
now, is that it is not about those aspects of reality that are<br>relative, but about those aspects that are not relative. Like<br>quantum mechanics, its impact on the assumptions of New-<br>tonian physics was shattering. Not because it proved them<br>wrong, but because it proved them to be quite limited. The<br>special theory of relativity and quantum mechanics have<br>propelled us into unimaginably expansive areas of reality, areas<br>about which we literally had not one previous idea.<br>
The assumptions of Newtonian physics correspond to the<br>
clothes we always thought that the Emperor was wearing: a<br>universal time whose uniform passage equally affects every<br>
part of the universe, a separate space, independent though<br>empty; and the belief that there exists somewhere in the<br>
universe a place which stands absolutely still, quiet and<br>unmoving.<br>
Every one of these assumptions has been proven untrue<br>
(not useful) by the special theory of relativity. The Emperor<br>
wasn't wearing them at all. The only motion in the physical<br>universe is motion relative to something else. There is no<br>separate space and time. Mass and energy are different names<br>for the same thing.<br>
In place of these assumptions, the special theory of relativity<br>
provides a new and unified physics. Measurements of distance<br>and duration may vary from one frame of reference to an-<br>other, but the space-time interval between events never<br>
changes.<br>
For all this, however, the special theory of relativity has<br>
one shortcoming. It is based on a rather uncommon situation.<br>The special theory of relativity applies only to frames of<br>reference that move uniformly, relative to each other. Most<br>
movement, unfortunately, is neither constant nor ideally<br>
smooth. In other words, the.special theory of relativity is built<br>upon an idealization. It is limited to and premised upon the<br>

special situation of uniform motion. That is why Einstein called<br>it the &quot;special,&quot; or restricted, theory.<br>
Einstein's vision was to construct a physics that is valid for<br>
<i>all</i> frames of reference, such as those moving with non-uniform<br>motion (acceleration and deceleration) relative to each other,<br>as well as those moving uniformly relative to each other His<br>
 was to create a physics which could describe events in<br>
terms of<i> any</i> frame of reference, no matter how it moves<br>relative to any other frame of reference.<br>

 of his special theory. He called this achieve-<br>

beginner's mind<br>
 was that this is so only in our minds *<br>
Einstein discovered that certain laws of geometry are valid<br>
only in limited regions of space This makes them useful since<br>our experience physically is limited to very small regions of<br>space, like our solar system However, as our experience<br>expands, we encounter more and more difficulty in trying to<br>superimpose these rules upon the entire expanse of the<br>universe<br>
Einstein was the first person to see that the geometrical<br>
rules which apply to one small part of the universe as seen<br>from a limited perspective (like ours) are not universal This<br>
freed him to behold the universe in a way that no person had<br>
seen it before<br>
What he saw is the content of the general theory of relativity<br>
Einstein did not set out to prove anything about the nature<br>
of our minds His interest was in physics Our new idea, ' he<br>wrote is simple to build a phvsics valid for all co-ordinate<br>systems<br>
 The fact that he<i> did</i> illustrate something of impor-<br>
tance about the way that we structure our perceptions is indi-<br>cative of an inevitable trend toward the merger of physics and<br>psychology<br>
How did Einstein get from a theory of physics to a revolu-<br>

tive to each other Is it possible, thought Einstein, to explain<br>the same phenomenon as seen from two different frames of<br>reference, one of them moving uniformly and the other of<br>them moving non-umformly, in such a way that there is a<br>consistent explanation for the phenomenon in terms of both<br>the uniformly moving frame of reference and the non-umformly<br>moving frame of reference In other words, can we describe<br>events which happen in a co-ordinate system which is moving<br>non-umformlv in terms which are meaningful to an observer<br>in a co-ordinate system which is moving uniformly, and the<br>
other way round Can we create<i> one</i> physics that is valid for<br>observers in both frames of reference<br>
Yes, discovered Einstein, it is possible for observers m the<br>
two different frames of reference to relate in a manner which<br>is both meaningful in terms of their own state of motion and<br>in terms of the other's state of motion To illustrate this, he<br>used another famous thought experiment<br>
Imagine an elevator in an<br>
 tall building The<br>
cable which supports the elevator has snapped, and the elevator<br>is plummeting downward Inside the elevator are several phys-<br>icists They are not aware that the cable has broken, and,<br>since there are no windows, they cannot look outside<br>
The question is, what is the appraisal of this situation by<br>
the observers on the outside of the elevator (us) and by the<br>observers on the inside of the elevator (the physicists) Since<br>this is an idealized experiment, we can disregard the effects of<br>
friction and the resistance of the air<br>
To us, the situation is apparent The elevator is falling and<br>
soon it will strike the earth and all of its inhabitants will be<br>dead As the elevator falls, it accelerates according to Newton's<br>law of gravity The motion of the elevator is not uniform, but<br>accelerated, because of the gravitational field of the earth<br>
We can predict many things that might happen inside the<br>
elevator For example, if someone inside the elevator dropped<br>a handkerchief, nothing would happen It would appear to the<br>inside observers to float where it was released because it<br>
would be accelerating toward the earth at the same rate as the<br>elevator and the people inside of it Nothing really would be<br>floating, everything would be falling, but, since everything<br>would be falling at the same rate, there would be no change<br>
in their relative positions<br>
To a generation of physicists born and brought up inside<br>
the elevator, however, things would appear quite differently<br>

To them, dropped objects do not fall, they simply hang in<br>
midair If someone gives a floating object a shove, off it goes<br>in a straight line until it hits the side of the elevator To the<br>observers inside the elevator, there are no forces acting on<br>any objects inside the elevator In short, the observers inside<br>the elevator would conclude that they are in an mertial co-<br>
ordinate system1 The laws of mechanics are perfectly valid<br>Their experiments always produce results which agree exactly<br>with theoretical predictions An object at rest remains at rest<br>An object n motion remains in motion Moving objects are<br>deflected from their paths only by forces which are proportional<br>to the amount of deflection For every reaction there is an<br>
equal and opposite reaction If we give a shove to a floating<br>chair, it goes off in one direction, and we go off in the oppo-<br>site direction with an equal momentum (although with a slower<br>speed because of our greater mass)<br>
The inside observers have a consistent explanation for the<br>
phenomena inside the elevator They are in an mertial co-<br>ordinate system, and they can prove it by the laws of<br>mechanics<br>
The outside observers also have a consistent explanation for<br>
the phenomena inside the elevator The elevator is falling in a<br>gravitational field Its passengers are unaware of this because,<br>without being able to see outside the elevator, there is no way<br>for them to detect it while they are falling Their co-ordinate<br>system is in accelerated motion, even though thev believe<br>that it is not moving at all<br>
The bridge between these two explanations is gravity<br>
The falling elevator is a pocket edition of an mertial co-<br>
ordinate system A real mertial co-ordinate system is not lim-<br>ited in space or time The elevator edition is limited in both<br>It is limited in space because a moving object inside the<br>elevator will not move in a straight line forever, but only until<br>it reaches one of the walls of the elevator It is limited in time<br>because sooner or later the elevator and its passengers are<br>going to collide with the earth, ending their existence abruptly<br>
According to the special theory of relativity, moreover, it is<br>
significant that the elevator is limited in size because other-<br>wise it would not appear to its inhabitants as an mertial co-<br>
ordinate system For example, if the physicists inside the elevator<br>simultaneously drop two baseballs, the baseballs float in the<br>air exactly where they are released, and remain there This,<br>

to the outside observer, is because they are falling parallel to<br>each other. However, if the elevator were the size of Texas<br>and the baseballs were as far apart when they were dropped<br>as Texas is wide, the baseballs would not fall parallel to each<br>
other. They would<br>
 since each of them would be<br>
drawn by gravity to the center of the earth. The observers<br>inside the elevator would notice that the baseballs, and any<br>other floating objects in the elevator, move toward each other<br>
with the passage of time, as though there were a mutual<br>attraction between them. This mutual attraction would appear<br>as a &quot;force&quot; affecting the objects in the elevator, and the<br>physicists inside hardly would conclude, under those circum-<br>stances, that they were in an inertial co-ordinate system.<br>
In short, if it is small enough,<i> a co-ordinate system falling</i><br>
<i>in a gravitational field is the equivalent of an inertial co-<br>ordinate system.</i> This is Einstein's principle of equivalence. It<br>is a telling piece of mental dexterity. Anything like an &quot;inertial<br>
co-ordinate system&quot; that can be &quot;wiped out&quot;2 (Einstein's words)<br>by the assumption of a gravitational field hardly deserves to<br>be called absolute (as in &quot;absolute motion,&quot; and &quot;absolute<br>non-motion&quot;). While the observers inside the elevator exper-<br>ience a lack of motion and the absence of gravity, the observ-<br>ers outside the elevator see a co-ordinate system (the elevator)<br>accelerating through a gravitational field<br>
Now let us imagine a variation of this situation.<br>Assume that<i> we,</i> the outside observers, are in an inertial<br>
co-ordinate system. We already know what happens in inertial<br>co-ordinate systems; the same things that happened in the<br>falling elevator. There are no forces, including gravity, to<br>affect us. Therefore, let us assume that we are comfortably<br>floating. Objects at rest remain at rest, objects in motion<br>continue in a straight line forever, and every action produces<br>an equal and opposite reaction.<br>
In our inertial co-ordinate system is an elevator. Someone<br>
has attached a rope to the elevator and is pulling it in the<br>direction indicated (next page). Since this is a thought experi-<br>ment, it does not matter how this is done. The elevator- is<br>being pulled with a constant force, which means that it is in a<br>state of constant acceleration in the direction of the arrow.<br>How will observers outside the elevator and observers inside<br>the elevator appraise this situation?<br>
As we float outside the elevator, we experience that our<br>
frame of reference is absolutely at rest and that there is no<br>

gravity affecting it. We see the elevator being pulled with a<br>constant acceleration by the rope, and so we can predict cer-<br>tain things about it. Everything inside the elevator that is not<br>attached quickly collides with the floor of the elevator. If<br>someone in the elevator drops a handkerchief, the elevator<br>
floor rushes up to meet it. If someone in the elevator tries to<br>
jump off the floor, the floor, rushing upward, is instantly<br>
under his feet again. The floor of the elevator continually<br>
crashes into anything in its path as it accelerates upward.<br>
Inside the elevator, however, the appraisal of the situation<br>
is quite different. To a generation of physicists born and brought<br>up inside the elevator, talk of acceleration upward is fantasy<br>(remember, the elevator has no windows). To them, their<br>
co-ordinate system is quite at rest. Objects fall downward to<br>
the floor because of a gravitational field, just as objects on the<br>
earth fall downward to the floor because of a gravitational<br>
field.<br>
Both the observers inside the elevator and the observers<br>
outside the elevator have consistent explanations for the<br>phenomena inside the elevator. We observers outside the<br>
elevator explain them by the accelerated motion of the elevator.<br>

Wait a minute we say suppose that we cut a small hole<br>
in one wall of the elevator and shine a light beam through it<br>If the elevator really were motionless the light beam would<br>strike the opposite wall of the elev ator at a spot exactly oppo<br>site the hole Since we can see that the elevator is accelerat<br>ing upward we know that the elevator wall will move upward<br>slightly in the time it takes the light beam to cross the elevator<br>
Therefore the light beam will strike the far wall slightly below<br>the spot just opposite the hole it entered through In effect, it<br>will seem to curve downward from the point of view of the<br>people inside the elevator instead of traveling in a straight<br>line This should prove to them that their elevator is m motion<br>

There are two kinds of mass which means that there are<br>
two wavs of talking about it The first is gravitational mass<br>The gravitational mass of an object roughlv speaking is the<br>weight of the object as measured on a balance scale Something<br>that weighs three times more than another object has three<br>times more mass Gravitational mass is the measure of how<br>much force the<br>
 of the earth exerts on an object<br>
Newton s laws describe the effects of this force which varv<br>with the distance of the mass from the earth Although Newton s<br>laws describe the effects of this force they do not define it<br>
This is the mystery of action-at-a-distance (page 23) How<br>
does the earth invisibly reach up and pull objects downward<br>
The second type of mass is mertial mass Inertial mass is<br>
the measure of the resistance of an object to acceleration (or<br>deceleration which is negative acceleration) For example it<br>takes three times more force to move three railroad cars from<br>a standstill to twenty miles per hour (positive acceleration)<br>than it takes to move one railroad car from a standstill to<br>twenty miles per hour (page 144) Similarly, once they are<br>moving it takes three times more force to stop three cars<br>than it takes to stop the single car This is because the mertial<br>
mass of the three railroad cars is three times more than the<br>mertial mass of the single railroad car<br>
<i>Inertial mass and</i><br>
<i> mass are equal</i> This explains<br>
why a feather and a cannonball fall with equal velocity in a<br>vacuum The cannonball has hundreds of times more gravita-<br>tional mass than the feather (it weighs more) but it also has<br>hundreds of times more resistance to motion than the feather<br>(its mertial mass) Its attraction to the earth is hundreds of<br>times stronger than that of the feather but then so is its<br>inclination not to move The result is that it accelerates<br>downward at the same rate as the feather although it seems<br>that it should fall much faster<br>
The fact that mertial mass and gravitational mass are equal<br>
was known three hundred years ago, but physicists consid-<br>ered it a coincidence No significance was attached to it until<br>
Einstein published his general theory of relativity<br>
The coincidence of the equivalence of gravitational mass<br>
and mertial mass was the clew 3 to use Einstein s word that<br>led him to the principle of equivalence which refers via the<br>equivalence of gravitational mass and mertial mass to the<br>equivalence of gravity and acceleration themselves These are<br>the things that he illustrated with his famous elevator examples<br>

The special theory of relativity deals with unaccelerated<br>
(uniform) motion.* If acceleration is neglected, the special<br>theory of relativity applies. However, since gravity and accel-<br>eration are equivalent, this is the same as saying that the<br>special theory of relativity is applicable whenever gravity is<br>neglected. If the effects of gravity are to be considered, then<br>
we must use the general theory of relativity. In the physical<br>world the effects of gravity can be neglected in (1) remote<br>
regions of space which are far from any centers of gravity<br>
(matter), and (2) in very small regions of space.<br>
Why gravity can be ignored in very small regions of space<br>
leads to the most psychedelic aspect of all Einstein's theories.<br>Gravity can be ignored in very small regions of space because,<br>if the region is small enough, the mountainous terrain of space-<br>
time is not noticeable.!<br>
The nature of the space-time continuum is like that of a<br>
hilly countryside. The hills are caused by pieces of matter<br>(objects). The larger the piece of matter, the more it curves<br>the space-time continuum. In remote regions of space far<br>from any matter of significant size, the space-time continuum<br>resembles a flat plain. A piece of matter the size of the earth<br>causes quite a bump in the space-time continuum, and apiece<br>of matter the size of a star causes a relative mountain.<br>
As an object travels through the space-time continuum, it<br>
takes the easiest path between two points. The easiest path<br>between two points in the space-time continuum is called a<br>geodesic (geo dee' sic). A geodesic is not always a straight line<br>owing to the nature of the terrain in which the object finds<br>itself.<br>
Suppose that we are in a balloon looking down on a mountain<br>
that has a bright beacon on the top of it. The mountain rises<br>
gradually out of the plain, and becomes more and more steep<br>as its elevation increases, until, close to the top, it rises al-<br>
most straight up. There are many villages surrounding the<br>
* The special theory deals with the unaccelerated (uniform) motion of&quot;<i> co-</i><br>
<i>ordinate systems</i> The special theory can be used to describe the accelerated<br>(non-uniform) motion of<br>
 as long as the<br>
 system from which<br>
the object is being observed is itself in uniform motion.<br>
t Some physicists think that general relativity will be useful on the microscalc<br>of high-energy physics (where the effects of gravity usually arc ignored), e.g ,<br>strong fluctuations of the gravitational field have been detected at very short<br>distances (It)'14 cm).<br>

mountain, and there are footpaths connecting all of the villages<br>
with each other. As the paths approach the mountain, all of<br>them begin to curve in one way or another, to avoid going<br>unnecessarily far up the mountain.<br>
Suppose that it is nighttime and that, looking down, we<br>
can see neither the mountain nor the footpaths. All that we<br>can see is the beacon and the torches of the travelers below.<br>As we watch, we notice that the torches deflect from a straight<br>path when they approach the vicinity of the beacon. Some of<br>them curve gently around the beacon in a graceful arc some<br>
distance away from it. Others approach the beacon more<br>directly, but the closer they get to it, the more sharply they<br>turn away from it.<br>
From this, we probably would deduce that some force<br>
emanating from the beacon was repelling all attempts to ap-<br>proach it. For example, we might speculate that the beacon is<br>extremely hot and painful to approach.<br>
With the coming of daylight, however, we can see that the<br>
beacon is situated on the top of a large mountain and that it<br>has nothing whatever to do with the movement of the torch-<br>bearers. They simply followed the easiest paths available to<br>them over the terrain between their points of origin and des-<br>tination.<br>
This masterful analogy was created by Bertrand Russell. In<br>
this case, the mountain is the sun, the travelers are the<br>
planets, asteroids, comets (and debris from the space program),<br>the footpaths are their orbits, and the coming of daylight is<br>the coming of Einstein's general theory of relativity.<br>
The point is that the objects in the solar system move as<br>
they do not because of some mysterious force (gravity) exerted<br>upon them at a distance by the sun, but because of the nature<br>of the neighborhood through which they are traveling.<br>
Arthur Eddington illustrated this same situation in another<br>
way. Suppose, he suggested, that we are in a boat looking<br>down into clear water. We can see the sand on the bottom<br>and the fishes swimming beneath us. As we watch, we notice<br>that the fish seem to be repelled from a certain point. As-they<br>approach it, they swim either to the right or to the left of it,<br>but never over it. From this we probably would deduce that<br>there is a repellant force at that point which keeps the fish<br>away.<br>
However, if we should go into the water to get a closer<br>

fish found easier to swim around than to swim ovei<br>
The movement of the fish was determined not by a force<br>
emanating from the<i> my</i> stenous spot, but bv the nature of the<br>neighborhood through which they were passing (Eddmgton's<br>
sunfish was called &quot;Albert') (really) If we could see the geog-<br>raphy (the geometry) of the space-time continuum, we would<br>see that,<br>
 it, and not &quot;forces between objects,&quot; is the<br>
reason that planets move in the ways that thev do<br>
It is not possible for us<br>
 to see the geometiv of the<br>
space-time continuum because it is foui-dimensional and our<br>sensory experience is limited to three dimensions For that<br>reason, it is not even possible to picture it<br>
For example, suppose that there existed a world of two-<br>
dimensional people Such a world would look like a picture on a<br>television or a movie screen The people and the objects in a<br>
two-dimensional world would have height and width, but not<br>depth H these two-dimensional figures had a life and an intel-<br>ligence of their own, their world would appear quite different<br>to them than our world appears to us for they could not<br>experience the third dimension<br>
A straight line drawn between two of these people would<br>
appear to them as a wall They would be able to walk around<br>either end of it, but they would not be able to &quot;step over' it,<br>because their physical existence is limited to two dimensions<br>They cannot step off the screen into the thud dimension<br>They would know what a circle is, but there is no way that<br>
they could know what a sphere is In fact, a sphere would<br>appear to them as a circle<br>
If they like to explore, they soon would discover that their<br>
world is flat and infinite If two of them went off in opposite<br>directions they would never meet<br>
They also could create a simple geometry Sooner or later<br>
they would generah/e their experiences into abstractions to<br>help them do and build the things that the&gt; want to do and<br>build in their physical world For example, they would discover<br>that whenever three straight metal bars form a triangle, the<br>

angles of the triangle always total 180 degrees Sooner or<br>later, the more perceptive among them would substitute men-<br>tal idealizations (straight lines) for the metal bars That would<br>allow them to arrive at the abstract conclusion that a triangle,<br>
which by definition is formed by three straight lines, always<br>contains 180 degrees To learn more about triangles, they no<br>longer would need actually to construct them<br>
The geometry that such a two-dimensional people would<br>
create is the same geometry that we studied in school It is<br>called Euclidean geometry, in honor of the Greek, Euclid,<br>whose thoughts on the subject were so thorough that no one<br>expanded on them for nearly two thousand vears (The content<br>of most high-school geometry books is about two millennia<br>old)<br>
Now let us suppose that someone, unbeknownst to them,<br>
transported these two-dimensional people from their flat world<br>onto the surface of an enormously large sphere This means<br>that instead of being<br>
 flat, their physical world now<br>
would be somewhat curved At first, no one would notice the<br>difference However, if their technology improved enough to<br>allow them to begin to travel and to communicate over great<br>distances these people eventually would make a remarkable<br>
discovery They would discover that their geometry could<br>not be verified in their physical world<br>
For example, they would discover that if they surveyed a<br>
large enough triangle and measured the angles that form it, it<br>would have more than 180 degrees' This is a simple phenom-<br>enon for<i> us</i> to picture Imagine a triangle drawn on a globe<br>
The apex (top) of the triangle is at the north pole The two<br>lines intersecting there form a right angle The equator is the<br>base of the triangle Look what happens Both sides of the<br>triangle, upon intersecting the equator, also form right an-<br>gles According to Euclidean geometry, a triangle contains<br>only two right angles (180 degrees), yet this triangle contains<br><i>three</i> right angles (270 degrees)<br>
Remember that in our example, the two-dimensional peo-<br>
ple actually have surveyed a triangle on what they presumed<br>
was their flat world, measured the angles, and come up with<br>270 degrees What a confusion When the dust settles they<br>would realize that there are only two possible explanations<br>
The first possible explanation is that the straight lines used<br>
to construct the triangle (like light beams) were not actually<br>straight, although they seemed to be straight This could ac-<br>

count for the excessive number of degrees in the triangle.<br>However, if this is the explanation that they choose to adopt,<br>then they must create a &quot;force&quot; responsible for somehow<br>
distorting the straight lines (like &quot;gravity&quot;). The second possible<br>explanation is that their abstract geometry does not apply to<br>their real world. This is another way of saying that, impossible<br>as it sounds, their universe is not Euclidean.<br>
The idea that their physical reality is not Euclidean probably<br>
would sound so fantastic to them (especially if they had had<br>no reason to question the reality of Euclidean geometry for<br>two thousand years) that they probably would choose to look<br>for forces responsible for distorting their straight lines. *<br>
The problem is that, having chosen this course, they would<br>
be obligated to create a responsible force every time that<br>their physical world failed to validate Euclidean geometry.<br>Eventually the structure of these necessary forces would be-<br>come so complex that it would be much simpler to forget<br>them altogether and admit that their physical world does not<br>follow the logically irrefutable rules of Euclidean geometry.<br>
Our situation is parallel to that of the two-dimensional peo-<br>
ple who cannot perceive, but who can deduce that they are<br>living in a three-dimensional world. We are a three-dimensional<br>people who cannot perceive, but who can deduce that we are<br>living in a four-dimensional universe.<br>
For two thousand years we have assumed that the entire<br>
physical universe, like the geometry that the ancient Greeks<br>created from their experience with this part of it, was Euclidean.<br>That the geometry of Euclid is universally valid means that it<br>can be verified anywhere in the physical world. That assumption<br>
was wrong. Einstein was the first person to see that the universe<br>is not bound by the rules of Euclidean geometry, even though<br>our minds tenaciously cling to the idea that it is.<br>
Although we cannot perceive the four-dimensional space-<br>
time continuum directly, we can deduce from what we already<br>know of the special theory of relativity that our universe is not<br>Euclidean. Here is another of Einstein's thought experiments.<br>

one with a very large radius. Both of them revolve around a<br>
common center as shown.<br>
Imagine also that we, the observers, are watching these<br>
revolving circles from an inertial co-ordinate system. Being in<br>an inertial co-ordinate system simply means that our frame of<br>reference is at rest relative to everything, including the<br>
revolving circles. Drawn over the revolving circles are two<br>identical concentric circles which are in our co-ordinate system.<br>
They are not revolving. They are the same size as the revolving<br>circles and have the same common center, but they remain<br>motionless. While we and our non-revolving circles are mo-<br>tionless, we are in communication with an observer who is on<br>the revolving circles. He actually is going around with them.<br>
According to Euclidean geometry, the ratio of the radius to<br>
the circumference of all circles is the same. If we measure the<br>radius and the circumference of the small circle, for example,<br>the ratio of these two measurements will be the same as the<br>ratio of the radius to the circumference of the large circle.<br>
The object of this thought experiment is to determine whether<br>this is true or not for both the observers on the stationary<br>circles (us) and the observer on the revolving circles. If the<br>geometry of Euclid is valid throughout the physical universe,<br>as it should be, we should discover that the ratio between the<br>

<IMG src="dancingmasters-192_2.png"><br>
174 / NONSENSE<br>
radius and the circumference of<i> all</i> the circles involved is<br>identical.<br>
Both we and the observer on the revolving circles will use<br>
the same ruler to do our measuring. &quot;The same ruler&quot; means<br>that either we actually hand him the same ruler that we have<br>used, or that we use rulers that have the same length when at<br>rest in the same co-ordinate system.<br>
We go first. Using our ruler, we measure the radius of our<br>
small circle, and then we measure the circumference of our<br>small circle. Then we note the ratio between them. The next<br>step is to measure the radius of our large circle and then the<br>circumference of our large circle. Then we note the ratio<br>between them. Yes, it is the same ratio that we found be-<br>tween the radius and the circumference of our small circle.<br>We have proved that Euclidean geometry is valid in our co-<br>
ordinate system, which is an inertial co-ordinate system.<br>
Now we hand the ruler to the observer on the revolving<br>
circles as he passes by us. Using this ruler he first measures<br>the radius of his small circle and finds that it is the same as<br>ours, since our circles are drawn directly over his circles.<br>Next he measures the circumference of his small circle. Re-<br>member that motion causes rulers to contract in the direction<br>that they are moving. However, since the radius of the small<br>
circle is so short, the velocity of the ruler when it is placed on<br>the circumference of the small circle is not fast<br>
 to<br>
make the effect of relativistic contraction noticeable. Therefore,<br>the observer on the revolving circles measures the circumfer-<br>ence of his small circle and finds it to be the same as the<br>circumference of our small circle. Naturally, the ratio between<br>them also is the same. So far so good. The ratios between the<br>radius and the circumference of three circles have been de-<br>
termined (our small circle, our large circle, and his small<br>circle) and they all are identical. This is exactly what should<br>happen according to high-school geometry books across the<br>country. Only one more circle to go.<br>
The observer on the revolving circles measures the radius<br>
of his large circle and finds it to be the same length as the<br>radius of our large circle. Now he comes to the last measure-<br>ment, the circumference of his large circle. However, as soon<br>as he puts his ruler into position to make a measurement on<br>the circumference of the large revolving circle, his ruler con-<br>
tracts! Because the radius of his large circle is much larger than<br>
<hr>
<A name=193></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-193_1.png"><br>
GENERAL NONSENSE / 175<br>
the radius of his small circle, the velocity of the circumference<br>of the large revolving circle is considerably faster than the<br>
velocity of the circumference of the small revolving circle.<br>
Since the ruler must be aligned in the direction that the<br>
circumference is moving, it becomes shorter. When the<br>revolving observer uses this ruler to measure the circumfer-<br>ence of the large revolving circle, he finds that it is larger<br>than the circumference of our large circle. This is because his<br>ruler is shorter (Contraction also affected his ruler when he<br>measured the radius of his large circle, but since it then was<br>
placed perpendicular to the direction of motion, it became<br>skinnier, not shorter).<br>
This means that the ratio of the radius to the circumference<br>
of the small revolving circle is not the same as the ratio of the<br>radius to the circumference of the large revolving circle. Ac-<br>cording to Euclidean geometry, this is not possible, but there<br>it is.<br>
If we want to be old-fashioned about it (before-Einstein) we<br>
can say that this situation is nothing unusual. By definition,<br>the laws of mechanics and the geometry of Euclid are valid<br>only in inertial systems (that is what makes them inertial<br>systems). We simply don't consider co-ordinate systems which<br>are not inertial. (This was really the position of physicists before<br>Albert Einstein). This is exactly what seemed wrong to Einstein.<br>His idea was to create a physics valid for<i> all</i> co-ordinate systems,<br>since the universe abounds with the non-inertial as well as the<br>inertia] kind.<br>
If we are to create such a universally valid physics, a gen-<br>
eral physics, then we must treat both the observers in the<br>stationary (inertial) system and the observer on the revolving<br>circles (a non-inertial system) with equal seriousness. The per-<br>son on the revolving circles has as much right to relate the<br>physical world to his frame of reference as we have to relate it<br>
to ours. True, the laws of mechanics as well as the geometry<br>of Euclid are not valid in his frame of reference, but every<br>deviation from them can be explained in terms of a gravitational<br>field which affects his frame of reference.<br>
This is what Einstein's theory allows us to do. It allows us<br>
to express the laws of physics in such a way that they are<br>independent of specific space-time co-ordinates. Space and<br>time co-ordinates (measurements) vary from one frame of<br>
reference to another, depending upon the state of motion of<br>
<hr>
<A name=194></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-194_1.png"><br>
176 / NONSENSE<br>
the frame of reference. The general theory of relativity allows<br>us to universalize the laws of physics and to apply them to all<br>frames of reference.<br>
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; we say, &quot;how can anyone measure distance<br>
or navigate in a co-ordinate system like the one on the revolving<br>circles. The length of a ruler varies from place to place in such<br>a system. The farther we go from the center, the faster the<br>velocity of the ruler, and the more it contracts. This doesn't<br>happen in an inertial co-ordinate system, which, in effect, is a<br>system that is at rest. Because there is no change of velocity<br>throughout an inerHal co-ordinate system, rulers do not change<br>length.<br>
&quot;This allows us to organize inertial systems like a city, block<br>
by block. Since rulers do not change length in inertial systems,<br>all the blocks that are laid out with the same ruler will be the<br>same length. No matter where we travel, we know that ten<br>blocks is twice the distance of five blocks.<br>
&quot;In a non-inertial system the velocity of the system varies<br>
from place to place. This means that the length of a ruler<br>varies from place to place. If we used the same ruler to lay<br>out all the city blocks in a non-inertial co-ordinate system,<br>some of them would be larger than others depending upon<br>where they were located.&quot;<br>
&quot;What is wrong with that,&quot; asks Jim de Wit, &quot;as long as we<br>
still can determine our position in the co-ordinate system.<br>Imagine a sheet of india rubber on which we have drawn a<br>grid so that it looks like a piece of graph paper (first drawing,<br>opposite page). This is a co-ordinate system. Assuming that<br>
we are at the lower left corner (we can start anywhere) let us<br>
say that a party Saturday night is being held at the intersec-<br>tion marked 'Party.' To get there we have to go two squares to<br>the right and two squares up.<br>
&quot;Now suppose that we stretch the sheet of rubber so that it<br>
looks like the second drawing.&quot;<br>
The same directions (two squares right and two squares up)<br>
still bring us to the party. The only difference is that unless<br>
we are familiar with this part of the co-ordinate system, we<br>cannot calculate the distance that we have to travel as easily<br>as we could if all of the squares were the same size.&quot;<br>
According to the general theory of relativity, gravity, which<br>
is the equivalent of acceleration, is what distorts the space-<br>
time continuum in a manner analogous to our stretching the<br>

sheet of rubber. Where the effects of gravity can be neglected,<br>the space-time continuum is like the sheet of rubber before<br>we stretched it. All of the lines are straight lines and all of the<br>clocks are synchronized. In other words, the undistorted sheet<br>of rubber is analogous to the space-time continuum of an<br>inertial co-ordinate system and the special theory of relativity<br>applies.<br>
However, in the universe at large gravity eannot be ne-<br>
glected. Wherever there is a piece of matter, it warps the<br>space-time continuum. The larger the piece of matter, the<br>more pronounced the warp.<br>
In the example of the revolving circles, the variation of<br>
velocity in different parts of the co-ordinate system caused the<br>ruler to change size. With that in mind, remember that<i> accel-<br>eration (change in velocity) is the equivalent of gravity.</i><br>
Therefore, changes in the strength of a gravitational field will<br>produce the same contractions of the ruler as changes in<br>velocity. &quot;Acceleration&quot; and &quot;gravity&quot; are two ways of saying<br>the same thing. That means that if a ruler is subjected to<br>gravitational fields of different strength, it changes length.<br>

Of course, it is impossible to travel through our solar system,<br>
much less our galaxy, without encountering gravitational fields<br>
of varying intensity, which would cause any maps that we<br>somehow could produce to look distorted like the stretched<br>piece of india rubber The terrain of the space-time contin-<br>uum in which our earth moves is like a hillv countryside with<br>a mountain (the sun) dominating the geography<br>
According to Newton, the earth wants to continue forever<br>
in a straight line, but forever is deflected from its inclination<br>by the gravitational force of the sun A balance of the two<br>keeps the earth in orbit around the sun According to Einstein,<br>the earth's orbit is simpl&gt; the easiest path for the earth to take<br>as it moves through the space-time continuum, warped as it is<br>in this neighborhood by the sun<br>
Imagine how complex is the geography of the space-time<br>
continuum which is our universe with its solar systems, star<br>systems, galaxies, and galax&gt; clusters, each of them causing<br>major and minor bumps, curves hills, valleys, and mountains<br>in the four-dimensional space-time continuum<br>
Would it be possible to navigate under such<br>Yes Although it is a crude example, sailors navigate under<br>
somewhat analogous circumstances We cover the earth with<br>squares which are formed by lines of latitude and longitude<br>
The size of these squares varies depending upon where they<br>are located The closer thev are to the equator, the larger<br>they are (If this is unclear, look at a globe) Nonetheless, we<br>still can locate physical points on the surface of the earth by<br>designating the intersection of a line of latitude and a line of<br>longitude Knowing the number of squares between us and<br>where we want to sail does not give us the distance to our<br>destination because the squares may vary in size However, if<br>
we know the nature of our terrain (a globe) we can calculate<br>distances on it (using spherical trigonometry)<br>
Similarly, once we know the properties of an area of the<br>
space-time continuum (by exploring it) we can determine not<br>only the position of, but also the distance (interval) between<br>two events in the space-time continuum * The mathematical<br>
structure of the general theory of relativity, which Einstein<br>
created over a period of ten vears, permits us to do just that<br>

poetry, or blank verse, but it is not physics The question is,<br>does Einstein's fantastic theory really work?<br>
The answer is a slightly tentative, but generally accepted<br>
&quot;Yes ' Most physicists agree that the general theory of relativity<br>is a valid way of viewing large-scale phenomena, and at the<br>same time, most physicists still are eager to see more evidence<br>to confirm (or challenge) this position<br>
Since the general theory of relativity deals with vast expanses<br>
of the universe, its proof (of usefulness, not of &quot;truth&quot;—the<br>watch is still unopenable) cannot come from observations of<br>phenomena limited to the earth For this reason, its verifications<br>
come from astronomy<br>
Thus far, the general theory of relativity has been verified<br>
in four ways The first three ways are straightforward and<br>
convincing The last<br>
 if early observations are correct,<br>
may be more fantastic than the theory itself<br>
The first verification of the general theory of relativity came<br>
as an unexpected benefit to astronomers<br>
 law of<br>
gravity purported to describe the orbits of the planets around<br>the sun, and it did—all of them except Mercury Mercury<br>orbits the sun in such a way that some parts of its orbit bring<br>it closer to the sun than others The part of Mercury's orbit<br>closest to the sun is called its perihelion The first verification<br>of Einstein s general theory of relativity turned out to be the<br>long-sought explanation of the problem of Mercury s perihelion<br>
The problem with Mercury s perihelion—in fact, with Mer-<br>
cury's entire orbit—is that it moves Instead of continuously<br>retracing its path around the sun relative to a co-ordinate<br>system attached to the sun, Mercury's orbit itself revolves<br>around the sun The rate of revolution is extremely slow (it<br>completes one revolution around the sun every three million<br>
years) This still was enough to<br>
 astronomers Prior to<br>
Einstein, this precession in Mercury's orbit had been attributed<br>to an undiscovered planet in our solar system By the time<br>Einstein published his general theory of relatmty, the search<br>
for this mysterious planet was well underway<br>
Einstein created his general theory of relativity without<br>
special attention to the perihelion of Mercurv However, when<br>the general theory of relativity was applied to this problem, it<br>showed that Mercury moves precisely as Mercury has to move<br>

According to Einstein, the presence of the sun between a<br>

the sun. Because we assume that starlight travels in a straight<br>line, we assume that the star is in a position other than it<br>actually is.<br>
Although light was supposed to travel in a straight line in a<br>
vacuum, a certain amount of bending already was theorized<br>before Einstein's general theory of relativity. Newton's law of<br>gravity was used to calculate this bending, even though it<br>could not explain it. Einstein's theory predicted roughly<i> twice<br></i>the deflection that Newton's law predicted, and, in addition,<br>it supplied an explanation for it. Physicists and astronomers<br>
alike eagerly awaited the outcome of this confrontation be-<br>tween the new theory and the old.<br>
The 1919 eclipse was photographed by two different expedi-<br>
tions sent to two<br>
 parts of the world. These expeditions<br>
also took photographs of the same stellar background at times<br>when the sun was not in the area. The results of both<br>expeditions vindicated Einstein's calculations, not Newton's.<br>
Since 1919, the same verdict has been reached again and<br>
again during other eclipses. All of them confirm Einstein's<br>predictions. Score two for the general theory.<br>
The third verification of the general theory of relativity is<br>
called gravitational redshift. Bemember that gravity (because<br>

it is the equivalent of acceleration) not only causes rulers to<br>contract, but it also causes clocks to run more slowly.<br>
A clock is anything that repeats itself periodically. An atom<br>
is a type of clock. It vibrates at a certain frequency. When a<br>
substance, like sodium, is made to glow, the wavelength of<br>the light that it emits can be measured accurately. This<br>
wavelength tells us exactly the frequency of the vibrations of<br>the atoms that comprise the substance. If the frequency should<br>vary, the wavelength also will vary.<br>
If we want to compare the rhythm of a clock here on the<br>
earth with the rhythm of a clock that is influenced by an<br>intense gravitational field, like that of the sun, we do not need<br>to send a clock to the surface of the sun. The clocks already<br>are in place.<br>
Einstein predicted that any periodic process that takes place<br>
in an atom on the sun, where the gravity is very intense, must<br>take place at a slightly slower rate than it does here on the<br>earth. To test this prediction, all we need do is compare the<br>
wavelength of the radiation of a given element as it is found in<br>sunlight and as it is found here on earth in the laboratory.<br>This has been done many times. In each case, the wavelength<br>measured from the sunlight was found to be longer than its<br>laboratory counterpart. A longer wavelength means a lower<br>(slower) frequency. Sodium atoms, for example, vibrate more<br>slowly under the influence of the sun's strong gravitational<br>
field than they do on the earth. So do all the atoms.<br>
This phenomenon is called gravitational redshift because<br>
the wavelengths involved appear to be shifted slightly toward<br>the red end of the visible light spectnim where the wavelengths<br>are the longest. Score three for the general theory.<br>
Mercury's moving perihelion, starlight deflection, and<br>
gravitational redshift are all observable phenomena. Now we<br>come to an area where theory is still predominant and obser-<br>vation is minimal. Nonetheless, it is an area that is by far the<br>most exciting and perhaps the most stimulating in the entire<br>history of science. The fourth verification of the general theory<br>of relativity appears to be the phenomenon of the black hole.<br>
In 1958, David Finkelstein published a paper in which he<br>
theorized, on the basis of Einstein's general theory of relativity,<br>a phenomenon that he called a &quot;one-way membrane.&quot;4 Finkel-<br>stein showed that under certain conditions involving an<br>extremely dense gravitational field, an invisible threshold can<br>

occur into which light and physical objects can enter, but<br>from which they never again can escape.*<br>
The following year, a young graduate student at the Uni-<br>
versity of London heard Finkelstein, who was speaking there<br>as a guest lecturer, explain his one-way membrane. The idea<br>caught his attention and then his imagination. The young<br>student was Roger Penrose. Expanding on Finkelstein's<br>
discovery, he developed it into the modern theory of the<br>&quot;Black Hole.&quot;t<br>
A black hole is an area of space which appears absolutely<br>
black because the gravitation there is so intense that not even<br>light can escape into the surrounding areas.tt Gravitation is<br>negligible on the laboratory level, but quite important when<br>bodies of large mass are concerned. Therefore, the exploration<br>of black holes naturally became a joint venture of physicists<br>and astronomers.<br>
Astronomers speculated that a black hole may be one of<br>
several possible products of stellar evolution. Stars do not<br>burn indefinitely. They evolve through a life cycle which begins<br>
with hydrogen gas and sometimes ends with a very dense,<br>burned-out, rotating mass. The exact end product of this proc-<br>ess depends upon the size of the star undergoing it. Accord-<br>ing to one theory, stars which are about three times the size<br>of our sun or larger end up as black holes. The remains of<br>
such stars are unimaginably dense. They may be only a few<br>miles in diameter and yet contain the entire mass of a star<br>three times larger than the sun. Such a dense mass produces<br>a gravitational field strong enough to pull everything in its<br>vicinity into it, while at the same time allowing nothing, not<br>even light, to escape from it.<br>
Surrounding this remainder of a star is an &quot;even horizon.'<br>
An even horizon is created by the enormous gravitational<br>field of the burned-out star. It functions percisely like Finkel-<br>
*This pi<br>
 was theorized by Pierre-Simon La Place in 1795 using<br>
Newtonia i physics. Finkelstein was the first physicist to formulate it from the<br>modern point of view, i.e., relativity theorv. This modern formulation triggered<br>the<br>
t theories on the black hole.<br>
'The ver<br>
first modern paper on black holes was done b\ J. R. Oppenheimer<br>
and S. Si vder in 1939. The current theories of the black hole, i.e., black hole<br>singularit es which are be\ond space-time, were developed<br>

 a first approximation. Physicists<br>
 theorize that black holes<br>
shine due to photons and other particles quantum-tunneling out of the<br>membranes.<br>

stein's one-way membrane. Anything within the gravitational<br>
field of this mass quickly is pulled toward it, and once past the<br>event horizon, never can return. It is the event horizon which<br>constitutes the essential feature of the black hole. What hap-<br>pens to an object that passes through an event horizon is even<br>more fantastic than the wildest (currently) science fiction.<br>
If the black hole is not rotating, the object will be pulled<br>
directly to the center of the black hole t-j a point called the<br>singularity. There it literally will be squeezed out of existence,<br>or as physicists say, to zero volume. At the black hole singularity<br>all of the laws of physics break down completely, and even<br>space and time disappear. It is speculated that everything<br>which is sucked into a black hole is spilled out again on &quot;the<br>other side&quot;—the &quot;other side&quot; being another universe!<br>
If the black hole is rotating, an object that is sucked into<br>
the event horizon could miss the black hole singularity (which<br>is shaped like a &quot;ring&quot; in a rotating black hole) and emerge<br>into another time and another place in this universe (through<br>&quot;wormholes&quot;), or into another universe (through &quot;Einstein-<br>Rosen bridges ). In this way, rotating black holes may be the<br>ultimate time machines.<br>
Although black holes are almost invisible, we can search for<br>
observable phenomena that may be characteristic of them.<br>The first of these is a large amount of electromagnetic radiation.<br>A black hole continuously attracts hydrogen atoms, cosmic<br>particles, and everything else to it. As these particles and<br>objects are drawn to the black hole, they steadily accelerate<br>through its gravitational field until they approach the velocity<br>of light itself. This causes tremendous amounts of electro-<br>magnetic radiation. (Any accelerating charged particle creates<br>electromagnetic radiation).<br>
The second observable characteristic of an invisible black<br>
hole is its effect on a nearby visible star. If a visible star can<br>be found which moves as though it were revolving around an<br>invisible star (i.e., as though it were half of a binary star sys-<br>tem), we might speculate that it actually<i> is</i> revolving around an<br>invisible star, and that its invisible partner is a black hole.<br>
The search for black holes consequently became the search<br>
for these two phenomena. In 1970, the satellite Uhuru lo-<br>cated both of them in one area. It pinpointed a high-energy<br>x-ray source in the constellation Cygnus which emits a mil-<br>lion times more energy than the sun. This high-energy source<br>of electromagnetic radiation, which came to be known as<br>

Cygnus X-1 is very close to a visible blue-hot<br>
 star<br>
Scientists now believe that this blue supergiant forms a binary<br>
system with the black hole Cygnus X-1<br>
As the visible star and the invisible black hole orbit each<br>
other, the blue supergiant literally is being sucked into the<br>black hole As material is torn away from its surface, it plunges<br>into the black hole at tremendous speed, emitting x-rays<br>Incredible as Cygnus X-1 is, more than one hundred similar<br>objects have been detected within our own Milky Way galaxy<br>since its discovery Although black holes stretch our imagina-<br>tion to the limit, the evidence is mounting that they actually<br>do exist<br>
For example, if black holes are as we have speculated them<br>
to be, whatever disappears into them reappears somewhere<br>Is it possible, therefore, that there are black holes in other<br>universes which are sucking matter from those universes into<br>
our<br>
 This is a seriously considered possibility There<br>
are objects in our universe that appear to be the reverse of<br>black holes They are called white holes (of course) These<br>objects are quasi-stellar radio sources, or quasars for short<br>
Quasars are extraordinarily intense energy sources Most of<br>
them are only several times the diameter of our solar system,<br>
yet they emit more energy than an entire galaxy of over 150<br>billion stars' Some astronomers believe that quasars are the<br>
most distant objects ever detected, yet their incredible<br>
brightness allows us to see them clearly<br>
The relationship between black holes and quasars is purely<br>
speculation but the speculation is mind-boggling For example,<br>some physicists speculate that black holes swallow up matter<br>from one universe and pump it either into another universe<br>or into another part and time of the same universe The<br>
output side of a black hole according to this hypothesis, is a<br>
quasar If this speculation is correct, then our universe is<br>being sucked into its many black holes, only to reappear in<br>
other universes, while other universes are being pumped into<br>our own universe which is being sucked through black holes<br>and into other universes again The process goes on and on,<br>feeding on itself, another begmnmgless, endless, endless,<br>begmnmgless dance<br>
One of the most profound by-products of the general theory<br>
of relativity is the discovery that gravitational &quot;force,&quot; which<br>
we had so long taken to be a real and independently existing<br>

The Particle Zoo<br>
The fourth translation of Wu Li is &quot;I Clutch My Ideas.&quot; This<br>is appropriate to a book on physics since the history of science<br>in general often has been the story of scientists vigorously<br>fighting an onslaught of new ideas. This is because it is diffi-<br>
cult to relinquish the sense of security that conies from a long<br>and rewarding acquaintance with a particular world view.<br>
The value of a physical theory depends upon its usefulness.<br>
In this sense the history of physical theories might be said to<br>resemble the history of individual personality traits. Most of<br>us respond to our environment with a collection of automatic<br>responses that once brought desirable results, usually in child-<br>hood. Unfortunately, if the environment that produced these<br>
responses changes (we grow up) and the responses themselves<br>do not adapt, they become counterproductive. Showing anger,<br>becoming depressed, flattering, crying, and bullying behavior<br>are response patterns appropriate to times often long past.<br>
These patterns change only when we are forced to realize that<br>they are no longer productive. Even then change is often<br>painful and slow. The same is true of scientific<br>
Not one person, except Copernicus, wanted to accept the<br>
Copernican idea that the earth revolves around the sun. Goethe<br>wrote about the Copernican revolution:<br>
Perhaps a greater demand has never been laid upon man-<br>kind; for by this admission[that the earth is not the center<br>of the universe], how much else did not collapse in dust<br>and smoke: a second paradise, a world of innocence,<br>poetry, and piety, the witness of the senses, the convic-<br>

tions of a poetic and religious faith; no wonder that men<br>had no stomach for all this, that they ranged themselves<br>in every way against such a doctrine . .<br>
Not one physicist, not even Planck himself, wanted to accept<br>
the implications of Planck's discovery, for to do so threatened<br>a scientific structure (Newtonian physics) over three hundred<br>years old. Heisenberg wrote about the quantum revolution:<br>
. . . when new groups of phenomena compel changes in<br>the pattern of thought . . . even the most eminent of<br>physicists find immense difficulties. For the demand for<br>
change in the thought pattern may engender the feeling<br>that the ground is to be pulled from under one's feet. . . .<br>
I believe that the difficulties at this point can hardly be<br>overestimated. Once one has experienced the despera-<br>tion with which clever and conciliatory men of science<br>react to the demand for a change in the thought pattern,<br>one can only be amazed that such revolutions in science<br>have actually been possible at all.2<br>
Scientific revolutions are forced upon us by the discovery of<br>
phenomena that are not comprehensible in terms of the old<br>theories. Old theories die hard. Much more is at stake than<br>the theories themselves. To give up our privileged position at<br>the center of the universe, as Copernicus asked, was an<br>enormous psychological task. To accept that nature is funda-<br>mentally irrational (governed by chance), which is the essential<br>statement of quantum mechanics, is a powerful blow to the<br>intellect. Nonetheless, as new theories demonstrate superior<br>utility, their adversaries, however reluctantly, have little choice<br>but to accept them. In so doing, they also must grant a meas-<br>ure of recognition to the world views that accompany them.<br>
Today, particle accelerators, bubble chambers and computer<br>
printouts are giving birth to another world view. This world<br>view is as different from the world view at the beginning of<br>this century as the Copernican world view was from its<br>predecessors. It calls upon us to relinquish many of our closely<br>clutched ideas.<br>
In this world view there is no substance.<br>
The most common question that we can ask about an object<br>
is, &quot;What is it made of?&quot; That question, however, &quot;What is it<br>made of?&quot;, is based upon an artifical mental structure that is<br>much like a hall of mirrors. If we stand directly between two<br>

mirrors and look into one, we see our reflection, and, just<br>behind ourselves, we see a crowd of &quot;us&quot;s, each looking at the<br>back of the head in front of it, stretching backward as far as<br>we can see. These reflections, all of them, are illusions. The<br>only real thing in the whole setting is<i> us (we).</i><br>
This situation is very similar to what happens whenever we<br>
ask of something, &quot;What is it made of?&quot; The answer to such a<br>question is always another something to which we can apply<br>the same question.<br>
Suppose, for example, that we ask of an ordinary toothpick,<br>
&quot;What is it made of?&quot; The answer, of course, is &quot;wood.&quot; How-<br>ever, the question itself has taken us into a hall of mirrors<br>because now we can ask about the wood, &quot;What is it made<br>of?&quot; Closer examination reveals that wood is made of fibers,<br>uut what the fibers are made of is another question, and so<br>on.<br>
Like a pair of parallel mirrors, reflecting reflections, gives<br>
the illusion of an unending progression to nowhere, the idea<br>that a thing can be different from what it is made of creates an<br>infinite progression of answers, leaving us forever frustrated<br>in an unending search. No matter what something—anything<br>
—is &quot;made of, we have created an illusion which forces us to<br>
ask, &quot;Yes, but what is<i> that</i> made of?&quot;<br>
Physicists are people who have pursued tenaciously this<br>
endless series of questions. What they have found is startling.<br>Wood fibers, to continue the example, are actually patterns of<br>cells. Cells, under magnification, are revealed to be patterns<br>of molecules. Molecules, under higher magnification, are<br>discovered to be patterns of atoms, and, lastly, atoms have<br>turned out to be patterns of subatomic particles. In other<br>
words, &quot;matter&quot; is actually a series of<i> patterns out of focus.<br></i>The search for the ultimate stuff of the universe ends with the<br>discovery that there<i> isn't any.</i><br>
If there is any ultimate stuff of the universe, it is pure<br>
energy, but subatomic particles are not &quot;made of energy,<br>they<i> are</i> energy. This is what Einstein theorized in 1905.<br>Subatomic interactions, therefore, are interactions of energy<br>
with energy. At the subatomic level there is no longer a clear<br>distinction between what is and what happens, between the<br>actor and the action. At the subatomic level the dancer and<br>
the dance are one.<br>
According to particle physics, the world is fundamentally<br>
dancing energy; energy that is everywhere and incessantly<br>

Where there was nothing there suddenly is something<br>
and then the something is gone again often changing into<br>something else before vanishing In particle physics there is<br>no distinction between empty as in empty space and not<br>
 or between something and not-something The world<br>
of particle physics is a world of sparkling energy forever danc<br>mg with itself in the form of its particles as they twinkle in<br>and out of existence collide transmute and disappear again<br>
The<br>
 view of particle physics is a picture of<i> chaos</i><br>
<i>beneath order</i> At the fundamental level is a confusion of<br>continual creation annihilation and transformation Above this<br>confusion limiting the forms that it can take are a set of<br>conservation laws (page 156) They do not specify what must<br>happen as ordinary laws of physics do rather they specify<br>what<br>
 happen They are permissive laws At the<br>
subatomic level absolutely everything that is not forbidden<br>by the conservation laws actually happens (Quantum theory<br>

This elaborate arrangement is necessary because most par-<br>
ticles live much less than a millionth of a second and are too<br>small to be observed directly, t In general, everything a parti-<br>cle physicist knows about subatomic particles, he deduces<br>from his theories and from photographs of the tracks that<br>particles leave in a bubble chamber, tt<br>
Bubble chamber photographs, thousands and thousands of<br>
them, show clearly the frustrating situation which early parti-<br>cle physicists encountered in their search for &quot;elementary&quot;<br>particles. When the projectile strikes the target, both parti-<br>
cles are destroyed at the point of impact. In their place, how-<br>ever, are created<i> new</i> particles, all of which are as &quot;elementary&quot;<br>as the original particles and often as massive as the original<br>particles!<br>
( THE SAME ! )-<br>
The schematic diagram above shows a typical particle inter-<br>
action. A particle called a negative pi meson (IT&quot;) collides with a<br>proton (p). Both the pie meson and the proton are destroyed<br>and in their place are created two new particles, a neutral K<br>meson (K°) and a lambda particle (A). Both of these particles<br>decay spontaneously (no collision necessary) into two additional<br>particles, leaving four new particles. Of these four particles,<br>two of them are the same particles that we started with! It is<br>as though, wrote Finkelstein, we fling two clocks together,<br>they shatter, and out of them come flying not gears and springs<br>but more clocks, some of them as large as the originals.<br>
How can this happen? The answer is partly given by<br>
t The<br>
 eye can detect single photons. All of the other subatomic<br>
particles must be detected indirectly.<br>tt In addition to bubble-chamber physics there is emulsion {photographic plate)<br>physics, counter physics, etc. However, the bubble chamber is probably the<br>most commonly used detection device in particle physics.<br>

beheld &quot;the face of God&quot; speak in terms so similar to these<br>that any psychologist who professes an interest in altered states<br>of awareness scarcely can ignore this obvious bridge between<br>the disciplines of physics and psychology.<br>
The first question of particle physics is, &quot;What collides?&quot;<br>According to quantum mechanics, a subatomic particle is<br>
not a particle like a particle of dust. Rather, subatomic parti-<br>cles are &quot;tendencies to exist' (page 32) and &quot;correlations be-<br>tween macroscopic observables&quot; (page 70). They have no<br>objective existence. That means that we cannot assume, if we<br>are to use quantum theory, that particles have an existence<br>apart from their interactions with a measuring device (page<br>
95). As Heisenberg wrote:<br>
In the light of the quantum theory . . . elementary parti-<br>cles are no longer real in the same sense as objects of<br>
daily life, trees or stones . . .4<br>
* The mass/energy dualism of our ordinary conceptualizations does not exist in<br>the formalism of relativity or quantum theory. According to Einstein's E = me2,<br>mass does not change into energy or vice versa: Energy is mass. Wherever<br>
energy, E, is present, mass, m, is present and the amount of mass, m, is given<br>by E = me2. The total amount of energy. E, is conserved, and hence the total<br>amount of mass, m, also is conserved. This mass, m, is defined by the fact that<br>it is a source of the gravitational field.<br>

When an electron, for example, passes through a photo-<br>
graphic plate it leaves a visible &quot;track&quot; behind it This &quot;track,&quot;<br>under close examination, is actually a series of dots Each dot<br>is a grain of silver formed by the electron's interaction with<br>atoms in the photographic plate When we look at the track<br>under a microscope, it looks something like this<br>
Ordinarily we would assume that one and the same electron,<br>
like a little baseball, went streaking through the photographic<br>plate and left this trail of silver grains behind it This is a<br>mistake Quantum mechanics tells us the same thing that<br>Tan trie Buddhists have been saying for a millenium<i> The con-<br>nection between the dots (the moving object&quot;) is a product of<br>our minds</i> and it is not really there In rigorous quantum<br>mechanical terms, the moving object—the particle with an<br>independent existence-—is an unprovable assumption<br>
According to our customarv wav of reasoning,&quot; wrote David<br>
Bohm, a professor of phvsics at Birkbeck College, University<br>
of London<br>
we could suppose that the track of grains of silver indi-<br>cates that a real electron moves continuously through<br>space in a path somewhere near these grains, and by<br>interaction caused the formation of the grams But ac-<br>cording to the usual interpretation of the quantum theory,<br>it would be incorrect to suppose that this really happened<br>All that we can say is that certain grains appeared, but<br>
we must not try to imagine that these grains were produced<br>by a real object moving through space in the way in<br>which we usuallv think of objects moving through space<br>
For although this idea of a continuously moving obiect is<br>
good enough for an approximate theory, we would discover<br>that it would break down in a very exact theory 5<br>
The natural assumption that objects, like particles, are<br>
real things that run their course in space and time according<br>to causal laws regardless of whether we are around to observe<br>them or not is repudiated bv quantum mechanics This is<br>especially significant because quantum mechanics is<i> the theory<br></i>of physics It has explained successfully everything from<br>

subatomic particles to stellar phenomena There never has<br>
been a more successful theory It has no competition<br>
Therefore, when we look at the tracks in a bubble chamber,<br>
we are left with the question, 'What made<br>
 The best<br>
answer that physicists have so far is that &quot;particles are actu-<br>ally interactions between fields A field, like a wave, is spread<br>out over a much larger area than a particle (a particle is<br>restricted to one point) A field, moreover,<br>
 fills a<br>
given space, like the gravitational field of the earth fills all of<br>the space immediately around it<br>
When two fields interact with each other they interact nei-<br>
ther gradually nor at all their areas of contact Rather, when<br>two fields interact, thev do it<i> instantaneously</i> and at one single<br>point in space ('<br>
 and locally ') These instanta-<br>
neous and local interactions make what we call particles In<br>fact, according to this theory, these instantaneous and local<br>interactions<i> are</i> &quot;particles &quot; The continual creation and anni-<br>hilation of particles at the subatomic level is the result of the<br>
continual interaction of different fields<br>
This theory is called quantum field theory Some major<br>
cornerstones of the theory were laid in 1928 by the English<br>physicist, Paul Dirac Quantum field theory has been highly<br>successful in predicting new types of particles and in explaining<br>existing particles in terms of field interactions According to<br>this theory, a separate field is associated with each tvpe of<br>particle Since only three types of particles were known in<br>
1928, only three different fields were required to explain them<br>
The problem today, however, is that there are over one<br>hundred known particles, which, according to quantum field<br>theory, require over one hundred different fields This abun-<br>dance of theoretical fields is somewhat awkward, not to mention<br>embarrassing, to physicists whose goal is to simplify nature<br>Therefore, most physicists have given up the idea of a separate<br>
field existing for each tvpe of particle<br>
Nevertheless, quantum field theory is still an important<br>
theory not only because it works, but also because it was the<br>
first theory to merge quantum mechanics and relativity, albeit<br>in a limited way All physical theories, including quantum<br>theory, must satisfy the requirement of relativity theory that<br>the laws of physics be independent of the state of motion of<br>the observer Attempts to integrate the theory of relativity<br>
with quantum theory, however, have been generally unsuc-<br>cessful Nonetheless, both relativity and quantum theory are<br>

required, and routinely used, in the understanding of particle<br>physics Their forced relationship is best described as strained<br>but necessary In this regard, one of the most successful inte-<br>grations of the two is quantum field theory, although it covers<br>only a relatively small range of phenomena *<br>
Quantum field<br>
 is an<i> ad hoc</i> theory That means that,<br>
like Bohr's famous specific-orbits-only model of the atom,<br>quantum field theory is a practical but conceptually inconsis-<br>tent scheme Some parts of it don t fit together mathematically<br>It is a working model designed around the available data to<br>give physicists a place to stand in the exploration of subatomic<br>
phenomena The reason that it has been around so long is that<br>it works so well (Some physicists think that it may work<i> too<br></i>well Thev fear that the pragmatic success of quantum field<br>theory impedes the development of a consistent theory)<br>
Even with these well-known shortcomings, the fact is that<br>
quantum field theorv is a successful phvsical theory, and it is<br>premised on the assumption that<i> physical reality is</i><br>
 According to quantum field theory, fields<br>
alone are real<i> They</i> are the substance of the universe and not<br>&quot;matter Matter (particles) is simply the momentary manifes-<br>tations of interacting fields which, intangible and insubstantial<br>as they are, are the onlv real things in the universe Their<br>interactions seem particle-like because fields interact very<br>abruptly and in very minute regions of space<br>
Quantum field theory ' is, of course, an outrageous contra-<br>
diction in terms A quantum is an indivisible whole It is a<br>small piece of something, while a field is a whole area of<br>something A quantum field is the juxtaposition of two ir-<br>reconcilable concepts In other words, it is a paradox It defies<br>our categorical imperative that something be either<i> this</i> or<br><i>that,</i> but not both<br>

It makes no sense to ask which of these is really the true<br>description Both of them are required for a complete under-<br>standing<br>
In 1922, Werner Heisenberg, as a student, asked his<br>
professor and friend-to-be, Niels Bohr, &quot;If the inner structure<br>of the atom is as closed to descriptive accounts as you say, if<br>we really lack a language for dealing with it, how can we ever<br>hope to understand atoms'*'<br>
Bohr hesitated for a moment and then said, I think we<br>
may yet be able to do so But in the process we may have to<br>learn what the word understanding<br>
 means '6<br>
In human terms it means that the same person can be<br>
good<i> and</i> evil, bold<i> and</i> timid a lion<i> and</i> a lamb<br>
All of the above notwithstanding, particle physicists of ne-<br>
cessity analyze subatomic particles as if they<i> were</i> like little<br>baseballs that fly through space and collide with each other<br>When a particle physicist studies a track on a bubble-chamber<br>photograph of a particle interaction, he assumes that it<i> was<br></i>made by a little moving object and that the other tracks on<br>the photograph likewise were made by small moving objects<br>In fact, particle interactions are analyzed in much the same<br>
terms that can be applied to the collision of billiard balls<br>Some particles collide (and are annihilated in the process) and<br>other newly created particles come flying out of the collision<br>area In short, particle interactions are analyzed essentially in<br>terms of masses velocities, and momenta These are the con-<br>
cepts of Newtonian physics and they also apply to automobiles<br>and streetcars<br>
Phvsicists do this because they have to use these concepts if<br>
they are to communicate at all What is available to them is<br>usually a black photograph with white lines on it They know<br>that, (1) according to quantum theory, subatomic particles<br>have no independent existence of their own, (2) subatomic<br>particles have wave-like characteristics as well as particle-like<br>characteristics, and (3) subatomic particles actually may be<br>manifestations of interacting fields Nonetheless, these white<br>

lines (more patterns) lend themselves to analysis in classical<br>terms, and so that is how particle physicists analyze them<br>
This dilemma, the dilemma of having to talk in classical<br>
terms about phenomena which cannot be described in classi<br>cal concepts is the basic paradox of quantum mechanics It<br>pervades every part of it It is like trying to explain an LSD<br>experience We try to use familiar concepts as points of de-<br>parture, but beyond that, the familiar concepts do not fit the<br>phenomena The alternative is to say nothing at all<br>

are also compelled to use a language taken from ordinary<br>life We act as if there really were such a thing as an<br>electric current [or a particle] because, if we forbade all<br>physicists to speak of electric current [or particles] they<br>
could no longer express their thoughts 7<br>
Therefore, physicists talk about subatomic particles as if<br>
they were real little objects that leave tracks in bubble cham-<br>bers and have an independent ( objective ) existence This<br>convention has been extremely productive Over the last forty<br>years almost one hundred particles have been discovered<br>
They constitute what Kenneth Ford calls the particle<br>

The first thing to know about the particle zoo is that every<br>
particle of the same species looks exactly alike Every electron<br>looks exactly like every other electron If you ve seen one,<br>you ve seen them all Likewise, every proton looks exactly<br>like every other proton, every neutron looks exactly like every<br>
other neutron, and so on Subatomic particles of the same<br>
type are absolutely indistinguishable<br>
Subatomic paiticles of different tvpes, however, can be<br>
recognized by their distinguishing characteristics (properties)<br>
The first distinguishing characteristic of a subatomic particle is<br>its mass A proton, for example, has about 1800 times more<br>mass than an electron (This does not necessarily mean that a<br>proton is 1800 times larger than an electron since mass and<br>size are not the same thing—a pound of lead and a pound of<br>feathers have the same mass)<br>

indicate otherwise, they are referring to the mass of the parti-<br>cle when it is at rest The mass of a particle at rest is called its<br>rest mass Any mass other than a rest mass is called a relativistic<br>mass Since the mass of a particle increases with velocity, a<br>particle can have any number of relativistic masses The size<br>of a particles relativistic mass depends upon its velocity For<br>
example, at 99 percent of the speed of light a particle s mass is<br>seven times larger than it is when the particle is at rest<br>
At velocities above 99 percent of the speed of light particle<br>
masses increase dramatically When the former electron ac-<br>celerator at Cambridge, Massachusetts, was in operation, it<br>
received electrons from a small feeder accelerator The electrons<br>from the feeder accelerator were fed into the mam accelerator<br>at 99986 the velocity of light The main accelerator then<br>increased the velocity of these electrons to 999999996 the<br>speed of light This increase in velocity may look significant,<br>but actually it is negligible The difference between the initial<br>velocity of the accelerated electrons and the final velocity of<br>the accelerated electrons is the same as the difference in velocity<br>between one automobile that can make a given trip in two<br>hours and a faster automobile that can make the same trip in<br>one hour fifty-nine minutes and fifty-nine seconds 8<br>
The<i> mass</i> of each electron, however, increased from 60<br>
times to as much as 11,800 times the electron rest mass' In<br>other words particle accelerators are misnamed They do not<br>increase the velocities of subatomic particles (the definition of<br>
'acceleration ) as much as they increase their mass Particle<br>
accelerators are<br>
 particle inlargers (massifiers?)<br>
The masses of particles, whether at rest or in motion, are<br>
measured in electron volts An electron volt has nothing to do<br>
with electrons An electron volt is a unit of<br>
 (It is the<br>
energy acquired by any particle with one unit of charge falling<br>through a potential difference of one volt) The point is that to<br>measure something in terms of electron volts is to measure its<br><i>energy,</i> yet this is<br>
 the unit of measurement that<br>
particle physicists use to measure a particle s mass For example,<br>the rest mass of an electron is 51 million electron volts (Mev)<br>and the rest mass of a proton is 938 2 million electron volts<br>The transformation of mass into energy and energv into mass<br>is such a routine phenomenon in particle physics that particle<br>physicists employ units of energy to designate a particle s<br>mass<br>

energy of being. If a particle is moving it not only has energy<br>of being (its mass) but it also has energy of motion (kinetic<br>energy). Both types of energy can be used to create new<br>particles in a particle collision.*<br>
Often it is easier to compare a particle's mass with the<br>
lightest massive particle, the electron, instead of referring to<br>the number of electron volts it contains. This arrangement<br>
makes the mass of an electron one and the mass of a proton,<br>for example, 1836.12. Using this system, the mass of any<br>
particle tells immediately how much heavier it is than an<br>electron. This is the system that is used in the table at the<br>back of the book.<br>
When physicists listed all the known particles by the order<br>
of their masses, from the lightest to the heaviest, they<br>discovered that subatomic particles fall into roughly three cat-<br>
egories: the light-weight particles, the medium-weight parti-<br>cles, and the heavy-weight particles. When it came to naming<br>these categories, however, they unaccountably lapsed into<br>
Greek again. The group of light-weight particles they called<br>
&quot;leptons,&quot; which is Greek for &quot;the light ones.&quot; The group of<br>medium-weight particles they called &quot;mesons&quot; (maze'ons),<br>which is Greek for &quot;the medium-sized ones.&quot; The group of<br>heavy-weight particles they called &quot;baryons&quot; (bary'ons), which<br>is Greek for &quot;the heavy ones.&quot; Why physicists did not call<br>these new groups &quot;light,&quot; &quot;medium,&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot; is one of<br>
the unanswerable questions of physics, t<br>
Since the electron is the lightest material particle, it is, of<br>
course, a lepton. The proton is a heavy-weight particle (a<br>baryon), although it is the lightest of the heavy-weight parti-<br>cles. Most subatomic particles are classified in this way, but<br>not all of them, which brings us to a phenomenon of particle<br>
*<br>
 formula E = me2 says that mass is energy: energy is mass. Therefore,<br>
strictly speaking, mass is not a particular form of energy.<i> Every form of<br>is mass.</i> Kinetic energy, for example, ts mass. As we speed up<i> A</i> particle, and<br>hence give it energy, AE, it<br>
 mass. Am, in exactly the amount<br>
AE = (Am)c2. Wherever energy goes, mass goes.<br>t Physicists no longer use the terms leptons, mesons and baryons to refer to<br>particle mass alone. These terms now refer to classes of particles which are<br>defined by several properties in addition to mass.. For example, the tan particle<br>(T), which was discovered by a joint team from the Stanford Linear Accelerator<br>Center (SLAC) and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) in 1975, seems to<br>be a lepton even though it has more mass than the heaviest baryon! Similarly,<br>the D particles, also discovered by a joint SLAC/LBL team fin 1976) are<br>mesons even though<i> they</i> have more mass than the tan particle.<br>

physics which, like much of quantum mechanics, escapes the<br>bounds of concept. A few particles do not fit into the lepton-<br>meson-baryon framework. Some of them are well known (like<br>the photon) and others have been theorized but not discovered<br>yet (like the graviton). All of them have in common the fact<br>that they are<i> massless particles.</i><br>
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; we exclaim. &quot;What is a massless particle?&quot;<br>&quot;A massless particle,&quot; says Jim de Wit, who has studied this<br>
phenomenon, &quot;is a particle that has zero rest mass. AH of its<br>energy is energy of motion. When a photon is created, it<br>instantly is traveling at the speed of light. It cannot be slowed<br>down (it has no mass to slow) and it cannot be speeded up<br>(nothing can travel faster than the speed of light).&quot;<br>
&quot;Massless particle&quot; is an awkward translation from mathe-<br>
matics to English. Physicists know exactly what they mean by<br>a massless particle. A &quot;massless particle&quot; is the name they<br>
give to an element in a mathematical structure. What that<br>element represents in the real world, however, is not so easy<br>to describe. In fact, it is impossible because the definition of<br>an object (like a &quot;particle&quot;) is something that has mass.<br>
Zen Buddhists have developed a technique called the<i> koan</i><br>
which, along with meditation, produces changes in our per-<br>ceptions and understanding. A<i> koan</i> is a puzzle which cannot<br>be answered in ordinary' ways because it is paradoxical. &quot;What<br>is the sound of one hand clapping?&quot; is a Zen<i> koan.</i> Zen students<br>are told to think unceasingly about a particular<i> koan</i> until<br>they know the answer. There is no single correct answer to a<br><i>koan.</i> It depends upon the psychological state of the student.<br>
Paradoxes are common in Buddhist literature. Paradoxes are<br>
the places where our rational mind bumps into its own<br>limitations. According to eastern philosophy in general, oppo-<br>sites, such as good-bad, beautiful-ugly, birth-death, and so<br>
on, are &quot;false distinctions.&quot; One cannot exist without the other.<br>
They are mental structures which we have created. These<br>
self-made and self-maintained illusions are the sole cause of<br>paradoxes. To escape the bonds of conceptual limitation is to<br>hear the sound of one hand clapping.<br>
Physics is replete with<i> koans,</i> i.e., &quot;picture a massless par-<br>
ticle.&quot; Is it a coincidence that Buddhists exploring &quot;internal&quot;<br>reality a millennium ago and physicists exploring &quot;external&quot;<br>reality a millennium later both discovered that &quot;understanding&quot;<br>involves passing the barrier of paradox?<br>

Every subatomic<br>
 has a positive, a negative, or a neu-<br>

particles with the same sign Two positively charged particles,<br>for example, find each other s<br>

 move toward one another if they are<br>
able to do so<br>

 an electron is, he also knows how it will<br>

 in question is changed so fundamentally that it no<br>
longer can be considered an electron, or a pioton, or whatever<br>it was before we altered its spin This makes us wondei whether<br>all of the different particles might be just different states of<br>motion of some underlying structure or substance This is the<br>basic question of particle physics<br>

spin Spin is<br>
 just like energy and charge It comes<br>
in chunks Like charge, all of the chunks are the same size In<br>other words, when a spinning top slows down its rotation<br>does not diminish smoothK and continuously, but in a series<br>of tmv steps These steps are so small and close together that<br>it is impossible to observe them The top appears to spin<br>
more and more slowly until it stops spinning altogether, but<br>
 the process is very jerky<br>
It is as if the top could spin, by some strange law that<br>
nobody undeistands, only at 100 revolutions per minute, 90<br>revolutions per minute, 80 revolutions per minute, and so on,<br>with absolutely no exceptions in<br>
 If our h&gt;<br>
top wants to spin slower than 100 revolutions per minute, it<br>must jump all the way down to the next slower speed of 90<br>revolutions per minute This is analogous to the<br>subatomic particles except that (1) particular types of particles<br>forevei spin at the same speed, and (2) the spin of subatomic<br>particles is calculated in terms of angular momentum<br>
Angular momentum depends upon the mass, size, and rate<br>
of rotation of a spinning object More of any one of these<br>properties increases the angular momentum of the object In<br>

general, angular momentum is the strength of the rotation or,<br>put another way, the effort required to stop the rotation The<br>more angular momentum an object has, the more effort is<br>required to stop it from spinning A spinning top does not<br>have much angular momentum, because it is small and it has<br>little mass A merry-go-round, in comparison, has an enormous<br>angular momentum, not because it rotates very fast, but be-<br>
cause it is large and it has so much mass<br>
Now that you understand spin, forget everything that you<br>
have just learned except the bottom line (angular momen-<br>tum) Every subatomic particle has a fixed, definite, and known<br>angular momentum, but<i> nothing is</i> spinning' If vou don't<br>understand, don't worry Physicists don't understand these<br>words, either They just use them (If you try to<i> understand<br></i>them, they become a<i> koan) *</i><br>

&quot;The idea of a spin without the existence of something spinning<br>

action,&quot; was the discovery that set into motion the revolution<br>of quantum mechanics Planck discovered that energy is emitted<br>and absorbed not continuously, but in small packages which<br>he called quanta Since that initial discovery Planck's con-<br>stant, which represents the quantized nature of energy emission<br>and absorption, has appeared again and again as an essential<br>element in the understanding of subatomic phenomena Five<br>years after Planck s discovery, Einstein used Planck's constant<br>to explain the photoelectric effect, and later still he used it to<br>determine the specific heat of solids, an area far removed<br>from Planck's original study of black-body radiation Bohr<br>discovered that the angular momentum of electrons as they<br>
orbit atomic nuclei is a function of Planck s constant, de Broglie<br>
used Planck s constant to calculate the wavelength of matter<br>waves, and it is a central element in Heisenberg s uncertainty<br>principle<br>
As important as Planck s constant is in the realm of subatomic<br>
particles, however, it is entirely unobservable in the world at<br>large This is because the si/e of the packages by which energy<br>is emitted and absorbed is so small that energy at our gross<br>level appears to be one continuous flow SimilarK, because<br>the indivisible unit of angular momentum is so small, it, too,<br>
cannot be observed in the macroscopic world A spectator<br>
swivelmg in his chair at a tennis match has 100000000000000-<br>0000000000000000000 (1033) times more angular momentum<br>than an electron Put another way, a change of one penny in<br>the gross national product of the United States is a disturbance<br>more than a<i> billion billion</i> times greater than a change by one<br>unit of the spectator's angular momentum 12<br>
Instead of writing out the actual angular momentum of a<br>
subatomic particle, physicists usually indicate the spin of a<br>subatomic particle bv comparing it to the spin of a photon,<br>whose spin they call one This system has revealed yet an-<br>other unexplamable pattern of subatomic phenomena Entire<br>familes of particles have similar spin characteristics The entire<br>
family of leptons, the light-weight particles, for example, has<br>a spin of<br>
 which means that thev<i> all</i> have an angular mo-<br>

 of a photon's angular momentum The<br>
same is true for the entire family of baryons, the heavy-weight<br>
particles The mesons also, have peculiar spin characteristics<br>They spin in such a way that their angular momenta is always<br>either 0, 1, 2, 3, etc in relation to the angular momentum of<br>a photon, but nothing in between (0 = no spin, 1 = the same<br>

angular momentum as a photon, 2 = twice the angular momen-<br>tum of a photon, etc.). The spin characteristics of all of the<br>families and all of the particles are in the table at the back of<br>the book.<br>
The values of a particle's charge, spin and other major char-<br>
acteristics are represented by specific numbers. These num-<br>bers are called quantum numbers. Every particle has a set of<br>quantum numbers which identify it as a particular type of<br>particle. * Every particle of a particular type has the same set<br>of quantum numbers as every other particle of the same type.<br>Every electron, for example, has the same quantum numbers<br>as every other electron. An electron's quantum numbers, how-<br>ever, distinguish it from protons, all of which also have the<br>same quantum numbers. Individual particles don't have much<br>
personality, In fact, they don't have any personality at all.<br>
When Dirac imposed the requirements of relativity on<br>
quantum theory, his formalism indicated the existence of a<br>particular positively charged particle. Since the only positively<br>charged particle known in those days (1928) was the proton,<br>Dirac, and most other physicists, assumed that his theory<br>
had accounted (mathematically) for the proton. (His theory<br>even was criticized for yielding the &quot;wrong&quot; proton mass.)<br>
Upon closer examination, however, it became evident that<br>
Dirac's theory described not the proton, but an entirely dif-<br>
ferent particle. Dirac's new particle was like an electron except<br>that its charge and some of its other major properties were<br>exactly opposite to those of an electron.<br>
In 1932, Carl Anderson, at Cal Tech (who hadn't heard of<br>
Dirac's theory) actually discovered this new particle and called<br>
it a positron. Physicists later discovered that every particle<br>
has a counterpart which is exactly like it but opposite in<br>
several major respects. This new class of particles was called<br>anti-particles. An anti-particle, despite its name, is a particle.<br>(The anti-particle of an anti-particle is another particle).<br>
Some particles have other particles as anti-particles (for<br>
example, a positive pi meson is the anti-particle of a negative<br>pi meson, and the other way round). A few particles are their<br>own anti-particles (like the photon). All of the particles and<br>their anti-particles are in the table at the back of the book.<br>
* The basic quantum numbers are spin, isotopic spin, charge, strangeness,<br>
charm, baryon number and lepton number.<br>

The meeting of a particle and its anti-particle is always<br>
spectacular. Whenever a particle and its anti-particle meet,<br>
they annihilate each other! When an electron meets a positron,<br>for example, both of them disappear and in their place are two<br>photons which instantly depart the scene at the speed of light.<br>The particle and the anti-particle literally disappear in a puff<br>of light. Conversely, particles and anti-particles can be cre-<br>ated out of energy and always in pairs.<br>
The universe is made of both particles and anti-particles.<br>
Our part of it, however, is made almost entirely of regular<br>particles which combine into regular atoms to make regular<br>molecules which make regular matter which is what we are<br>made of. Physicists speculate that in other parts of the universe<br>
anti-particles combine into anti-atoms to make anti-molecules<br>which make anti-matter which is what anti-people would be<br>made of. There are no anti-people in our part of the universe<br>because, if there were, they all long since have disappeared in<br>a flash of light.<br>
Leptons, mesons, baryons, mass, charge, spin, and anti-<br>
particles are some of the concepts that physicists use to catego-<br>rize subatomic phenomena when they momentarily assume<br>that subatomic particles are real objects that move through<br>space and time. These concepts are useful, but only in a<br>limited context. That context is when physicists, for conven-<br>ience, pretend, as we all do, that dancers can exist apart from<br>a dance.<br>

<b>CHAPTER</b><br>
1<br>
The Dance<br>
The dance of subatomic particles never ends and it is never<br>the same. However, physicists have found a way to diagram<br>the parts of it that interest them.<br>
The simplest drawing of any type of movement is a space<br>
map. A space map shows the location of things in space. The<br>map, for example (first drawing, next page), shows the positions<br>
of San Francisco, California and Berkeley, California. The<br>vertical axis is the north-south axis, as on any map, and the<br>horizontal axis is the east-west line. The map also shows the<br>path of a helicopter flying between San Francisco and Berke-<br>ley and, on a greatly enlarged basis, it shows the path of a<br>proton traveling around the cyclotron at the Lawrence Berke-<br>ley Laboratory.<br>
Like all road maps, this space map is two dimensional. It<br>
shows how far north (the first dimension) and how far east (the<br>second dimension) Berkeley is of San Francisco. It does not<br>show the altitude of the helicopter (the third dimension) and<br>
it does not indicate how much time (the fourth dimension) the<br>flight from San Francisco to Berkeley required. If we want to<br>show the time involved in the San Francisco-Berkeley flight<br>we must draw a space-time map.<br>
A space-time map (second drawing, next page) shows the<br>
positions of things in space and it also shows their positions' in<br>time. The vertical axis on a space-time map is the time axis.<br>Space-time maps are read from the bottom up because the<br>passage of time is represented by movement up the time axis.<br>The horizontal axis of a space-time map is the space axis which<br>

shows the movement of objects in space. The path traced by<br>an object on a space-time map is called its &quot;world line.&quot; For<br>example, the space-time map below shows the same flight<br>
from San Francisco to Berkeley.<br>

<b>SPACE</b><br>
Initially the helicopter is sitting on the ground in San<br>
Francisco. Its world line is vertical, because, although it is not<br>moving in space, it is moving in time. A to B is the world line<br>
of the helicopter while it sits on its pad in San Francisco.<br>When the helicopter takes off for Berkeley it moves forward<br>both in time and space, and its world line traces the path on<br>the space-time map between B and C. When it lands in Berke-<br>ley its world line is vertical once again because it no longer<br>moves in space, but, like all things, it continues to move in<br>time (C to D). The arrowheads show which direction the<br>
helicopter is moving. It can move backward and forward in<br>space but, of course, it only can move forward in time. The<br>dashed lines show the world lines of San Francisco and Berke-<br>

Physicists use similar space-time maps to diagram particle<br>
interactions. Below is a space-time diagram of an electron<br>emitting a photon.<br>
<b>TIME</b><br>
<b>SPACE</b><br>
Starting at the bottom, an electron moves through space<br>
with a certain velocity. At the point in space and time indi-<br>cated by the dot, it emits a photon. The photon flys off at the<br>speed of light to the right and the electron, its momentum<br>
 by the emission of the photon, alters course and moves<br>
off more slowly to the left.<br>
In 1949, Richard Feynman discovered that space-time maps<br>
like these have an exact correspondence with mathematical<br>expressions which give the probabilities of the interactions<br>that they depict. Feynman's discovery was an extension of<br>
Dirac's 1928 theory and it helped to evolve that theory into<br>
the quantum field theory that we know today. Therefore, this<br>type of diagram is sometimes called a Feynman diagram.*<br>

A happening in the subatomic world is called an &quot;event.&quot;<br>
Events are indicated in Feynman diagrams by dots.<i> Every</i><br>
<i>subatomic event is marked by the annihilation of the initial<br>particles and the creation of new ones.</i> This is true for every<br>event and not only those involving particles and anti-particles.<br>
With this in mind, we now can look at the particle diagram<br>
on page 214 again, and see it in a different light. Instead of<br>saying that an electron moving through space emitted a photon<br>
which changed its (the electron's) momentum, we can say as<br>well that an electron moving through space emitted a photon<br>and went out of existence at that point! A new electron was<br>created in this process and<i> it</i> departed the scene with a new<br>momentum. There is no way of knowing if this interpretation<br>is correct or not because all electrons are identical. However,<br>it is simpler and more consistent to assume that the original<br>particle was annihilated and a new particle was created. The<br>indistinguishability of subatomic particles makes this possible.<br>

Let us look again at the Feynman diagram of an electron-<br>
positron annihilation Suppose that we use the arrowhead to<br>indicate which is the particle (the electron) and which is the<br>anti-particle (the positron) by making the arrowheads that point<br>up indicate the particles and the arrowheads that point down<br>indicate the anti-particles That would make the diagram on<br>page 215 look like the drawing on page 218<br>
Naturally, time, as we experience it, only travels in one<br>
direction, forward, and that is up on a space-time diagram<br>
Nonetheless, this simple convention would give us an easy<br>
way of telling particles from anti-particles World lines that<br>appear to move forward in time would belong to particles and<br>world lines that appear to move backward in time would be-<br>long to anti-particles (Photons would not have arrowheads<br>because they are their own anti-particles)<br>

Feynman demonstrated in 1949 that this convention is more<br>
than an artistic device. He discovered that a positron field<br>propagating forward in time is mathematically the same as an<br>electron field propagating backward in time! In other words,<br>according to quantum field theory,<i> an anti-particle is a parti-<br>cle moving backward in time.</i> An anti-particle does not<i> have<br></i>to be considered as a particle moving backward in time, but<br>that is the simplest and most symmetric way of viewing anti-<br>
particles.<br>
For example, because the arrowheads distinguish the parti-<br>
cles from the anti-particles, we can twist the original Feynman<br>diagram around into any position that we choose and still be<br>able to distinguish the one from the other. Here are some<br>different ways that we can twist the original Feynman diagram.<br>
Each of these variations is a separate diagram and repre-<br>
sents a particle/anti-particle interaction.* By twisting the<br>
original diagram completely around we can represent every<br>
* These three interactions are:<br>
 a photon and an electron annihilate and<br>
create a photon and an electron (electron-photon scattering),<i> middle,</i> two photons<br>annihilate to create a positron and an electron (positron-electron pair creation),<br>and,<br>
 a positron and a photon annihilate to create a positron anJ a photon<br>
(positron-photon scattering).<br>

possible interaction between an electron, a positron, and two<br>photons. The precision, simplicity, and symmetry of Feynman<br>diagrams make them a special type of poetry.<br>
Below is a space-time diagram of<i> two events.</i> A collision<br>
between two photons (at B) creates an electron-positron pair<br>and, subsequently, an electron and a positron annihilate each<br>other and create two photons (at A). (The left half of this<br>diagram, the interaction at A, is the same as the electron-<br>positron annihilation on page 218).<br>
Ordinarily we would interpret these events as follows: Two<br>
photons collide in the lower right of the diagram producing an<br>electron-positron pair. The electron flies off to the right while<br>the positron flies off to the left where it meets another electron<br>which has entered the diagram from the lower left. There<br>they mutually annihilate and create two photons which depart<br>in opposite directions.<br>
The preferred interpretation of quantum field theory, how-<br>
ever, is much simpler. In it there is only<i> one</i> particle. That<br>particle, an electron, enters the diagram from the lower left<br>
and travels forward in time and space until it emits two photons<br>at A. This causes it to reverse its direction in time. Traveling<br>

backward in time as a positron it absorbs two photons at B,<br>reverses its direction in time again, and agdin becomes an<br>electron Instead of three particles there is only one particle<br>which, moving from left to right, travels first forward in time,<br>then backward in time, and then forward in time again<br>
This is the static type of space-time picture described in<br>
Einstein's theory of relativity (page 150) If we could survey<br>
an entire span of time as we can survey an entire region of<br>space, we would see that events do not unfold with the flow of<br>time but present themselves complete, like a finished painting<br>on the fabric of space-time In such a picture movements<br>backward and forward in time are no more significant than<br>movements backward and forward in space<br>
The illusion of events 'developing' in time is due to our<br>
particular type of awareness which allows us to see only nar-<br>row strips of the total space-time picture one at a time For<br>example, suppose that we place a piece of cardboard with d<br>narrow strip cut out of it over the diagram on page 219 so that<br>all that we can see of the interaction is what is visible through<br>the cut-out If we move the cardboard slowly upward, starting<br>
at the bottom, our restricted view discovers a series of events,<br>each one happening dfter the other<br>
First, we see three particles two photons entering our view<br>
from the right and an electron entering from the left (1)<br>
Next, we see the photons collide to produce an electron-<br>
positron pair, the electron fly ing off to the right and the positron<br>flying off to the left (2) Finallv, we see the newlv created<br>positron meet the original electron to create two new photons<br>(3; Only when we remove the entire cardboard (which was an<br>artificial construction anyway) can we see the complete pic-<br>ture<br>

fact ) They are virtually photons The only thing that keeps<br>them from being full-fledged photons is<br>
 abrupt re-<br>
absorption by the electron that emits them *<br>
In other words first then is an electron, then there is an<br>
eltctron and a photon and then thcie is an electron again<br>This situation is of course a violation of the conservation law<br>of mass-energ\ The conservation law of<br>
 says, in<br>
effect that we cannot get soim thing for nothing According to<br>
quantum field theory<br>
 we do get something for<br>
nothing, but only for about one thousand tnlhonth (10~15) of a<br>second<br>
 The reason that this can happen according to the<br>
theory is the famous Heisenberg unceitainty principle<br>
Tht Heisenberg uncertamtv principle, as it originally was<br>
formulated savs that the more certain we are of the position<br>of a particle, the less certain<br>
 can be about its momentum,<br>
and the other<br>
 round We can determine its position<br>
preciseK but in that east we cannot determine its momen-<br>tum at all If we choose to measure its momentum precisely,<br>then we will not be able to know where it is located (page<br>
111)<br>
In addition to the reciprocal uncertainty of position and<br>
momentum there also is a<br>
 uncertainty of time and<br>
energy<br>
 less uncertamtv there is about the time involved<br>
in a subatomic event the more unr<br>
 there is about the<br>
energy involved in the event (and tht other way round) A<br>measurement as accurate as one thousand tnlhonth of a second<br>leaves very little uncertamU about the time<br>
 in the<br>
emission and absorption of a virtual photon It does, however,<br>cause a specific<br>
 about how much energ\ was in-<br>

another way, the event happens and is over with so quickly<br>
that the electron can get away with it<br>
It is as if the policeman who enforces the conservation law<br>
of mass-energy turns his hack on violations if they happen<br>quickly enough However, the more flagrant the violation,<br>the more quickly it must happen<br>
If we provide the necessary energy for a virtual photon to<br>
become a real photon without violating the conservation law<br>of mass-energy, it does just that That is why an excited electron<br>emits a real photon An excited electron is an electron that is<br>
in an energy level higher than its ground state An electron's<br>ground state is its lowest energy level wheie it is as close to<br>the nucleus of an atom as it can get The only photons that<br>electrons emit when they are in their ground state are virtual<br>photons which they immediately re-absorb so as not to violate<br>
the conservation law of mass-energy<br>
An electron considers the ground state to be its home It<br>
doesn't like to leave home In fact, the onlv time it leaves its<br>ground state is when it literally is pushed out of it with extra<br>energy In that case, the electron s first concern is to get back<br>to its ground state (provided that it hasn't been pushed so far<br>
from the nucleus that, in effect, it becomes a free electron)<br>
Since the ground state is a low-energv state, the electron<br>must lose its excess energy before it can return to it Therefore,<br>when an electron is at an energy level higher than its ground<br>
state, it jettisons its excess energv in the form of a photon<br>The jettisoned photon is one of the electron's virtual photons<br>that suddenly finds itself with enough energy to keep going<br>without violating the conservation<br>
 of mass-energv, and it<br>
does In other words, one of the electron's virtual photons<br>suddenly is 'promoted&quot; to a real photon The amount of energy<br>(the frequency) of the promoted photon depends upon how<br>much excess energy the electron had to jettison (The discovery<br>that electrons emit only photons of certain energies and no<br>
others is what made the quantum theorv a<i> quantum</i> theory)<br>
Electrons are always surrounded bv a swarm of virtual photons *<br>
If two electrons come close enough to each other, close<br>
enough so that their virtual-photon clouds overlap, it is possible<br>that a virtual photon that is emitted from one electron will be<br>absorbed by the other electron Below is a Feynman diagram<br>

of a virtual photon being emitted by one electron and ab-<br>sorbed by another electron<br>
The closer the electrons come to each other, the more this<br>
phenomenon occurs Of course, the process is two-way with<br>both electrons absorbing virtual photons that were emitted by<br>the other<br>
This is how electrons repel each other The closer two<br>
electrons come, the more virtual photons they exchange The<br>more virtual photons they exchange, the more sharply their<br>paths are deflected The &quot;repulsive force' between them is<br>simply the cumulative effect of these exchanges of virtual<br>photons, the number of which increases at close range and<br>
decreases at a distance According to this theory, there is no<br>such thing as action-at-a-distance—only more and fewer<br>exchanges of virtual photons These interactions (absorptions<br>and emissions) happen on location, so to speak, right there<br>
where the particles involved are located *<br>
The mutual repulsion of two particles of the same charge,<br>
like two electrons, is an example of an electromagnetic force<br>In fact, according to quantum field theory, an electromagnetic<br>
force ts the mutual exchange of virtual photons (Physicists<br>like to say that the electromagnetic force is mediated&quot; by<br>photons) Every electrically charged particle continually emits<br>

and re absorbs virtual photons and/or exchanges them with<br>other charged particles When two electrons (two negative<br>charges) exchange virtual photons they repulse each other<br>
The same thing happens when two protons (two positive<br>charges) exchange virtual photons When a proton and an<br>electron (a positive charge and a negative charge) exchange<br>virtual photons they attract each other<br>
Therefore since the development of quantum field theory,<br>
physicists generally have substituted the word interaction<br>for the word force (An interaction is when anything influ-<br>ences anything else) In this context—a mutual exchange of<br>virtual photons—it is a more precise term than force which<br>labels that which happens between electrons but does not say<br>anything about it That part of quantum field theory (Dirac s<br>original part) which deals with electrons, photons, and positrons<br>is called quantum electrodynamics<br>
Virtual photons even if they were charged particles would<br>
not be visible in a bubble chamber because of their extremely<br>short lives Their existence is inferred mathematicallv There-<br>
fore, this extraordinary theory that particles exert a force on<br>each other by exchanging other particles clearly is a free<br>creation of the human mind (page 8) It is not necessarily<br>how nature really is it is only a mental construction which<br>correctlv predicts what nature probably is going to do next<br>There might be and probably are other mental constructs<br>that can do as good a job as this one or better (although<br>phvsicists have not been able to think of them) The most that<br>we can say about this or any other theory is not whether it is<br>
true or not but only whether it works or not that is whether<br>
it does what it is supposed to do<br>
Quantum theory is supposed to predict the probabilities of<br>
given subatomic phenomena to occur under certain circum-<br>stances Even though quantum field theory as a whole is not<br>totally consistent the pragmatic reality is that it<i> works</i> There<br>
is a Fevnman diagram for<br>
 interaction and every Feynman<br>
diagram corresponds to a mathematical formula which precisely<br>predicts the probability of the diagramed interaction to<br>happen *<br>

decided to apply the new virtual particle theory to the strong<br>force<br>
The strong force is the force that keeps atomic nuclei to-<br>
gether It has to be strong because the protons which along<br>
with the neutrons make up the nucleus of an atom naturally<br>repel each other Being particles of like sign (positive) protons<br>want to be as far away from each other as they can get This is<br>because of the electromagnetic force between them Howev<br>er within the nucleus of an atom these mutually repulsive<br>protons not only are kept in close proximity, but they also are<br>bound together very tightly Whatever is binding these protons<br>together into a nucleus physicists reasoned must be a very<br>strong force compared to the electromagnetic force, which<br>
works against it Therefore they decided to call the strong<br>force, naturally, the strong force<br>
The strong force is well named because it is one hundred<br>
times stronger than the electromagnetic force It is the strongest<br>force known in nature Like the electromagnetic force it is a<br>fundamental glue Ihe electromagnetic force holds atoms to<br>gether externally (with each other to form molecules) and<br>internally (it binds electrons to their orbits around atomic<br>nuclei) The strong force holds the nucleus itself together<br>
The strong force is somewhat musclebound so to speak<br>
Although it is the strongest force known in nature it also has<br>the shortest range of all the forces known in nature For<br>example, as a proton approaches the nucleus of an atom it<br>begins to experience the repulsive electromagnetic force be-<br>tween itself and the protons within the nucleus The closer<br>the free proton gets to the protons in the nucleus the stronger<br>the repulsive electromagnetic force between them becomes<br>(At one third the original distance, for example, the force is<br>nine times as strong) This force causes a deflection in the<br>
path of the free proton The deflection is a gentle one if the<br>proton is distant from the nucleus and very pronounced if the<br>proton should come close to the nucleus<br>
However, if we push the free proton to within about one<br>
ten-tnlhonth (10 n) of a centimeter of the nucleus it<br>is sucked<i> into</i> the nucleus with a force one hundred times<br>more powerful than the repulsive electromagnetic force One<br>ten-tnlhonth of a centimeter is about the si/e of the proton<br>itself In other words, the proton is relatively unaffected by<br>the strong force, even at a distance only slightly greater than<br>

its own magnitude Closer than that, however, and it is com-<br>pletely overpowered by the strong force<br>
Yukawa decided to explain this powerful but very short-<br>
range strong force in terms of virtual particles<br>
The strong force<br>
 Yukawa, is mediated by virtual<br>
particles like the electromagnetic force is mediated ' by virtual<br>photons According to Yukawa s theory, just as the electro-<br>magnetic force is the exchange of virtual photons, the strong<br>force is the exchange of another type of virtual particle J ist<br>as electrons never sit idle, but constantly emit and re-absorb<br>virtual photons, so nucleons are not inert, but constantly emit<br>and re-absorb their own type of virtual particles<br>
A nucleon is a proton or a neutron Both of these particles<br>
are called nucleons since both of them are found in the nuclei<br>of atoms They are so similar to each other that a proton,<br>roughly speaking can be considered as a neutron with a positive<br>charge<br>
Yukawa knew the range of the strong force from the results<br>
of published experiments Assuming that the limited range of<br>the strong force was identical to the limited range of a virtual<br>particle emitted from a nucleon in the nucleus, he calculated<br>how much time such a virtual particle would require at close<br>to the speed of light to go that distance and return to the<br>
nucleon This time calculation allowed him to use the un-<br>certainty relation between time and energy to calculate the<br>energy (mass) of his hypothetical particle<br>
Twelve years and one case of mistaken identity later, physi-<br>
cists discovered Yukawa s hypothetical particle * They called<br>
it a meson An<i> entire family of mesons</i> it later was discovered,<br>are the particles which nucleons exchange to constitute the<br>strong force The particular meson which physicists discovered<br>
first, they called a pion Pion is short for pi (pronounced<br>
&quot;pie ) meson Pions come in three varieties positive, nega-<br>tive, and neutral<br>
In other words, a proton, like an electron, is a beehive of<br>
activity Not only does it continually emit and re-absorb virtual<br>photons, which makes it susceptible to the electromagnetic<br>force, it also emits and re-absorbs virtual pions, which makes<br>it susceptible to the strong force as well (Particles which do<br>

When an electron emits a virtual photon which is absorbed<br>
by another particle, the electron is said to be interacting<br>with the other particle However, when an electron emits a<br>virtual photon and then re-absorbs it, the electron is said to<br>
be interacting with itself Self-interaction makes the world of<br>subatomic particles a kaleidoscopic reality whose very constit-<br>uents are themselves unceasing processes of transformation<br>
Protons, like electrons, can interact with themselves in more<br>
ways than one The simplest proton self-interaction is the<br>emission and re-absorption, within the time permitted by the<br>uncertainty principle, of a virtual pion This interaction is<br>
analogous to an electron emitting and re-absorbing a virtual<br>photon First there is a proton, then there is a proton and a<br>neutral pion, then there is a proton again Below is a Fevnman<br>diagram of a proton emitting and re-absorbing a virtual netural<br>pion<br>

neutral pion constitute a violation of the conservation law of<br>
mass-energy since their mass together is greater than the mass<br>
of the original proton Something (the neutral pion) literally<br>has been created out of nothing and quickly disappears again<br>(making this a virtual process) The life-span of the new parti-<br>cles is limited to the time calculated via the Heisenberg<br>uncertamtv principle They quickly merge, annihilating each<br>
other, and create another proton One blink of an eye,<br>figuratively speaking, and the whole thing is over<br>
There is another way in which a proton can interact with<br>
itself In addition to  mitting and re-absorbing a neutral pion,<br>a proton can emit a positive pion However, bv emitting a<br>positive pion, the proton<br>
 tansforms itself into a<br>
neutron' First there is a proton, then there is a<i> neutron</i> (which<br>by itself has more mass than the original proton) plus a positive<br>pion, then there is a proton again In other words, one of the<br>dances that a proton does continually changes it into a neutron<br>and back into a proton again Below is a Feynman diagram of<br>this dance<br>
Every nucleon is surrounded by a cloud of virtual pions,<br>
which it constantly emits and re-absorbs If a proton comes<br>close enough to a neutron so that their virtual-pion clouds<br>overlap, some of the virtual pions emitted by the proton are ab-<br>sorbed by the neutron On the next page is a Feynman diagram<br>of a virtual-pion exchange between a proton and a neutron<br>

In the left half of the diagram, a proton emits a positively<br>
charged pion, momentarily transforming itself into a neutron<br>
Before the pion can be re-absorbed,<br>
 it is captured<br>
by a nearby neutron This pion capture causes the neutron to<br>transform itself into a proton The exchange of the positive<br>pion causes the proton to become a neutron and the neutron<br>to become a proton The two original nucleons, now bound<br>together by this exchange, have changed roles<br>
This is the basic Yukawa interaction The strong force, as<br>
Yukawa theorized in 1935, is the multiple exchange of virtual<br>pions between nucleons The number of the exchanges (the<br>strength of the force) increases at close range and decreases at<br>a distance<br>
In a similar manner, neutrons never sit still and just be<br>
neutrons Like protons and electrons thev also constantly in-<br>teract with themselves by emitting and re-absorbing virtual<br>particles Like protons, neutrons emit and re-absorb neutral<br>pions On the top of the next page is a Fevnman diagram of a<br>neutron emitting and re-absorbing a neutral pion<br>

four fundamental types of glue In addition to the strong force<br>and the electromagnetic force, there is the &quot;weak force and<br>the gravitational force *<br>

Gravity is the long-range force which holds together solar<br>
systems, galaxies, and universes However, on the subatomic<br>level its effect is so negligible that it is ignored altogether<br>Future theories, hopefully, will be able to take it into ac-<br>count t<br>
The weak force is the least known of the four forces Its<br>
existence was inferred from the times required by certain<br>subatomic interactions The strong force is so short-range and<br>powerful that strong-force interactions happen very, verv fast,<br>in about 00000000000000000000001<br>
 seconds Howev-<br>
er, physicists discovered that a certain other t&gt;pe of particle<br>interaction which they knew involved neither the electro-<br>magnetic nor the gravitational forces, required a much longer<br>time, about 0000000001 (10 &quot;') seconds Thev therefore de-<br>duced from this strange phenomenon that there must exist a<br>
fourth type of force Since this new fourth force was known to<br>be weaker than the electromagnetic force, it was called the<br>weak force<br>
In the order of their strength, the four forces are<br>
Strong (nuclear) forte<br>
Electromagnetic force<br>Weak force<br>Gravity<br>
Since the strong force and the electromagnetic force can be<br>
explained in terms of virtual particles, physicists assume that<br>the same is true of the weak force and gravitv The particle<br>associated with gravity is the graviton, whose properties have<br>
bet n theon/ed, but whose existence never has been confirmed<br>The particle associated with the weak force is the &quot;W&quot; parti-<br>cle, about which much has been theon/ed, but not much has<br>been discovered<br>
The range of the strong force, relative to the electromagnetic<br>
force, is limited because mesons, relative to photons, have so<br>much mass Remember that the policeman who enforces the<br>conservation law of mass-energy is willing to turn his back if<br>the violation is quick enough, but the more flagrant the<br>violation, the more quickly it must happen The momentary<br>creation of a meson out of nothing is a much more flagrant<br>

violation of the conservation law of mass-energy than the mo-<br>mentary creation of a photon out of nothing Therefore, the<br>creation and re-absorption of a meson must happen more<br>quickly to stay within the protection, so to speak, of the<br>uncertainty relation between time and energy Because the<br>life-span of a virtual meson is limited, its range also is limited<br>
The rule of thumb governing this phenomenon is this The<br>
stronger the force, the more massive is the mediating parti-<br>cle, and the shorter is its range The range of the strong force<br>is only about one ten-tnlhonth (10&quot;n) of a centimeter Accord-<br>ingly, the range of the electromagnetic force is much greater<br>than the range of the strong force In fact, the range of the<br>
electromagnetic force is<i> infinite</i> This is because photons<i> don't<br>have any rest</i><br>
'Wait a minute,' says Jim de Wit, agreeing with us for a<br>
change This doesn t make sense A virtual photon is a photon<br>which is emitted and re-absorbed quicklv enough to avoid<br>violating the conservation law of mass-energv<br>
&quot;Right,&quot; says a particle physicist on his way to the cyclo-<br>
tron<br>
' Then how can a particle, or anything else, be emitted and<br>
re-absorbed within certain time limits, like the time limits<br>imposed by the uncertainty principle, and still have an<i> infi-<br>nite</i><br>
 It doesn t make sense &quot;<br>
De Wit has a point At first glance it appears that he is<br>
correct On closer examination, however, there<i> v&gt;</i> a subtle<br>logic involved which<br>
 make sense If the limitations of the<br>
conservation law of mass-energy are avoided by a balance of<br>time and energy (mass) permitted by the uncertainty principle,<br>and a<i> \</i> irtual photon has<i> no</i> (rest) mass, then it has all the time<br>in the world, literally to go where it pleases In other words,<br>there is no practical difference between a 'real' photon and a<br>
'virtual&quot; photon The only difference between them is that<br>
the creation of a ' real&quot; photon does not violate the conserva-<br>tion law of mass-energy and the creation of a &quot;virtual&quot; photon<br>avoids this law momentarily via the Heisenberg uncertainty<br>
principle<br>
This is a good example of how unreal&quot; and &quot;ivory-tower-<br>
like&quot; the non-mathematical explanation of a successful physical<br>theory can sound The reason for this is that physical theories,<br>in order to describe more accurately the phenomena under<br>consideration, have become more and more divorced from<br>everyday experience (i e more abstract) Although these highly<br>

<A name=252></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-252_1.png"><br>
236 / I CLUTCH MY IDEAS<br>
abstract theories, such as quantum theory and relativity, are<br>unaccountably accurate to an awesome degree, they truly are<br>' free creations&quot; of the human mind Their primary link with<br>ordinary experience is not the abstract content of their<br>formalisms, but the fact that, somehow, they work *<br>
The distinction between a transient, virtual (nothmg-some-<br>
thmg-nothing) state and a 'real&quot; one (something-something-<br>
somethmg) is similar to the Buddhist distinction between reality<br>as it actually is and the way that we usually see it For example,<br>Feynman himself described the difference between a virtual<br>state and a real state (of a photon) as a matter of perspective<br>
what looks like a real process from one point of view<br>
may appear as a virtual process occurring over a more<br>extended time<br>
For example, if we wish to study a given real process,<br>
such as the scattering of light, we can, if we wish, include<br>in principle the source, scatterer, and eventual absorber<br>of the scattered light in our analysis We may imagine<br>that no photon is present initially, and that the source<br>then emits light The light is then scattered and<br>eventually absorbed From this point of view the proc-<br>ess is virtual, that is, we start with no photons and end<br>
with none Thus we can analyze the process by means of<br>our formulas for real processes by attempting to break<br>the analysis into parts corresponding to emission, scatter-<br>ing, and absorption 2<br>
According to Buddhist theory, reality is &quot;virtual&quot; in nature<br>
What appear to be real&quot; objects in it, like trees and people,<br>actually are transient illusions which result from a limited<br>mode of awareness The illusion is that parts of an overall<br>virtual process are &quot;real&quot; (permanent) 'things ' &quot;Enlightenment&quot;<br>is the experience that 'things,&quot; including I,' are transient,<br>virtual states devoid of separate existences, momentary links<br>
between illusions of the past and illusions of the future unfolding<br>in the illusion of time<br>

particles emit virtual particles which emit virtual particles in a<br>

THE DANCE / 239<br>
In the words of an English interpreter<br>
In the heaven of Indra, there is said to be a network of<br>pearls, so arranged that if you look at one you see all the<br>others reflected in it In the same way each object in the<br>
world is not merely itself but involves every other object<br>and in fact is everything else 4<br>
The appearance of physical reality according to Mahayana<br>
Buddhism, is based upon Jue interdependence of all things *,t<br>
Although this booK is not about physics and Buddhism<br>
specifically, the similarities between the two<br>
 in the<br>
field of particle physics, are so striking and plentiful that a<br>
student of one necessarily must find value in the other<br>
Now we come to the most psychedelic aspect of particle phys-<br>
ics Below is a Feynman diagram of a three-particle interaction<br>
In this diagram no world line leads up to the interaction<br>
and no world line leads away from it It just happens It<br>happens literally out of nowhere for no apparent reason, and<br>without any apparent cause Where there was<i> no-thing,<br></i>suddenly in a flash of spontaneous existence, there are three<br>particles which vanish without a trace<br>

This type of Feynman diagram is called a &quot;vacuum diagram &quot;*<br>
That is because the interactions happen in a vacuum A<br>&quot;vacuum,&quot; as we normally construe it, is a space that is entirely<br>empty Vacuum diagrams, however, graphically demonstrate<br>
that there is no such thing From &quot;empty space&quot; comes<br>
something, and then that something disappears again into<br>&quot;empty space &quot;<br>
In the subatomic realm, a vacuum obviously is<i> not</i> empty<br>
So where did the notion of a completely empty, barren, and<br>sterile &quot;space&quot; come<br>
 We made it up' There is no such<br>
thing in the real world as empt&gt; space &quot; It is a mental con-<br>struction, an idealization, which we have taken to be true<br>
&quot;Empty&quot; and 'full&quot; are ' false distinctions' that<i> we have</i><br>
<i>created,</i> like the distinction between &quot;something' and 'noth-<br>ing &quot; Thev are abstractions from experience which we have<br>mistaken for experience Perhaps we have lived so long in our<br>abstractions that instead of realizing that they are drawn from<br>the real world we believe that they<i> are</i> the real world<br>
Vacuum diagrams are the serious product of a well-inten-<br>
tioned physical science However, thev also are wonderful<br>reminders that we can intellectually create our 'reality &quot; It is<br>not possible, according to our usual conceptions, for &quot;something&quot;<br>to come out of empty space ' but, at the subatomic level,<i> it</i><br>
<i>does,</i> which is what vacuum diagrams illustrate In other words,<br>there is no such thing as &quot;emptv space&quot; (or 'nothing&quot;) except<br>as a concept m our categorizing minds<br>

In any case, vacuum diagrams are representations of re-<br>
markable transformations of &quot;something&quot; into &quot;nothing&quot; and<br>&quot;nothing&quot; into &quot;something ' These transformations occur<br>
continuously in the subatomic realm and are limited onlv by<br>the uncertainty principle, the conservation laws, and proba-<br>bility *<br>
There are roughly twelve conservation laws Some of them<br>
affect every type of subatomic interaction Some of them af-<br>fect only some types of subatomic interaction There is a simple<br>rule of thumb to remember The stronger the force, the more<br>its interactions are restrained by conservation laws For<br>example, strong interactions are restrained by all twelve con-<br>servation laws, electromagnetic interactions are restrained by<br>eleven of the conservation laws, and weak interactions are<br>

restrained by only eight of the conservation laws t Gravitational<br>interactions, those involving the most feeble force in the<br>subatomic world, have not been studied yet (no one has found<br>a graviton), but they may violate even more conservation laws<br>
Nonetheless, where the conservation laws have jurisdiction,<br>
they are inviolable rules which shape the form of all particle<br>interactions For example, the conservation law of mass-energy<br>dictates that all spontaneous particle decays be ' downhill &quot;<br>When a single particle<br>
 decays, it always decays<br>
into lighter particles The total mass of the new particles is<br>
always less than the mass of the original particle The differ-<br>ence between the mass of the original particle and the total<br>mass of the new particles is converted into the kinetic energy<br>of the new particles (which fly away)<br>
Uphill interactions are onlv possible when kinetic energy,<br>
in addition to the energy of being (mass) of the original parti-<br>cles is available for the creation of new particles Two collid-<br>ing protons, for example, can create a proton, a neutron, and<br>a positive pion The total mass of these new particles is greater<br>than the mass of the two original protons This is possible<br>
because some of the kinetic energy of the projectile proton<br>went into the creation of the new particles<br>
In addition to mass-energy, momentum is conserved in every<br>
particle interaction The total momentum earned by particles<br>going into an interaction must equal the total momentum of<br>the particles leaving the interaction This is why the spontaneous<br>decay of a single particle alwavs produces at least two new<br>
particles A particle at rest has zero momentum If it decays<br>into a single new particle which then flies off, the momentum<br>of the new particle will exceed the momentum of the original<br>particle (zero) The momenta of at least two new particles<br>flying off in opposite directions, however, cancel each other,<br>producing a total momentum of zero<br>

total charge of the particles entering an interaction is plus two<br>(for example, two protons), the total charge of the particles<br>leaving the interaction must also equal plus two (after the<br>
positive and negative particles cancel each other) Spin, too,<br>is conserved, although keeping the books balanced in regard<br>to spin is more complicated than it is in regard to charge<br>
In addition to the conservation laws of mass-energy mo-<br>
mentum, charge, and spin, there are conservation laws of<br>family numbers For example, if two baryons, or heavy-<br>weight particles (like two protons), go into an interaction, two<br>baryons must be among the resulting new<br>
 (like a<br>
neutron and a lambda particle)<br>
This same bar) on conservation law, along with the conser-<br>
vation law of mass energy explains whv protons are stable<br>particles (i e , why thev do not decay spontaneously) Sponta-<br>neous decays must be downhill to satisfy the conservation law<br>
of mass-energy Protons cannot decay downhill without violating<br>the conservation law of baryon family numbers because protons<br>are the lightest barvons If a proton wire to decay sponta-<br>neously, it would have to decay into particles lighter than<br>itself but there are no baryons lighter than a proton In other<br>words, if a proton were to decay there would be one less<br>baryon in the world In fact, this never happens This scheme<br>(the conservation law of bar\on familv numbers) is the only<br>
way that physicists so far have been able to account for the<br>proton s stability A similar conservation law of lepton family<br>numbers accounts for the stability of electrons (There are no<br>lighter<br>
 than an electron)<br>
Some of the twelve conservation laws are actually ' invanance<br>
principles ' An invariance principle is a law that says, under<br>a change of circumstances (like changing the location of an<br>experiment) all of the laws of physics remain valid All of<br>the laws of physics,' so to speak, is the conseived quantity'<br>
of an invanance principle For example, there is a time-<br>reversal invanance principle In order for a process to be<br>possible, according to this principle, it must be reversible in<br>time If a positron-electron annihilation can create two photons<br>(it can), then the annihilation of two photons can create a<br>
positron and an electron (it can)<br>
Conservation laws and invanance principles are based on<br>
what physicists call<br>
 The fact that space is the<br>
same in all directions (isotropic) and in all places (homogene-<br>ous) is an example of symmetry The fact that time is homo-<br>

geneous is another example These symmetries simply mean<br>that a physics experiment performed in Boston this spring will<br>give the same result as the same experiment performed in<br>
Moscow next fall<br>
In other words, physicists now believe that the most<br>
fundamental laws of physics, the conservation laws and<br>mvariance principles, are based upon those foundations of our<br>reality that are so basic that thev go unnoticed This does not<br>mean (piobably) that it has taken physicists three hundred<br>
years to realize that moving an object like a telephone, around<br>the country does not distort its shape or size (space is homo-<br>geneous), nor does turning it upside down (space is isotropic),<br>nor does letting it get two weeks older (time is homogeneous)<br>Everyone knows that this is the way our physical world is<br>constructed Where and when a subatomic experiment is<br>performed are not critical data The laws of physics do not<br>
change with time and place<br>
It does mean however, that it has taken physicists three<br>
hundred vears to realize that the most simple and beautiful<br>mathematical structures may be those that are based on these<br>
 obvious conditions<br>
Theoretical physics, roughly speaking, has branched into<br>
two schools One school follows the old wav of thinking and<br>the other school follows new ways of thinking Physicists who<br>follow the old way of thinking continue their search for the<br>elementary building blocks of the universe in spite of the<br>
 predicament (page 192)<br>
For these physicists, the most likely candidate at present<br>
for the title  o f ' ultimate building block of the universe&quot; is the<br>quark A quark is a tvpe of hypothetical particle theorized by<br>Murrav GellMann in 1964 It is named after a word in James<br>Joyce s book,<br>
<i> Wake</i><br>
All known particles, the theory goes, are composed of various<br>
combinations of a few (twelve) different tvpes of quarks No<br>one has found a quark yet but many are looking It is an<br>extraordinarily elusive particle (as many now-known particles<br>were in the past) with some strange characteristics For<br>example, quarks are theorized to have 1/3 unit of electrical<br>
charge Never before has charge been found in other than<br>whole units (page 206) The great quark hunt could become<br>very exciting in the near future, but no matter what is<br>discovered in the future, one thing about it already is certain<br>

THE DANCE / 245<br>
The discovery of quarks will open an entirely new area of<br>
research, namely, What are<i> quarks</i> made<br>
The physicists who follow the new ways of thinking are<br>
pursuing so many different approaches to understanding<br>subatomic phenomena that it is not possible to present them<br>all Some of these physicists feel that space and time are all<br>that there is According to this theory, actors, action, and<br>stage are all manifestations of an underlying four-dimensional<br>geometry Others (like David Finkelstem) are exploring<br>
processes which he beneath time processes<i> from which<br></i>space and time, the very fabric of experiential reahtv, are<br>denved These theories, at the moment, are speculative They<br>cannot be 'proven (demonstrated mathematically)<br>
The most successful departure from the unending search-<br>
for-the ultimate-particle syndrome is the S-Matrix theory In<br>S-Marnx theory, the dance rather than the dancers is of primary<br>importance S-Matnx theory is different because it places the<br>emphasis upon interactions rather than upon particles<br>
S Matrix ' is short for Scattering Matrix Scattering is what<br>
happens to particles when they collide A matrix is a type of<br>mathematical table An S Matrix is a table of probabilities<br>(page 109)<br>
When subatomic particles collide several things usually are<br>
possible For example, the collision of two protons can create<br>(1) a proton, a neutron, and a positive pion, (2) a proton, a<br>lambda particle, and a positive kaon, (3) two protons and six<br>assorted pions, (4) numerous other combinations of subatomic<br>
particles Each of these possible combinations (which are the<br>combinations that do not violate the conservation laws) occurs<br>with a certain probability In other words, some of them occur<br>more often than others The probabilities of various combina-<br>tions in turn depend upon such things as<br>
 much momen-<br>
tum is carried into the collision area<br>
In an S Matrix all of these probabilities are tabulated in<br>
such a way that we can look up or calculate the possible<br>results of any collision along with their probabilities if we<br>
know what particles initially collide and how much momen-<br>tum they have Of course, there are so<br>
 possible combi-<br>
nations of particles (each one of which can yield a variety of<br>results) that a complete matrix (table) containing all the<br>
probabilities of all the possible combinations of particles would<br>be enormous In fact, such a complete table has not been<br>compiled This is no immediate problem, however, since phys-<br>

icists are concerned only with a small part of the S Matrix at<br>any one time (for example, the part which deals with two-<br>proton collisions). Such parts of the total S Matrix are called<br>elements of the S Matrix. The major limitation of S-Matrix<br>theory is that at present it applies only to the strongly<br>interacting particles (mesons and baryons), which, as a group,<br>
are called hadrons (hay'drons).<br>
Below is an S-Matrix diagram of a subatomic interaction.<br>
It is very simple. The collision area is the circle. Particles 1<br>
and 2 go into the collision area and particles 3 and 4 come out<br>of the collision area. The diagram tells nothing about what<br>happened at the point of collision. It shows only what parti-<br>cles went into the interaction and what particles came out of<br>the interaction.<br>
An S-Matrix diagram is not a space-time diagram. It does<br>
not show the position of the particles in space or time. This is<br>intentional because we do not know the exact positions of the<br>interacting particles. We have chosen to measure their mo-<br>menta and consequently their position is unknown (the<br>Heisenberg uncertainty principle). For this reason, S-Matrix<br>diagrams indicate only that an interaction took place in a cer-<br>

tain area (inside the circle). They are purely symbolic repre-<br>sentations of particle interactions.<br>
Not all interactions involve only two initial particles and<br>
two final particles. Below are some other forms that an S-<br>Matrix diagram can take.<br>
Like Feynman diagrams, S-Matrix diagrams can be rotated.<br>
The direction of the arrowheads distinguishes the particles<br>from the anti-particles. Here is an S-Matrix diagram of a proton<br>

<b>248 / I CLUTCH MY IDEAS</b><br>
colliding with a negative pion to produce a proton and a nega-<br>tive pion.<br>
When this diagram is rotated it becomes a diagram of a<br>proton/anti-proton annihilation producing a negative pion and<br>a positive pion. (The positive pion is the anti-particle of the<br>negative pion in the original reaction).<br>
Every time a diagram is rotated it depicts another possible<br>
interaction. This particular S-Matrix diagram can be rotated<br>four times. All of the particles that can be depicted by rotating<br>a single element of the S Matrix are intimately related to each<br>
other. In fact,<i> all of the particles represented in an S-Matrix<br>diagram (including those discovered by rotating the diagram)<br>are defined in terms of each other.</i> Which of them are<br>&quot;elementary&quot; is a meaningless question.<br>
Since the particles resulting from an interaction often be-<br>
come involved in other interactions, separate elements of the<br>
S Matrix can be assembled diagrammatically into a network of<br>related interactions. Each network, as well as each interac-<br>
tion, is associated with a certain probability. These probabilities<br>
can be calculated.<br>

According to S-Matrix theory, &quot;particles' are<i> intermediate</i><br>
<i>states</i> in a network of interactions. The lines in an S-Matrix<br>diagram are not the world lines of different particles. Lines in<br>
an S-Matrix diagram of an interaction network are &quot;reaction<br>channels&quot; through which energy flows. A &quot;neutron,&quot; for<br>example, is a<i> reaction channel.</i> It can be formed by a proton<br>and a negative pion.<br>

If more energy is available, however, the same channel can<br>
be created by a lambda particle and a neutral kaon, and several<br>other particle combinations as well.<br>
In short, S-Matrix theory is based upon<i> events,</i> not upon<br>
things. *,t Dancers no longer stand apart as significant entities.<br>In fact, the dancers are not even defined except in terms of<br>each other. In S-Matrix theory there is only the dance.<br>
We have come a long way from Newton and his proverbial<br>
apple. Nonetheless, apples are a real part of the apparent<br>world. When we eat an apple we are aware of who is eating<br>and what is being eaten as distinct from the action of eating.<br>
The idea that objects exist apart from events is part of the<br>
epistemological net with which we snare our particular form<br>of experience. This idea is dear to us because we have ac-<br>cepted it, without question, as the basis of our reality. It<br>

More Than Both<br>
What does physics have in common with enlightenment? Phys-<br>ics and enlightenment apparently belong to two realms which<br>are forever separate. One of them (physics) belongs to the<br>external world of physical phenomena and the other of them<br>(enlightenment) belongs to the internal world of perceptions.<br>A closer examination, however, reveals that physics and<br>enlightenment are not so incongruous as we might think. First,<br>there is the fact that only through our perceptions can we<br>
observe physical phenomena. In addition to this obvious bridge,<br>however, there are more intrinsic similarities.<br>
Enlightenment entails casting off the bonds of concept (&quot;veils<br>
of ignorance&quot;) in order to perceive directly the inexpressible<br>nature of undifferentiated reality. &quot;Undifferentiated reality&quot; is<br>the same reality that we are a part of now, and always have<br>been a part of, and always will be a part of. The difference is<br>that we do not look at it in the same way as an enlightened<br>being. As everyone knows(?), words only<i> represent (re-present)<br></i>something else. They are not real things. They are only<br>According to the philosophy of enlightenment,<i> everything</i><br>
 is a symbol. The reality of symbols is an illusory<br>
reality. Nonetheless, it is the one in which we live.<br>
Although undifferentiated reality is inexpressible, we can<br>
talk around it (using more symbols). The physical world, as it<br>appears to the unenlightened, consists of many separate parts.<br>
These separate parts, however, are not really separate. Ac-<br>cording to mystics from around the world, each moment<br>of enlightenment (grace/insight/samadhi/satori) reveals that<br>

everything—all the separate parts of the universe—are mani-<br>festations of the same whole There is only<i> one</i> reality, and it<br>is whole and unified It is one<br>
We already have learned that understanding quantum phys-<br>
ics requires a modification of ordinary conceptions (like the<br>idea that something cannot be a wave<i> and</i> a particle) Now we<br>shall see that physics may require a more complete alteration<br>of our thought processes than we ever conceived or, in fact,<br>than we ever could conceive Likewise we previously have<br>seen that quantum phenomena seem to make decisions, to<br>&quot;know&quot; what is happening elsewhere (page 62) Now we shall<br>see how quantum phenomena may be connected so intimately<br>that things once dismissed as 'occult' could become topics of<br>
serious consideration among physicists<br>
In short, both in the need to cast off ordinary thought<br>
processes (and ultimately to go beyond thought&quot; altogether),<br>and in the perception of realitv as one unity, the phenomenon<br>of enlightenment and the science of physics have much in<br>
Enlightenment is a state of being Like<i> all</i> states of being it<br>
is indescribable It is a common misconception (hterallv) to<br>mistake the description of a state of being for the state itself<br>For example, try to describe happiness It is impossible We<br>
 talk around it, we can describe the perspectives and ac-<br>
tions that usually accompany a state of happiness, but we<br>cannot descnbe happiness itself Happiness and the description<br>of happiness are two different things<br>
Happiness is a state of being That means that it exists in<br>
the realm of direct experience It is the intimate perception of<br>emotions and sensations which, indescribable in themselves,<br>
constitute the state of happiness The word &quot;happiness&quot; is the<br>label, or symbol, which we pin on this indescribable state<br>' Happiness&quot; belongs to the realm of abstractions, or concepts<br>A state of being is an<i> experience</i> A description of a state of<br>being is a<br>

 that separate<br>
parts of reality (like you and I and tugboats) mav be connected<br>in ways which both our common experience and the laws of<br>physics belie, has found its way into physics under the name<br>

of Bell's theorem Bell's theorem and quantum logic take us<br>to the farthest edges of theoretical physics Many physicists<br>have not even heard of them<br>
Bell's theorem and quantum logic (currently) are unrelated<br>
Proponents of one seldom are interested in the other None-<br>theless, they have much in common They are what is really<br><i>new</i> in physics Of course, laser fusion (fusing atoms with<br>high-energy light beams) and the search for quarks generally<br>
are considered to be the frontiers of theoretical physics * In a<br>certain sense, they are However, there is a big difference<br>between these projects and Bell's theorem and quantum logic<br>
Laser fusion research and the great quark hunt are endeavors<br>
within the existing paradigms of physics A paradigm is an<br>established thought process, a framework Both quantum logic<br>and Bell's theorem are potentially explosive in terms of existing<br>frameworks The first (quantum logic) calls us back from the<br>realm of symbols to the realm of experience The second<br>(Bell's theorem) tells us that there is no such thing as &quot;separate<br>
parts &quot; All of the ' parts&quot; of the universe are connected in an<br>intimate and immediate way previously claimed only by mys-<br>tics and other scientifically objectionable people<br>
The central mathematical element in quantum theory, the<br>
hero of the story, is the wave function The wave function is that<br>mathematical entity which allows us to determine the possible<br>results of an interaction between an observed system and an<br>observing system The celebrated position held by the wave<br>function is due not only to Erwm Schrodmger, who dis-<br>
covered it, but also to the Hungarian mathematician, John von<br>Neumann<br>
In 1932, von Neumann published a famous mathematical<br>
analysis of quantum theory called<i> The Mathematical Founda-<br>tions of Quantum Mechanics </i> In this book von Neumann, in<br>effect, asked the question, &quot;If a wave function , this purely<br>abstract mathematical creation, actually should describe<br>something in the real world, what would that something be<br>
 The answer that he deduced is exactly the description<br>
of a wave function that we already<br>
 e discussed (page 73)<br>
This strange animal constantly would change with the pas-<br>
sage of time Each moment it would be different than the<br>

of experimental physics The new frontiers of<i> theoretical</i> physics appear to be<br>sohtons and unified gauge theories<br>

moment before It would be a composite of all the possibilities<br>of the observed system which it describes It would not be a<br>simple mixture of possibilities, it would be a sort of organic<br>
whole whose parts are changing constantly but which, none-<br>theless, is somehow a thing-m-itself<br>
This thing-m-itself would continue to develop indefinitely<br>
until an observation (measurement) is made on the observed<br>system which it represents If the observed system is a<br>photon propagating in isolation the wave function repre-<br>senting this photon would contain all of the possible results of<br>the photon s interaction with a measuring device, like a pho-<br>tographic plate * (For example, the possibilities contained in<br>the wave function might be that the photon will be detected<br>
in area A of the photographic plate, that the photon will be<br>detected in area B of the photographic plate and that the<br>photon will be detected in area C of the photographic plate)<br>
Once the photon is set in motion the wave function associated<br>
with it would continue to develop (change) according to a<br>causal law (the Schrodmger wave equation) until the photon<br>interacts with the observing system At that instant, one of<br>the possibilities contained in the wave function would actualize<br>and the other possibilities contained in the wave function<br>
would cease to exist They simply would disappear The wave<br>function, that strange animal that von Neumann was attempt-<br>ing to describe, would collapse The collapse of this particu-<br>lar wave function would mean that the probability of one af<br>the possible results of the photon-measuring-device interac-<br>tion became<i> one</i> (it happened) and the probability of the other<br>possibilities became<i> zero</i> (they were no longer possible) After<br>all a photon can be detected only in one place at a time<br>
The wave function, according to this view, is not quite a<br>
thing vet it is more than an idea It occupies that strange<br>middle ground between idea and reality, where all things are<br>
possible but none are actual Heisenberg likened it to Aristot-<br>le s<i> potentia</i> (page 66)<br>
This approach has unconsciously shaped the language and<br>
therefore the thinking of most physicists, even those who<br>consider the wave function to be a mathematical fiction, an<br>abstract creation whose manipulation somehow yields the<br>

probabilities of real events which happen in real (versus math-<br>ematical) space and time<br>
Needless to say, this approach also has caused a great deal<br>
of confusion, which is as unclear today as it was in von<br>Neumann s time For example, exactly when does the wave<br>
function<br>
 (The Problem of Measurement) (page 77)<br>
Is it when the photon strikes the photographic<br>
 Is it<br>
when the photographic plate is developed? Is it when we look<br>at the developed plate'' Exactly<br>
 is it that collapses? Where<br>
does the wave function live before it<br>
 and so on<br>
This view of the wave function, that it can he described as a<br>real thing, is generally the view of the wave function attributed<br>to von Neumann However, the real-wave-function descrip-<br>tion is only one of two approaches to understanding quantum<br>phenomena which he discussed in<i> The Mathematical Founda-</i><br>
<i> of Quantum Mechanics</i><br>
The second approach, to which von Neumann devoted much<br>
less time, is a re-examination of the language bv which it is<br>
necessary to express quantum phenomena In the section,<br>' Projections as Propositions, ' he wrote<br>
the relation between the properties of a physical system<br>
on the one hand, and the projections [wave function] on<br>the other, makes possible a sort of logical calculus with<br>these However, in contrast to the concepts of ordinary<br>logic, this system is extended by the concepts of simulta-<br>neous decidability [the uncertainty principle] which is<br>characteristic for quantum mechanics 2<br>
This suggestion, that the novel properties of quantum theory<br>
can be used to construct a logical calculus which is in<br>
contrast to the concepts of ordinary logic, is what von Neumann<br>considered the<br>
 e to describing wave functions as real<br>
things<br>
Most physicists, however, have adopted a third explanation<br>
of wave functions Thev dismiss them as purely mathematical<br>constructions, abstract fictions which represent nothing in the<br>world of<br>
 Unfortunately, this explanation leaves forever<br>
unanswered the question, &quot;How, then, can wave functions<br>
predict so accurately probabilities which can be verified through<br>actual<br>
 In fact, how can wave functions predict<br>
<i>anything</i> when they are defined as completely unrelated to<br>physical reality This is a scientific version of the philosophical<br>question, &quot;How can mind influence<br>

Von Neumann s second approach to understanding the par-<br>
adoxical puzzles of quantum phenomena took him far bevond<br>the boundaries of physics This brief work pointed to a fusion<br>of ontology epistemologv and psychology which only now is<br>
beginning to emerge In short, the problem, said von Neumann,<br>
is in the language Herein lies the germ of what was to be-<br>
come quantum logic<br>
In pointing to the problem of language, von Neumann put<br>
his finger on why it is so difficult to answer the question,<br>
What is quantum<br>
 Mechanics is the study of<br>
motion Therefore, quantum mechanics is the study of the<br>motion of quanta—but what are<br>
 According to the<br>
dictionary a quantum is a quantity of something The ques-<br>tion is, a quantity of<br>
A quantum is a piece of action (a piece of the<br>
 The<br>
problem is that a quantum can be like a wave and then again<br>it can be like a particle, which is everything that a wave isn't<br>Furthermore when a quantum is like a particle, it is not like<br>
a particle in the ordinary sense of the word A subatomic<br>
particle' is not a thing ' (We cannot determine simultaneously<br>
its position and momentum) A subatomic particle' (quantum)<br>is a set of relationships, or an intermediate state It can be<br>broken up, but out of the breaking come more particles as<br>
elementary as the original Those who are not shocked<br>when they first come across quantum theory, ' said Niels Bohr,<br>
cannot possibly have understood it ' 3<br>
Quantum theory is not difficult to explain because it is<br>
complicated Quantum theory is difficult to explain because<br>the words which we must use to communicate it are not<br>adequate for explaining quantum phenomena This was well<br>known and much discussed by the founders of quantum theory<br>Max Born for example wrote<br>
The ultimate origin of the difficulty lies in the fact (or<br>philosophical principle) that we are compelled to use<br>words of common language when we wish to describe<br>a phenomenon, not by logical or mathematical analysis,<br>but by a picture appealing to the imagination Common<br>language has grown by everyday experience and can<br>never surpass these limits Classical physics has restricted<br>itself to the use of concepts of this kind by<br>visible motions it has developed two ways of represent-<br>
ing them by elementary processes moving particles and<br>waves There is no other wav of giving a pictorial<br>

description of motions—we have to apply it even in the<br>region of atomic process, \vhere classical physics break<br>down 4<br>
This is the view currently held by most physicists We<br>
encounter problems explaining subatomic phenomena when<br>
we try tor visualize them Therefore, it is necessary to forego<br>explanations in terms of' common language and restrict our-<br>selves to &quot;mathematical analysis &quot; To learn the physics of<br>subatomic phenomena we first must learn mathematics<br>
'Not so'&quot; says David Finkelstem Director of the School of<br>
Physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology<br>
 s,<br>
like English, also is a language It is constructed of symbols<br>&quot;The best you can get with symbols is a maximal but incom-<br>plete description ' 3 A mathematical analysis of subatomic<br>phenomena is no better<br>
 than any other symbolic<br>
analysis, because<i> symbols do not follou. the same rules</i><br>
 They follow rules of their own In short, the prob-<br>
lem is not<i> in</i> the language, the problem<i> is</i> the language<br>
The difference between experience and symbol is the dif-<br>
ference between mythos and logos Logos imitates, but can<br>never replace experience It is a<br>
 for experience<br>
Logos is the artificial construction of dead symbols which mim-<br>ics experience on a one-to-one basis Classical physical theory<br>
is an example of a one-to-one correspondence between theory<br>and reality<br>
Einstein argued that no physical theory is complete unless<br>
every element in the real world has a definite counterpart in<br>the theory Einstein s theory of relati\ ity is the last great<br>classical theory (even though it is a part of the new physics)<br>
because it is structured in a one-to-one way with phenomena<br>
Unless a phvsical theory has one-to-one correspondence with<br>
phenomena, argued Einstein it is not complete<br>
Whatever the meaning assigned to the term<i> complete,<br></i>the following requirement for a complete theory seems to<br>be a necessary one<i> every element of the physical reality<br>must have a counterpart in the physical theory</i> 6 (Italics<br>in the original)<br>

events—only probabilities) According to quantum theory, in-<br>dividual events are chance happenings There are no theoretical<br>elements in quantum theory to correspond with each individ-<br>ual event that actually happens Therefore quantum theory,<br>according to Einstein, is incomplete This was a basic issue of<br>the famous Bohr-Einstein debates<br>
Mythos points toward experience, but it does not replace<br>
experience Mythos is the opposite of intellectuahsm Cere-<br>monial chants at primitive rituals (like football games) are<br>
good examples of mythos They endow experience with value,<br>originality and vitality, but they do not seek to replace it<br>
Theologically speaking, logos is the original sin, the eating<br>
of the fruit of knowledge, the expulsion from the Garden of<br>
Eden Historically speaking, logos is the growth of the literary<br>
revolution, the birth of the written tradition out of the oral<br>tradition From any point of view, logos (literally) is a dead<br>letter &quot;Knowledge,&quot; wrote e e cummings, &quot;is a polite word<br>for / dead but not buried imagination &quot; He was talking about<br>logos<br>
Our problem, according to Fmkelstem, is that we cannot<br>
understand subatomic phenomena,<i> or any other kind of</i><br>
<i>experience,</i> through the use of symbols alone As Heisenberg<br>observed<br>
The concepts initially formed by abstraction from particu-<br>lar situations or experiential complexes acquire a<i> life of<br>their own 7</i> (Italics added)<br>
Getting lost in the interaction of symbols is analogous to<br>
mistaking the shadows on the wall of the cave for the real<br>
world outside the cave (which is direct experience) The an-<br>swer to this predicament is to approach subatomic phenomena,<br>as well as experience in general, with a language of mythos<br>rather than a language of logos<br>
Fmkelstem put it this way<br>
If you want to envision a quantum as a dot then you are<br>trapped You are modeling it with classical logic The<br>
whole point is that there<i> is no</i> classical representation for<br>it We have to learn to live with the experience<br>

According to Finkelstem, a language of mythos, a language<br>
which alludes to experience but does not attempt to replace it<br>or to mold our perception of it is the true language of physics<br>This is because not only the language that we use to commu-<br>nicate our daily experience, but also mathematics, follows a<br>certain set of rules (classical logic)<i> Experience itself is not<br>bound by these rules</i> Experience follows a much more per-<br>missive set of rules (quantum logic) Quantum logic is not<br>only more exciting than classical logic, it is more real It is<br>based not upon the way that we<i> think</i> of things, but upon<br>the way that we<i> experience</i> them<br>
When we trv to describe experience with classical logic<br>
(which is what we have been doing since we learned to write),<br>
we put on a set of blinders, so to speak, which not only<br>restricts our field of vision, but also distorts it These blinders<br>are the set of rules known as classical logic The rules of<br>classical logic are well defined They are simple The only<br>problem is that they do not correspond to experience<br>
The most important difference between the rules of classi-<br>
cal logic and the rules of quantum logic involves the law of<br>distnbutivity The law of distnbutivity, or the distributive<br>law, says that &quot;A, and B or C&quot; is the same as &quot;A and B, or A<br>and C &quot; In other words, &quot;I flip a coin and it comes up heads<br>
or tails&quot; has the same meaning as ' I flip a coin and it comes<br>up heads, or I flip a coin and it comes up tails &quot; The distributive<br>law, which is a foundation of classical logic,<i> does not apply to<br>quantum logic</i> This is one of the most important but least<br>understood aspects of von Neumann's work In 1936, von<br>Neumann and his colleague, Garrett Birkhoff, published a<br>paper which laid the foundations of quantum logic 9<br>

Polarizers are a special kind of light filter Most frequently<br>
they are made of stretched sheets of plastic material in which<br>all the molecules are elongated and aligned in the same direc-<br>tion Under magnification the molecules look something like<br>this<br>
These long, slender molecules are responsible for the polariza-<br>
tion of the light which passes through them<br>
The<br>
 of light can be understood most easily as a<br>
wave phenomenon Light waves from an ordinary light source,<br>like the sun emanate in every fashion, vertically, horizontally,<br>and every way in between This does not mean only that light<br>radiates from a source in all directions It means that in any<br>

given beam of light some of the light waves are vertical, some<br>of the light waves are horizontal some are diagonal, and so<br>forth To a light wave, a polarizer looks something like a<br>
picket fence Whether it can get through the fence or not<br>depends upon whether it is aligned with the fence or not If<br>the polarizer is aligned vertically only the vertical light waves<br>make it through All of the other light waves are obstructed<br>(first illustration) All of the light waves that pass through<br>a vertical polarizer are aligned vertically This light is called<br>vertically polarized light<br>
If the polarizer is aligned horizontally, only the horizontal<br>
light waves make it through All of the other light waves are<br>obstructed (second illustration) All of the light waves that<br>pass through a horizontal polarizer are aligned horizontally<br>
This light is called horizontally polarized light<br>
No matter how the polarizer is aligned all of the light<br>
waves passing through it are aligned in the same plane The<br>arrows on the polarizers indicate the direction in which the<br>light passing through them is polarized (which way the mole-<br>cules in the plastic are elongated)<br>

Take one of the polarizers and hold it with the arrow pointing<br>
up (or down). The light coming through this polarizer now is<br>polarized vertically. Now take another polarizer and hold it<br>behind the first polarizer with its arrow also pointing up (or<br>down). Notice that, except for a slight attenuation due to the<br>tint, all of the light that gets through the first polarizer also<br>gets through the second polarizer.<br>
Now rotate one of the polarizers from vertical to horizontal.<br>
As it is rotated, notice that less and less light gets through the<br>pair. When one of the polarizers is vertical and the other<br>
polarizer is horizontal, no light gets through them at all. The<br>first polarizer eliminates all but the horizontally polarized light<br>waves. They are eliminated by the second polarizer, which<br>passes only vertically polarized light. The result is that no<br>light passes both the vertical and the horizontal polarizer. It<br>does not matter whether the first polarizer is vertical and the<br>second polarizer is horizontal or the other way round. The<br>order of the filters is not important. In either case, no light<br>
passes through them.<br>

Whenever two polarizers are oriented at right angles to<br>
each other they block all light. No matter how the pair is<br>twisted or turned as a unit, as long as they remain at right<br>angles to each other, no light passes through them.<br>
With this in mind, we come now to the third filter. Align<br>
the third filter so that it polarizes light<i> diagonally</i> and place it<br>in front of the horizontal polarizer and the vertical polarizer.<br>Nothing happens. If the first two filters (the horizontal and<br>the vertical polarizer) block all the light, the addition of a<br>third filter, of course, scarcely can affect the situation.<br>

In a similar manner, if we place the diagonal polarizer on<br>

Now we come to the interesting part. Put the diagonal<br>
polarizer<i> between</i> the horizontal polarizer and the vertical<br>polarizer.<i> Light gets through the three filters when they are<br>placed in this order!</i><br>
In other words, a combination of horizontal and vertical<br>
polarizers is as much a barrier to light waves as a wooden<br>door. A diagonal polarizer in front of or behind such a combi-<br>nation does not affect this phenomenon. However, if a diago-<br>nal polarizer is sandwiched in<i> between</i> the horizontal polarizer<br>and the vertical polarizer, light gets through all three of them.<br>Remove the diagonal polarizer and the light disappears again.<br>

A &quot;bishawn&quot; is what physicists call a coherent superposition<br>
A ' superposition&quot; is one thing (or more) imposed on another<br>A double<br>

Diagonally polarized light is a coherent superposition of<br>
 pulan/ed light and vertically<br>
 light<br>
Quantum physics abounds with coherent superpositions In<br>
fact, coherent superpositions are at the heart of the mathe-<br>
matics of quantum mechanics Wave functions are coherent<br>superpositions<br>
Even qauntuin mechanical experiment has an observed<br>
system Everv observed system has an associated<br>
 function<br>
The wave function of a particular<br>
 (like a<br>
photon) is the coherent superposition of all the possible results<br>of an interaction between the observed system and a measur-<br>ing systtm (like a photographic plate) The development in<br>time of this coherent superposition of possibilities is described<br>by<br>
 wave equation Using this equation, we can<br>
calculate the form of this thing-m-itself, this coherent super-<br>position of possibilities which we call a wave function for any<br>given time Having done<i> that</i> we then can calculate the<br><i>probability</i> of each possibility contained in the wave function<br>at that particular time This gives us a probability function,<br>
which is not the same as a wave function, but is calculated<br>from a wave function In a nutshell, that is the mathematics of<br>quantum physics<br>
In other words, in the mathematical formulations of quantum<br>
theory nothing is either &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot; with nothing in be-<br>tween Graduate students in physics routinely learn the math-<br>ematical technique of superimposing everv 'this&quot; on every<br>&quot;that&quot; in such a<br>
 that the result is neither the original<br>
&quot;this&quot; nor the original &quot;that,&quot; but an entirely new thing called<br>a coherent superposition of the two<br>
According to Finkelstem, one of the major conceptual diffi-<br>
culties of quantum mechanics is the false idea that these wave<br>functions (coherent superpositions) aie real<i> things</i> which de-<br>velop, collapse, etc On the other hand, the idea that coher-<br>ent superpositions are pure abstractions which represent nothing<br>

that we encounter m our daily lives also is incorrect They<br>reflect the nature of<i> experience</i><br>
How do coherent superpositions reflect experience'1 Pure<br>
experience is never restricted to merely two possibilities Our<br><i>conceptualization</i> of a given situation may create the illusion<br>that each dilemma has onl&gt; two horns, but this illusion is<br>caused bv assuming that experience is bound by the same<br>rules as symbols In the world of symbols,<br>
 is either<br>
this or that In the \\orld of experience there are more alter-<br>natives available<br>
For example, consider the judge who must try his own son<br>
in a court of law The law allows onlv two verdicts &quot;He is<br>guiltv&quot; and &quot;He is innocent &quot; For the judge, however, there<br>is another possible verdict, namelv, &quot;He is<i> my</i> son &quot; The fact<br>
that we prohibit judges from trying cases in which thev have a<br>personal interest is a tacit admission that experience is not<br>limited to the categorical alternatives of &quot;guilty&quot; and &quot;inno-<br>cent&quot; (or 'good' and &quot;bad,&quot; etc ) Onlv m the realm of symbols<br>is the choice so clear<br>
During the Lebanese civil war, a story goes, a visiting Amer-<br>
ican was stopped by a group of masked gunmen One wrong<br>word could cost him his life<br>
'Are you Christian or Moslem'1' they asked<br>'I am a<br>

The<br>
 that we pose DIM questions often illusorily limits<br>
our responses In this case, the visitor's fear for his life broke<br>
through this illusion Sun larly, the way that we<i> think our<br>thoughts</i> illusorily limits us to a perspective of either/or<br>Experience itself is never so limited There is always an alter-<br>
native between every &quot;this&quot; and every &quot;that &quot; The recognition<br>of this quality of experience is an integral part of quantum<br>

not expect him to say, &quot;Prove it &quot; However, when a physicist<br>
says, Experience is not bound by the same rules as symbols,&quot;<br>

Physicists are not very impressed with opinions Unfortunately,<br>
this sometimes makes them nairowmmded to an extraordinary<br>degree If you are not willing to follow<i> their</i> dance, they won't<br>dante with you<br>
Their dance requires a &quot;proof for every assertion A &quot;proof<br>
does not verify that an assertion is &quot;true&quot; (that that is the way<br>the world really is) A scientific ' proof is a mathematical<br>demonstration that the assertion in question is logically<br>sistent In the realm of pure mathematics, an assertion may<br>have no relevance to experience at all Nonetheless, if it is<br>accompanied by a self-consistent 'proof it is accepted If it is<br>not, it is rejected The same is true of physics except that the<br>science of physics imposes the additional requirement that<br>
the assertion relate to<br>
 reahtv<br>
So much for 'he relationship between the &quot;truth' of a<br>
scientific assertion and the nature of reahtv There isn t any<br>Scientific 'truth&quot; has nothing to do with the way that reality<br>really is &quot; A scientific theory is &quot;true if it is self-consistent<br>and correctly correlates experience (predicts events) In short,<br>
when a scientist says that a theory is true, he means that it<br>correctly correlates experience and, therefore, it is useful If<br>we substitute the word 'useful&quot; whenever we encounter the<br>word &quot;true,&quot; physics appears in its proper perspective<br>
Birkhoffand von Neumann created a 'proof that experience<br>
violates the rules of classical logic This proof of course, is<br>embedded in experience In particular, it is based upon what<br>does and does not happen with various combinations of<br>polarized light Finkelstem uses a shghtlv modified  ersion of<br>Birkhoff and von Neumann's original proof to demonstrate<br>
quantum logic<br>
The first step of this proof is to experiment with all of the<br>
possible combinations of horizontally, vertically, and diago-<br>nally polarized light In other words, the first step is to do<br>
what we have done already, discover which light emissions<br>pass through which polarizers Observe for yourself that light<br>passes through two vertical polarizers, two horizontal polarizers,<br>two diagonal polarizers, a diagonal and a horizontal polarizer,<br>and a diagonal and a vertical polarizer All of these combina-<br>tions are called &quot;allowed transitions&quot; because they actually<br>happen Similarly, observe for yourself that light does not<br>pass through a horizontal and a vertical polarizer, or any other<br>combination of polarizers oriented at right angles to each other<br>

These combinations are called &quot;forbidden transitions&quot; because<br>they never happen<br>
The second step of the proof is to make a table of this<br>

The row of letters on the left are emissions An emission is<br>
just what it sounds like In this case, an emission is a light<br>
wave that is emitted from a light bulb The &quot;)&quot; sign to the<br>right of a letter indicates an emission For example, &quot;H)&quot;<br>
means horizontally polarized light emitting from a horizontal<br>
polarizer The row of letters on the top are admissions An<br>admission is the reception of an emission The &quot;)&quot; sign to the<br>left of a letter indicates an admission For example, &quot;)H&quot;<br>means a horizontally polarized light wave reaching an eyeball<br>
The zeros with the lines through them (pronounced &quot;oh&quot;)<br>
stand for the &quot;null process &quot; The null process means that we<br>

decided to go to the movies today and not do the experiment.<br>
The null process stands for no emissions, nothing. The letter<br>
&quot;I&quot; stands for &quot;identity process.&quot; The identity process is a filter<br>that passes everything. In other words, &quot;I&quot; tells us what kinds<br>
of polarized light pass through, say, an open window: namely,<br>every kind.<br>
Two kinds of diagonally polarized light are included in the<br>
table to make it complete. The &quot;D&quot; represents light diago-<br>nally polarized to the left, and the &quot;D&quot; represents light diago-<br>nally polarized to the right (or the other way round).<br>
To use the transition table we pick the type of emission in<br>
which we are interested and follow it across the table. For<br>example, an emission of horizontally polarized light, H), will<br>pass through another horizontal polarizer, so an &quot;A,&quot; for al-<br>lowed, is placed in the square where the horizontally polarized<br>emission line intersects the horizontally polarized admission<br>
column. Horizontally polarized light also passes through a<br>

diagonal polarizer tilted to the left, )D, a diagonal polarizer<br>tilted to the right, )D, and an open window, I. An &quot;A&quot; is<br>placed in each appropriate square.<br>
Notice that the square where the horizontally polarized<br>
emission line intersects the vertically polarized admission col-<br>umn is hlank. This is because horizontally polarized light does<br>
not pass through a vertical polarizer. The blank<br>
 show<br>
the forbidden transitions. All of the null process squares are<br>blank because nothing happens if we don't do the experiment.<br>
All of the &quot;I&quot; squares are marked &quot;A&quot; because every kind of<br>light, polarized and otherwise, passes through an open window.<br>
The third step in the proof is to make a simple diagram of<br>
the information contained in the transition table. The diagram<br>made from this particular transition table looks like this:<br>
SINGUTS<br>
<b>NUU PROCESS</b><br>
This type of diagram is called a lattice. Mathematicians use<br>
lattices to show the ordering of events or elements. Lattices<br>are similar to the genealogical trees that we construct when<br>we research our family roots. The higher elements include<br>the lower elements. The lines show who is connected to whom<br>
and through whom.<br>
A lattice is not exactly a family tree, but it shows the same<br>
kind of inclusive ordering. At the bottom is the null process.<br>Nothing is below the null process since the null process<br>represents no emissions of any kind. In the next level up are<br>the various states of polarization. The elements at this level<br>
are called singlets. Singlets are the simplest statements that<br>we can make about the polarization of a light wave. &quot;This light<br>is horizontally polarized,&quot; is the most that we can say about<br>the state of polarization, even though it doesn't tell us any-<br>

The next level up contains the doublets In this lattice there<br>
is only one doublet Doublets comprise the next level of max-<br>imal but incomplete statements that we can make about the<br>polarization of light in this simple experiment Lattices repre-<br>senting more complex phenomena can have considerably more<br>levels—triplets, quadruplets, etc This lattice is the simplest<br>
of them all, but it graphically demonstrates the nature of<br>quantum logic<br>
First, notice that the doublet, I, contains/our singlets This<br>
is typical of quantum logic but an incomprehensible contra-<br>diction to classical logic wherein eveiy doublet, by definition,<br>contains only<i> two</i> singlets, no more and no less Lattices are<br>graphic demonstrations of the quantum postulate that there is<br>always at least one alternative between every &quot;this&quot; and every<br>
'that &quot; In this case, two alternatives ( D&quot; and<br>
 are<br>
represented There are manv more available alternatives that<br>are not represented in this lattic For example, the light in<br>the lattice represented by the symbol, D, is diagonally polarized<br>at 45°, but we also can polarize light at 46°, 47°, 481/2°, etc , and<br>all of these states of polarization could be included in the<br>doublet, I<br>
In both classical logic and quantum logic a singlet can be<br>
represented bv a dot In classical logic a doublet is represented<br>by two dots In quantum logic, however, a doublet is repre-<br>sented by a line drawn between the two dots<i> All of the points<br>on the line</i> are included in the doublet—not onlv the two<br>

To see how two elements in the lattice are connected by<br>
the word, &quot;or,&quot; follow the lines leading from the elements in<br>question<i> up</i> to a point where they both meet (which mathe-<br>maticians call the &quot;least upper bound&quot;) For example, if we<br>are interested in &quot;H or V,&quot; we follow the lines<i> upward</i> from<br>H and from V and find that they meet at I Therefore, the<br>lattice tells us that &quot;H or V&quot; equals &quot;I &quot; Similarly, to find &quot;D<br>
o- I,&quot; we follow the lines<i> upward</i> to their highest common<br>point, which is I Therefore, the lattice tells us that &quot;D or I&quot;<br>
 &quot;I &quot;<br>

erably simpler than the preliminary explanations The distrib-<br>utive law says that &quot;A, and B or C&quot; equals &quot;A and B, or A and<br>

C.&quot; To see whether this is true of experience or not we simply<br>insert some of our actual states of polarization into the formula<br>and solve it using the lattice method. For example, the<br>distributive law says that &quot;Horizontally polarized light and<br>vertically polarized light or diagonally polarized light&quot; equals<br>&quot;Horizontally polarized light and vertically polarized light, or<br>
horizontally polarized light and diagonally polarized light.&quot;<br>
Using the abbreviations that we already have used, this is<br>
written: &quot;H, and D or V&quot; equals &quot;H and D, or H andV.&quot;<br>
Returning to the lattice, let us examine the left side of this<br>
statement first. Solving for &quot;D or V,&quot; we follow the lines on<br>
the lattice upward from D and from V to their highest common<br>
point (&quot;or&quot; goes<i> up).</i> They meet at I. Therefore, the lattice<br>tells us that &quot;D or V&quot; equals &quot;I.&quot; Substituting &quot;I&quot; for the<br>original &quot;D or V,&quot; we have left on this side of the statement<br>&quot;H and I.&quot; Following the lines from H and from I downward<br>on the lattice (&quot;and&quot; goes<i> down),</i> we find that their lowest<br>common point is at H. Therefore, the lattice tells us that &quot;H<br>and I&quot; equals &quot;H.&quot;<br>
In short:<br>
&quot;H, and D or V&quot; equals &quot;H and D, or H andV&quot;<br>
&quot;H and I&quot; equals &quot;H and D, or H and V&quot;<br>
&quot;H&quot; equals &quot;H and D, or H and V&quot;<br>
We solve the right side of this statement in the same way.<br>
Solving for &quot;H and D,&quot; we follow the lines on the lattice<br>
downward from H and from D to their lowest common point.<br>They meet at 0. Therefore, the lattice tells us that &quot;H and D&quot;<br>equals &quot;0.&quot;<br>

Substituting &quot;0&quot; for &quot;H and D,&quot; we are left with &quot;0, or H<br>and V&quot; on the right side of the statement. To solve for &quot;H and<br>
V,&quot; we follow the lines on the lattice downward from H and<br>from V to their lowest common point. They also intersect at<br>0. Therefore, the lattice tells us that &quot;H and V&quot; equals &quot;0.&quot;<br>
Substituting &quot;0&quot; for &quot;H and V&quot; we now are left with &quot;0 or 0&quot;<br>
on the right side of the original statement. Both the lattice<br>and common sense tell us that &quot;0 or 0&quot; equals &quot;0.&quot;<br>
In short:<br>
&quot;H&quot; equals &quot;H and D, or H and V&quot;<br>&quot;H&quot; equals &quot;0, or H and V&quot;<br>&quot;H&quot; equals &quot;0 or 0&quot;<br>&quot;H&quot; equals &quot;0&quot;<br>

Finkelstein's theory is a theory<i> of process.</i> Quantum logic is<br>
only one part of it. According to this theory, the basic unit of<br>the universe is an event, or a process. These events link in<br>certain ways (allowed transitions) to form webs. The webs in<br>turn join to form larger webs. Farther up the ladder of organ-<br>ization are coherent superpositions of different webs (things<br>which are neither &quot;this web&quot; nor &quot;that web&quot; but distinct entities<br>in themselves).<br>
The basic events of Finkelstein's theory do not exist in<br>
space and time. They are prior to space and time. According<br>to Finkelstein,<i> space, time, mass, and energy are secondary</i><br>

 which are derived from the basic events of the<br>
universe. In fact, Finkelstein's latest paper is called &quot;Beneath<br>Time.&quot;<br>
This bold theory is a radical departure from conventional<br>
physics and from conventional thought. The mathematics of<br>
Finkelstein's theory, which is called quantum topology, is<br>remarkably simple compared to the complex mathematics of<br>
quantum theory and relativity. Quantum topology is as yet<br>incomplete (lacking &quot;proof). Like many theories, it may never<br>be complete. Unlike most other theories, however, it contains<br>the wtential to alter radically our conceptual framework.<br>
Von Neumann's discovery that our thought processes (the<br>
realm of symbols) project illusory restrictions onto the real<br>word is essentially the same discovery that led Einstein to<br>the general theory of relativity. Einstein disproved the<br>universality of Euclidean geometry. Until the general theory<br>
of relativity, Euclidean geometry had been accepted without<br>question as the underlying structure of the universe. Birkhoff<br>and von Neumann disproved the universality of classical logic.<br>Until now, classical logic has been accepted without question<br>as a natural reflection of the nature of reality.<br>
A powerful awareness lies dormant in these discoveries: an<br>
awareness of the hitherto-unsuspected powers of the mind to<br>mold &quot;reality,&quot; rather than the other way round. In this sense,<br>the philosophy of physics is becoming indistinguishable from<br>the philosophy of Buddhism, which is the philosophy of<br>
enlightenment.<br>

A vital aspect of the enlightened state is the experience of an<br>all-pervading unity. &quot;This&quot; and &quot;that&quot; no longer are separate<br>entities. They are different/orms of the same thing. Everything<br>is a<i> manifestation.</i> It is not possible to answer the question,<br>&quot;Manifestation of<i> what?&quot;</i> because the &quot;what&quot; is that which is<br>beyond words, beyond concept, beyond form, beyond even<br>space and time. Everything is a manifestation of that which is.<br>
That which is, is. Beyond these words lies the experience; the<br>experience of that which is.<br>
The forms through which that which is manifests itself are<br>
each and every one of them perfect.<i> We</i> are manifestations of<br>that which is.<br>
 is a manifestation of that which is.<br>
Everything and<br>
 is exactly and perfectly what it is.<br>

 Tibetan Buddhist, Longchenpa, wrote:<br>

world,&quot; except that according to the enlightened view, the<br>world couldn't be any other way. It is neither well nor not<br>well. It simply is what it is. What it is is perfectly what it is. It<br>couldn't be anything else. It is perfect. I am perfect. I am<br>exactly and perfectly who I am. You are perfect. You are<br>exactly and perfectly who you are.<br>

If we substitute ' subatomic particles&quot; for people in this<br>
scheme, we have a good approximation of the conceptual<br>dynamics of particle physics Yet, there is another sense in<br>which this aspect of unity has entered physics The pioneers<br>of quantum physics noticed a strange ' connectedness&quot; among<br>quantum phenomena Until<br>
 this oddity lacked any<br>
theoretical significance It was regarded as an accidental fea-<br>ture which would be explained as the theory developed<br>
In 1964, J S Bell, a ph\sicist at the European Organiza-<br>
tion for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland, zeroed in<br>on this strange connectedness in a manner that may make it<br>the central focus of physics in the future Dr Bell published a<br>mathematical proof which came to be known as Bell's theorem<br>Bell s theorem was reworked and refined over the following<br>ten years until it emerged in its present form Its present<br>
form is dramatic, to say the least<br>
Bell s theorem is a mathematical construct which, as such,<br>
is indecipherable to the nonmathematician Its implications,<br>however, could affect profoundly our basic world view Some<br>physicists are convinced that it is the most important single<br>
work, perhaps in the history of physics One of the implica-<br>tions of Bell s theorem is that, at a deep and fundamental<br>level, the separate parts of the universe are connected in an<br>intimate and immediate way<br>
In short, Bell's theorem and the enlightened experience of<br>
unity are very compatible<br>
The unexplained connectedness of quantum phenomena<br>
shows itself in several ways The first way we alreadv have<br>
discussed It is the double-slit experiment (page 60) When<br>
both slits in a double-slit experiment are open, the light waves<br>going through them interfere with each other to form a pat-<br>tern of alternating light and dark bands on a screen When<br>only one slit in a double-slit experiment is open, the light<br>

waves going through it illuminate the screen in the ordinary<br>wav How does a single photon in a double-slit experiment<br>know whether or not it can go to an area on the screen that<br>must be dark if both slits are<br>
The great multitude of photons of which a single photon<br>
eventually will be a part distributes itself in one way if one slit<br>is open and in an entirely different way if both slits are open<br>The question is, assuming that a single photon goes through<br>one of the two slits<i> how does it know whether or not the<br>other slit is</i><br>
 Somehow it does An interference pattern<br>

when we close one of the slits<br>
However there is another experiment in which this appar-<br>
ent connectedness of quantum phenomena is even more<br>perplexing Suppose that we have what physicists call a two-<br>particle system of zero spin This means that the spin of each of<br>the particles in the system cancels the other If one of the<br>particles in such a system has a spin<i> up</i> the other particle has<br>
a spin<i> down</i> If the first particle has a spin<i> right</i> the second<br>particle has a spin<i> left</i> No matter how the particles are oriented<br>their spins are always equal and opposite<br>
Now suppose that we separate these two particles in some<br>
wav that does not affect their spin (like electrically) One<br>
particle goes off in one direction and the other particle goes<br>
off in the opposite direction<br>
The spin of a subatomic particle can be oriented by a mag-<br>
netic field For example if a beam of electrons with randomly<br>oriented spin is sent through a particular type of magnetic<br>field (called a Stern-Gerlach device) the magnetic field splits<br>the beam into two equal smaller beams In one of them all of<br>the electrons have a spin<i> up</i> and in the other all of the electrons<br>have a spin<i> down</i> If onlv one electron goes through this<br>magnetic field it will come out of it with either a spin<i> up</i> or a<br>spin<i> down</i> (We can design the experiment so that the odds<br>are 50-50) (first drawing next page)<br>
If we reorientate the magnetic field (change its axis) we can<br>
give all of the electrons a spin<i> right</i> or a spin<i> left</i> instead of a<br>spin up or a spin down If only one electron goes through the<br>magnetic field when it is oriented this way, it will come out of<br>it with either a spin<br>
 or a spin<i> left</i> (equal chance either<br>
way) (second drawing, next page)<br>
Now suppose that after we separate our original two-particle<br>
system we send one of the particles through a magnetic field<br>
<hr>
<A name=298></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-298_1.png"><br>
284 / ENLIGHTENMENT<br>
that will give it either a spin<i> up</i> or a spin<i> down.</i> In this case,<br>let us say that the particle comes out of the magnetic field<br>
with a spin<i> up.</i> This means that we automatically know that<br>the other particle has a spin<i> down.</i> We do not have to make a<br>measurement on the other particle because we know that its<br>spin is equal to and opposite to that of its twin.<br>

The original two-particle system with<br>
 spin is at the<br>
center. One of the particles goes to area A. In area A it goes<br>through a Stern-Gerlach device. In this case, the Stern-<br>Gerlach device gives it a spin<i> up.</i> Therefore, we know<i> without</i><br>
<i>measuring</i> that the other particle, which has gone to area B,<br>has a spin<i> down.</i><br>
Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen thought<br>
up this experiment over forty-five years ago. Actually, this<br>version of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment (using spin<br>states) was thought up by David Bohm, a physicist at the<br>
University of London. This version usually is used to illustrate<br>the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect. (The original paper dealt<br>
with positions and momenta).<br>
In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen published their<br>
thought experiment in a paper entitled, &quot;Can Quantum-<br>
Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered<br>
Complete?&quot;2 At that time, Bohr, Heisenberg, and the pro-<br>ponents of the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Me-<br>chanics (page 37), were saying that quantum theory is a<br>complete theory even though it doesn't provide any picture of<br>the world separate from our observations of it. (They're still<br>saying it.) The message that Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen<br>wanted to convey to their colleagues was that the quantum<br>theory is<i> not</i> a &quot;complete&quot; theory because it does not describe<br>certain important aspects of reality which are physically real<br>even if they are not observed. The message that their col-<br>leagues got, however, was quite different. The message that<br>their colleagues got was that the particles in the Einstein-<br>
PodoLsky-Rosen thought experiment somehow are connected<br>in a way that transcends our usual ideas about casuality.<br>
For example, if the axis of the Stern-Gerlach device in our<br>
hypothetical experiment were changed to make the particles<br>

At once<br>
 that this peculiar situation raises<br>
a critical question How can two of anything communicate so<br>
According to the usual ideas in physics information is car-<br>
ried from one place to another by a signal Without a carrier<br>there is no communication For example the most common<br>form of communication is talking The information that we<br>convey by talking is carried (in a face-to-face conversation) by<br>sound waves Sound<br>
 only travel so fast (about 700 miles<br>
per hour)<i> 1</i> herefore how long it takes mv information to get<br>from me to you depends upon how far awav from me you are<br>The fastest communication signal is an electromagnetic wave<br>like a light wa\e or a radio wave These travel at approxi-<br>mately 186 (XX) miles per second Almost all of ph\sics rests<br>upon the assumption that<i> nothing in the universe can travel<br>faster than the speed of</i><br>
<i> *</i> The extraoi<br>
 high velocity<br>
of light makes communication bv light signal<br>
 instanta<br>
neons I seem to see &gt;ou nod your head at the moment that<br>you actually do it Nonetheless communication bv light signal<br>is not instantaneous How long it takes mv information to<br>travel via light signal from me to you depends upon how far<br>
 from me vou are In most instances the travel time<br>
required is so brief that it scarcely can be measured It takes<br>several seconds however for a radio signal to travel from the<br>earth to the moon and back<br>
Now suppose that area A and area B are very far apart It<br>
will take a certain amount of tune for a light signal to travel<br>from area A to area B If area A and area B are so far apart<br>that there is insufficient time for a light signal to connect an<br>event that happens in area A with an event that happens in<br>area B, there is no wav according to the usual ideas in phys<br>ics, that the event in area B can know about the event in area<br>A Physicists call this a space like<br>

time for a light signal to connect them.) Communication be-<br>tween space-like separated events defies one of the most basic<br>assumptions of physics. Yet this is exactly what the Einstein-<br>Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment seems to illustrate. Even<br>though they are space-like separated, the state of the particle<br>in area B depends upon what the observer in area A decides<br>to observe (which way he orients his magnetic field).<br>
In other words, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect indicates<br>
that information can be communicated at<i> superluminal</i> (faster<br>than light) speeds contrary to the accepted ideas of physicists.<br>If the two particles in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought<br>experiment somehow are connected by a signal, that signal is<br>traveling faster than the speed of light. Einstein, Podolsky,<br>and Rosen may have created the first scientific example of a<br>superluminal connection.<br>
Einstein himself denied this conclusion. It is not possible,<br>
he argued, that the setting we choose for a measuring device<br>here can affect what happens somewhere else. In his autobi-<br>ography, written eleven years after the Einstein-Podolsky-<br>Rosen paper, he wrote:<br>
. . . on one supposition we should, in my opinion, abso-<br>
lutely hold fast; the real factual situation of the system<br>[the particle in area B] is independent of what is done with<br>the system Si [the particle in area A], which is spatially<br>separated from the former.4<br>
This opinion is, in effect, the principle of local causes. The<br>
principle of local causes says that what happens in one area<br>does not depend upon variables subject to the control of an<br>experimenter in a distant space-like separated area. The<br>principle of local causes is common sense. The results of an<br>experiment in a place distant and space-like separated from us<br>should not depend on what we decide to do or not to do right<br>here. (Except for the mother who rose in alarm at the same<br>
instant that her daughter's distant automobile crashed into a<br>tree—and similar cases—the macroscopic world appears to be<br>made of local phenomena.)<br>
Since phenomena are local in nature, argued Einstein,<br>
quantum theory has a serious flaw. According to quantum<br>theory, changing the measuring device in area A changes the<br>wave function which describes the particle in area B, but<br>
(according to Einstein) it cannot change &quot;the real factual situa-<br>

Therefore, one and the same &quot;factual situation&quot; in area B<br>

two different types of wave functions could he coordinated<br>with the identical factual situation of 82- '<br>
Here is another way of<br>
 at the same situation. Since<br>
the real factual situation in area B is independent of what is<br>done in area A, there must exist<i> simultaneously</i> in area B a<br>definite spin<i> up</i> or<i> clown</i> and a definite spin<i> right</i> or<i> left</i> to<br>account for all the results that we can get by orienting the<br>

and, therefore, it is an incomplete theory.*<br>
However, Einstein closed his argument with an incredible<br>
aside.<br>
One can escape from this conclusion [that quantum theory<br>is incomplete] only by either assuming that the measure-<br>ment of<br>

 or by denying independent real situations as such to<br>
things which are spatially separated from each other. Both<br>alternatives appear to me entirely<br>

that at a deep and fundamental level there is no such thing as<br>&quot;independent real situations&quot; of things which have interacted<br>in the past but which are spatially separated from each other,<br>or that changing the measuring device in area A<i> does</i> change<br>&quot;the real factual situation&quot; in area B.<br>
This brings us to Bell's theorem.<br>
Bell's theorem is a mathematical proof. What it &quot;proves&quot; is<br>
that if the statistical predictions of quantum theory are cor-<br>rect, then some of our commonsense ideas about the world<br>are profoundly mistaken.<br>
Bell's theorem does not demonstrate clearly in what way<br>
our commonsense ideas about the world are inadequate. There<br>are several possibilities. Each possibility has champions among<br>the small number of physicists who are familiar with Bell's<br>theorem. No matter which of the implications of Bell's theo-<br>rem we favor, however, Bell's theorem itself leads to the<br>inescapable conclusion that if the statistical predictions of<br>quantum theory are correct, then our commonsense ideas<br>about the world are profoundly deficient.<br>
This is quite a conclusion because<i> the statistical predictions</i><br>
<i>of quantum mechanics are always correct.</i> Quantum mechan-<br>ics is<i> the</i> theory. It has explained everything from subatomic<br>particles to transistors to stellar energy. It never has failed. It<br>has no competition.<br>
Quantum physicists realized in the 1920s that our common-<br>
sense ideas were inadequate for describing subatomic phe-<br>nomena (pages 20, 260). Bell's theorem shows that common-<br>sense ideas are inadequate even to describe macroscopic events,<br>events of the everyday world!<br>
As Henry Stapp wrote:<br>
The important thing about Bell's theorem is that it puts<br>
the dilemma posed by quantum phenomena clearly into<br>the realm of macroscopic phenomena . . . [it] shows that<br>our ordinary ideas about the world are somehow pro-<br>
foundly deficient even on the macroscopic level.'<br>
Bells theorem has been reformulated in several ways since<br>
Bell published the original version in 1964. No matter how it<br>is formulated, it projects the &quot;irrational&quot; aspects of subatomic<br>phenomena squarely into the macroscopis domain. It says<br>that not only do events in the realm of the very small behave<br>

in ways which are utterly different from our commonsense<br>view of the world, but also that events in the world at large,<br>the world of freeways and sports cars, behave in ways which<br>are utterly different from our commonsense view of them.<br>This incredible statement cannot be dismissed as fantasy be-<br>cause it is based upon the awesome and proven accuracy of<br>the quantum theory itself.<br>
Bell's theorem is based upon correlations between paired<br>
particles similar to the pair of hypothetical particles in the<br>
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment.* For example,<br>imagine a gas that emits light when it is electrically excited<br>(think of a neon sign). The excited atoms in the gas emit photons<br>in pairs. The photons in each pair fly off in opposite direc-<br>tions. Except for the difference in their direction of travel, the<br>
photons in each pair are identical twins. If one of them is<br>polarized vertically, the other one also is polarized vertically.<br>
If one of the photons in the pair is polarized horizontally, the<br>
other photon also is polarized horizontally. No matter what<br>the angle of polarization, both photons in every pair are<br>polarized in the same plane.<br>
Therefore, if we know the state of polarization of one of the<br>
particles, we automatically know the state of polarization of the<br>other particle. This situation is similar to the situation in the<br>
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment, except that now<br>
we are discussing states of polarization instead of spin states.<br>
We can verify that both photons in each pair of photons are<br>
polarized in the same plane by actually sending them through<br>polarizers. Below is a picture of this (conceptually) simple<br>procedure.<br>

A light source in the center of the picture emits a pair of<br>
photons. On each side of the light source a polarizer is placed<br>in the path of the emitted photon. Behind the polarizers are<br>photomultiplicr tubes which emit a click (or an inaudible<br>electronic equivalent) whenever they detect a photon<br>
Whenever the photomultipher tube in area A emits a click,<br>
the photomultiplier tube in area B also emits a click. This is<br>because both of the photons in each photon pair always are<br>polarized in the same plane, and both of the polarizers in this<br>arrangement are aligned in the same direction (in this case,<br>vertically). There is no theory involved here, just a matter<br>of counting clicks We know, and can verify, that when the<br>polarizers both are aligned in the same direction, the photo-<br>multiplier tubes behind them will click an equal number of<br>times. The clicks in area A are correlated with the clicks in<br>area B. The correlation, in this case, is<i> one.</i> Whenever one of<br>
the photomultiplier tube clicks, the other photomultiplier<br>tube always clicks as well.<br>
Now suppose that we orient one of the polarizers at 90<br>
degrees to the other. Below is a picture of this arrangement.<br>

One of the polarizers still is aligned vertically, but the other<br>polarizer now is aligned horizontally. Light waves that pass<br>through a vertical polarizer are stopped by a horizontal polarizer<br>and the other way round. Therefore, when the polarizers are<br>oriented at right angles to each other, a click in area A<i> never</i><br>
will be accompanied by a click in area B. The clicks in area A,<br>again, are correlated with the clicks in area B This time,<br>however, the correlation is<i> zero.</i> Whenever one of the<br>photomultiplier tubes clicks, the other photomultiplier tube<br>
<i>never</i> clicks.<br>
There also are correlations between the clicks in area A and<br>

the clicks in area B for every other possible combination of<br>polarizer settings between these two extremes. These statistical<br>
correlations can be predicted by the quantum theory. For a<br>given setting of the polarizers, a certain number of clicks in<br>one area will be accompanied by a certain number of clicks in<br>
the other area.<br>
Bell discovered that no matter what the settings of the<br>
polarizers, the clicks in area A are correlated too strongly to<br>the number of clicks in area B to be explained by chance.<br>
They have to be connected somehow. However, if they are<br>connected, then the principle of local causes (which says that<br>what happens in one area does not depend upon variables<br>
subject to the control of an experimenter in a distant space-<br>like area) is an illusion' In short, Bell's theorem shows that the<br>principle of local causes, however reasonable it sounds, is<br>mathematically incompatible with the assumption that the<br>statistical predictions of quantum theory are valid (at least<br>valid in this experiment and in the Emstein-Podolsky-Rosen<br>experiment).*<br>
The correlations which Bell used were calculated, but un-<br>
tested predictions of the quantum theory. In 1964, this experi-<br>ment was still a hypothetical construct In 1972, John Clauser<br>
*The Emstem-Podolsk\-Rosen argument for the incompleteness of quantum<br>theon was based upon the assumption of local causes This assumption seemed<br>
plausible to most physicists because most physicists doubted that the real factual<br>situation in one area of the EPR experiment actualK was being influenced bv<br>the actions of a faraway obsener Their doubts arose from the fact that the<br>quantum state composed of equal parts<i> up</i> and<i> cloun</i> is exactK equivalent to the<br>quantum state composed of equal parts<br>
 and<i> left</i> These two combinations<br>
are experimentally indistinguishable Thus the actions of the far-awav observer,<br>bv<br>
 can have no observable effects here Hence it is not clear that<br>
the real factual situation here is being changed<br>
The Emstein-Podolskv-Rosen argument (and the principle of local causes)<br>
was demolished bv Bell in 1964 Bell showed that several assumptions that are<br>
mphcit in the<br>
 argument implv that what happens<br>
xpenmentallv in area B<i> must depend</i> on what the experimenter does m area A,<br>r vice versa The sufficient assumptions are (1) that the observer in each area<br>
orient the magnetic field in his area in either of the two alternative direc-<br>
 (2) that some particular (although<br>
 unknown) experimental result<br>
an be assumed to occur in each of the four alternative experimental situations,<br>
and (3) that the statistical predictions of quantum theory are valid (sav to within<br>3%) in each of the four alternative cases Bell's argument demonstrates b\<br>simple arithmetic that these three assumptions imply that the experimental<br>results m one of the two areas must depend on what the observer in the other<br>area chooses to observe (i e , on how he orients the magnetic field of his<br>Stern-Gerlach device) This conclusion contradicts the locality assumption of<br>the Emstein-Podolskv-Rosen<br>

In 1975, Henry Stapp, in a work supported bv the U S<br>
Energy Research and Development Administration, wrote<br>
Bell's theorem is the most profound discovery of science 9<br>
The deduction of superlummal communication from the<br>
results of the Clauser-Freedman experiment rests upon an<br>important assumption nameh, that the states of the measur-<br>ing devices prior to the arrival of the photons in area A and<br>area B do not matter This is, after all, a reasonable assumption<br>Normally we say that the orientation of a measuring device<br>prior to a measurement is not relevant to the result that we<br>get at the time of a measurement The result of an experiment<br>depends upon the state of the measuring device at the time<br>that the particle is detected by it, and not on the state of the<br>measuring device before the particle gets there However,<br>superlummal communication cannot be deduced from the<br>results of the Clauser-Freedman experiment without this<br>assumption Even though the photons in the photon pair<br>
cannot exchange information via light signals while thev are in<br>flight (each is traveling away from the other at the speed of<br>light), the measuring device in area A and the measuring<br>device in area B, which are set prior to the beginning of the<br>experiment, mav have exchanged information in the conven-<br>

Like the Clauser-Freedman experiment (and several Clauser-<br>
Freedman-tvpe experiments which had been performed in<br>the meanwhile),11 Aspect's experiment verified the statistical<br>
predictions of quantum mechanics Because Aspect's exper-<br>iment, however, satisfied the conditions upon which the logi-<br>cal<br>
 leading to the phenomenon of superlummal trans-<br>
fer of information is based (that area A and area B are space-like<br>separated) physicists were able to deduce this phenomenon<br>solely on the basis of Aspect's experimental results This lent<br>considerable credence to the conclusion which Stapp had<br>reached five years previously Wrote Stapp<br>
Quantum phenomena provide<i> prima facie</i> evidence that<br>information gets around in ways that do not conform to<br>classical ideas Thus, the idea that information is transfer-<br>red superlummallv is,<i> a priori,</i> not unreasonable<br>
Everything we know about Nature is in accord with<br>
the idea that the fundamental process of Nature lies<br>outside space-time but generates events that can be<br>located in space-time The theorem of this paper sup-<br>ports this view of Nature by showing that superlummal<br>transfer of information is necessary, barring certain alter-<br>natives that seem less reasonable Indeed, the rea-<br>sonable philosophical position of Bohr seems to lead to<br>the rejection of the other possibilities, and hence, by<br>inference, to the conclusion that superlummal transfer of<br>information is necessary 12<br>

information between space-like separated events may be an<br>integral aspect of our physical reality.<br>
Bell's theorem showed that either the statistical predictions<br>
of quantum theory or the principle of local causes is false. It<br>did not say which one is false, but only that both of them<br>cannot be true. When Clauser and Freedman confirmed that<br>the statistical predictions of quantum theory are correct, the<br>startling conclusion was inescapable: The principle of local<br>causes must be false! However, if the principle of local causes<br>fails and, hence, the world is not the way it appears to be,<br>then what is the true nature of our world?<br>
There are several mutually exclusive possibilities. The first<br>
possibility, which we have just discussed, is that, appearances<br>to the contrary, there really may be no such thing as &quot;separate<br>parts&quot; in our world (in the dialect of physics, &quot;locality fails&quot;).<br>In that case, the idea that events are autonomous happenings<br>is an illusion. This would be the case for any &quot;separate parts&quot;<br>that have interacted with each other at any time in the past.<br>When &quot;separate parts&quot; interact with each other, they (their<br>wave functions) become correlated (through the exchange of<br>conventional signals) (forces). Unless this correlation is disrupted<br>by other external forces, the wave functions representing these<br>&quot;separate parts&quot; remain correlated forever, t For such corre-<br>lated &quot;separate parts,&quot; what an experimenter does in this area<br>has an intrinsic effect upon the results of an experiment in a<br>distant, space-like separated area. This possibility entails a<br>faster-than-light communication of a type different than con-<br>ventional physics can explain.<br>

diately connected to what happens elsewhere in the universe,<br>which, in turn, is intimately and immediately connected to<br>

what happens elsewhere in the universe, and so on, simply<br>because the &quot;separate parts&quot; of the universe are not separate<br>parts.<br>
&quot;Parts,&quot; wrote David Bohnv<br>
are seen to be in immediate connection, in which their<br>dynamical relationships depend, in an irreducible way,<br>on the state of the whole system (and, indeed, on that of<br>broader systems in which they are contained, extending<br>ultimately and in principle to the entire universe) Thus,<br>one is led to a new notion of<i> unbroken wholeness</i> which<br>denies the classical idea of analyzability of the world into<br>separately and independently existent parts . . .'3<br>
According to quantum mechanics, individual events are de-<br>
termined by pure chance (page 68). We can calculate, for<br>example, that a certain percentage of spontaneous positive<br>kaon decays will produce an antimuon and a neutrino (63%), a<br>certain percentage will produce a positive pion and a neutral<br>pion (21%), a certain percentage will produce two positive<br>pions and a negative pion (5 5%), a certain percentage will<br>produce a positron, a neutrino, and a neutral pion (4.8%), a<br>certain percentage will produce an antimuon, a neutrino, and<br>a neutral pion (3.4%), and so on. However, quantum theory<br>cannot predict<i> which</i> decay will produce which result. Indi-<br>vidual events, according to quantum mechanics, are completely<br>
random.<br>
Said another way, the wave function which describes<br>
spontaneous kaon decays contains all of these possible results<br>When the decay actually happens, one of these potentialities<br>is converted into an actuality. Even though the probability of<br>each potentiality can be calculated, which potentiality actually<br>happens at the moment of decay is a matter of chance.<br>
Bells theorem implies that which decay reaction occurs at a<br>
certain time is<i> not a.</i> matter of chance. Like everything else, it<br>is dependent upon something which is happening elsewhere.*<br>

In the words of Stapp.<br>
. . . the conversion of potentialities into actualities cannot<br>
proceed on the basis of locally available information. If<br>one accepts the usual ideas about how information propa-<br>gates through space and time, then Bell's theorem shows<br>that the macroscopic responses cannot be independent of<br>far-awav causes This problem is neither resolved nor<br>alleviated bv saying that the response is determined<br>by &quot;pure chance.&quot; Bell's theorem proves precisely that<br>the determination of the macroscopic response must<br>be &quot;nonchance, ' at least to the extent of allowing some<br>sort of dependence of this response upon the far-away<br>
Superluminal quantum connectedness seems to be, on the<br>
surface at least, a possible explanation for some types of<br>psychic phenomena. Telepathy, for example, often appears to<br>happen instantaneously, if not faster. Psychic phenomena<br>have been held in disdain by physicists since the days of<br>
Newton. In fact, most physicists do not even believe that<br>
they exist, t<br>
In this sense, Bell's theorem could be the Trojan horse in<br>
the physicists' camp, first, because it proves that quantum<br>theory requires connections that appear to resemble telepathic<br>communication, and second, because it provides the mathe-<br>matical framework through which serious physicists (all physi-<br>cists are serious) could find themselves discussing types of<br>phenomena which, ironically, they do not believe exist.<br>

separated area—is based upon two tacit assumptions which<br>are so obvious that they are easy to overlook.<br>
First, the principle of local causes assumes that we have a<br>
choice about how we perform our experiments. Imagine that<br>we are doing Clauser and Freedman's photon experiment.<br>We have before us a switch which determines how the<br>polarizes will be positioned. If we throw the switch up, the<br>polarizers are aligned with each other. If we throw the switch<br>down, the polarizers are oriented at right angles with each<br>other. Suppose that we decide to throw the switch up and<br>align the polarizers. Normally, we assume that we<i> could<br></i>thrown the switch down and oriented the polarizers at right<br>angles if we had wanted to. In other words, we assume that<br>we are free to decide whether the switch before us will be up<br>or down when the experiment begins.<br>
The principle of local causes assumes (&quot;. . . variables subject<br>
to the control of an experimenter . . .&quot;) that we possess and<br>can exercise a free will in the determination of how to per-<br>form our experiment. Second, and this is even easier to over-<br>look, the principle of local causes assumes that if we had<br>performed our experiment in a different way than we actuallv<br>did perform it, we would have obtained some definite re-<br>sults. These two assumptions—that we can choose how to<br>perform our experiment and that each of our choices, includ-<br>ing those that we did not select, produces or would have<br>produced definite results—is what Stapp calls &quot;contrafactual<br>definiteness.&quot;<br>
The fact, in this case, is that we decided to perform our<br>
experiment with the switch in the &quot;up&quot; position. We assume<br>that, contrary to this fact (contrafactually), we<i> could have<br></i>performed it with the switch in the &quot;down&quot; position. By<br>performing the experiment with the switch in the &quot;up&quot; position,<br>we obtained some definite results (a certain number of clicks<br>in each area). Therefore, we assume that if we had chosen to<br>perform the experiment with the switch in the &quot;down&quot; position,<br>
<hr>
<A name=314></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-314_1.png"><br>
300 / ENLIGHTENMENT<br>
we likewise would have obtained some definite results. (It is<br>not necessary that we be able to calculate what these other<br>results are). Odd as it may seem, some physical theories, as<br>we shall see, do not assume that &quot;what would have happened<br>if . . .&quot; produces definite results.<br>
Since Bell's theorem shows that, assuming the validity of<br>
quantum theory, the principle of local causes is incorrect,<br>and, if we do not want to accept the existence of superluminal<br>connections (&quot;the failure of locality&quot;) as the reason for the<br>failure of the principle of local causes, then we are forced to<br>confront the possibility that our assumptions about contrafactual<br>definiteness are incorrect (&quot;contrafactual definiteness fails&quot;).<br>Since contrafactual definiteness has two parts, there are two<br>ways in which contrafactual definiteness could fail.<br>
The first possibility is that free will is an illusion (&quot;contra-<br>
factualness fails&quot;). Perhaps there is no such thing as &quot;what<br>would have happened  i f . . .&quot; Perhaps there can be only what<br>is. In this case, we are led to a<i> superdeterminism.</i> This is a<br>determinism far beyond ordinary determinism. Ordinary<br>determinism states that once the initial situation of a system is<br>established, the future of the system also is established since<br>it must develop according to inexorable laws of cause and<br>effect. This type of determinism was the basis of the Great<br>
Machine view of the universe (page 23). According to this<br>
view, however, if the initial situation of a system, like the<br>universe, is changed, then the future of the system also is<br>changed.<br>
According to superdeterminism,<i> not even the initial situation</i><br>
<i>of the universe could be changed.</i> Not only is it impossible for<br>things to be other than they are, it is even impossible that the<br>initial situation of the universe could have been other than<br>what it was. No matter what we are doing at any given mo-<br>ment, it is the only thing that<i> ever</i> was possible for us to be<br>doing at that moment.<br>
Contrafactual definiteness also fails if the &quot;definiteness&quot;<br>
assumption in it fails. In this case, we do have a choice in the<br>way that we perform our experiments, but &quot;what would have<br>happened if  . . . &quot; does not produce any definite results.<br>This alternative is just as strange as it sounds. It is also<br>
just what comes out of the Many Worlds Interpretation of<br>

Quantum Mechanics (page 83). According to the Many Worlds<br>theory, whenever a choice is made in the universe between<br>one possible event and another, the universe splits into dif-<br>ferent branches.<br>
In our hypothetical experiment we decided to throw the<br>
switch into the &quot;up&quot; position. When the experiment was<br>performed with the switch in the &quot;up&quot; position, it gave us<i> a<br></i>definite result (a certain number of clicks in each area). How-<br>ever, according to the Many Worlds theory, at the moment<br>that we threw the switch up, the universe split into two<br>branches. In one branch, the experiment was performed with<br>the switch in the &quot;up&quot; position. In the other branch, the<br>experiment was performed with the switch in the &quot;down&quot;<br>position.<br>
Who performed the experiment in the second branch? There<br>
is a different edition of us in each of the different branches of<br>the universe! Each edition of us is convinced that<i> our</i> branch<br>of the universe is the entirety of reality.<br>
The experiment in the second branch, the experiment which<br>
was performed with the switch in the &quot;down&quot; position, also<br>produced a definite result (a certain number of clicks in each<br>area). However, that result is in another branch of the universe,<br>not in ours. Therefore, as far as we in this branch of the<br>universe are concerned, &quot;what would have happened if . . .&quot;<br>actually<i> did</i> happen, and actually did produce definite results,<br>but in a branch of the universe which is forever beyond our<br>experiential reality.*<br>
*A<br>
 also occurs at the choice between results. This can be illustrated<br>
by the EPR experiment. On the<br>
 branch where, for example, the axis of<br>
the magnetic field is \ertical and the result is either spin<i> up</i> or spin<br>
 there<br>
is a branching into two &quot;twigs.&quot; In the first twig the result is spin<i> up,</i> and in the<br>second twig the result is spin<br>
 Similarly, on the second branch, where the<br>
axis of the magnetic field is horizontal, there is also a branching into two twigs.<br>On the first of these<br>
 the result is spin rigftf, and on the second of these<br>
twigs, the result is spin<i> left.</i> Thus, on any given twig of any branch there is a<br>definite result (spin<i> up, down,</i> rig/if, or<i> left},</i> but the idea of &quot;what would have<br>happened if one had chosen the 'other branch' &quot; makes no sense, for both<br>results<i> (up</i> or<i> down,</i> or<br>
 or<i> left)</i> occur on different branches. Thus the<br>
results on &quot;the other&quot; branch are not definite.<br>

Below is a diagram of the logical implications of Bell's<br>
theorem. It is drawn from informal discussions of the Funda-<br>mental Physics Group at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,<br>under the direction and sponsorship of Dr. Elizabeth Rauscher.<br>
These discussions, in turn, were based primarily upon the<br>work of Henry Stapp.<br>
<b>SUFERMTERMMSM MANY</b><br>
To summarize, Bell's theorem showed, in 1964, that either<br>
the statistical predictions of (juantum theory are false or the<br>principle of local causes is false. In 1972, Clauser and Freed-<br>man performed an experiment at Berkeley which validated<br>the relevant statistical predictions of quantum theory. Therefore,<br>according to Bell's theorem, the principle of locals causes<br><i>must</i> be false.<br>
The principle of local causes says that what happens in<br>
one area does not depend upon variables subject to the<br>control of an experimenter in a distant space-like separated<br>area. The simplest way to explain the failure of the principle<br>of local causes is to conclude that what happens is one<br>area<i> does</i> depend upon variables subject to the control of<br>an experimenter in a distant space-like separated area. If<br>this explanation is correct, then we live in a nonlocal<br>universe (&quot;locality fails&quot;) characterized by superluminal<br>(faster than light) connections between apparently &quot;separate<br>parts.&quot;<br>
However, there are other ways in which the principle of<br>
local causes can fail. The principle of local causes is based<br>upon two tacit assumptions. The first tacit assumption is thct<br>we have the ability to determine our own actions, i.e.,<br>

THE END OF SCIENCE / 303<br>
we have a free will.* The second tacit assumption is that<br>when we choose to do one thing in place of another, &quot;what<br>would have happened if . . .&quot; would have produced definite<br>results. These two assumptions together are what Stapp calls<br>
 definiteness.<br>
If the first assumption (contrafactualness) fails, then we are<br>
led to a superdeterminism which precludes the idea of alter-<br>native possibilities. According to this type of determinism, it is<br>not possible that the world<i> ever</i> could have been other than it<br>is.<br>
If the second assumption (definiteness) fails, then we<br>
are led to the Many Worlds theory in which the world<br>continuously is splitting into separate and mutually inacces-<br>sible branches, each of which contains different editions of<br>the same actors performing different acts at the same time<br>on different stages which somehow are located in the same<br>place.<br>
There may be still ways to understand the failure of<br>
the principle of local causes, but the very fact that it must fail<br>means that the world is in some way profoundly different<br>from our ordinary ideas about it. (Perhaps we really are living<br>in a dark cave).<br>
The &quot;no models&quot; option on the diagram is, in effect, the<br>
Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (page 37).<br>In 1927, the most famous assemblage of physicists in history<br>decided that it might not ever be possible to construct a<br>model of reality, i.e., to explain the way things &quot;really are<br>behind the scenes.&quot; Despite the tidal wave of &quot;knowledge&quot;<br>which has swept over us for forty years, the Fundamental<br>Physics Group found it necessary, like the physicists at<br>Copenhagen a half century before them, to acknowledge that<br>it might not be possible to construct a model of reality. This<br>acknowledgment is more than a recognition of the limitations<br>of this theory or that theory. It is a recognition emerging<br>throughout the West that<i> knowledge itself</i> is limited. Said<br>
* Physicists usually express philosophical phrases (like &quot;free will&quot;) in more precise<br>terms. For example, the concept of free will is defined within this experimental<br>situation as the tacit assumption that &quot;each of the two observers, one located in<br>
area A, and the other located in area B. can choose between two possible<br>
 [experiments].&quot; These two choices are considered &quot;free variables&quot; in<br>
the context of the study of the observations made on the two-particle system.<br>

another way, it is<i> a</i> recognition of the difference between<br>knowledge and wisdom.*<br>
Classical science starts with the assumption of separate<br>
parts which together constitute physical reality. Since its<br>inception, it has concerned itself with how these separate parts<br>are related.<br>
Newton's great work showed that the earth, the moon and<br>
the planets are governed by the same laws as falling apples.<br>The French mathematician, Descartes, invented a way of<br>drawing pictures of relationships between different measure-<br>ments of time and distance. This process (analytic geometry)<br>is a wonderful tool for organizing a wealth of scattered data<br>into one meaningful pattern. Herein lies the strength of western<br>science. It brings huge tracts of apparently unrelated experience<br>into a rational framework of simple concepts like the laws of<br>motion. The starting point of this process is a mental attitude<br>which initially perceives the physical world as fragmented and<br>different experiences as logically unrelated. Newtonian science<br>is the effort to find the relationships between pre-existing<br>&quot;separate parts.&quot;<br>
Quantum mechanics is based upon the opposite epistemo-<br>
logical assumption. Thus, there are profound<br>
 be-<br>
tween Newtonian mechanics and quantum theory.<br>
The most fundamental difference between Newtonian phys-<br>
ics and quantum mechanics is the fact that quantum mechan-<br>ics is based upon<i> observations</i> (&quot;measurements&quot;). Without a<br>measurement of some kind, quantum mechanics is mute.<br>Quantum mechanics says nothing about what happens between<br>measurements. In Heisenberg's words: &quot;The term 'happens'<br>
*In fact, most physicists do<i> not</i> believe that it is worthwhile to think about these<br>problems. The main thrust of the Copenhagen Interpretation, which is the<br>interpretation of quantum theory accepted by the bulk of the scientific commu-<br>nity, is that the proper goal of science is to provide a mathematical framework<br>
for organizing and expanding our experiences, rather than providing a picture<br>of some reality that could lie behind these experiences. That is, most physicists<br>today side with Bohr, rather than with Einstein, on the question of the utility of<br>seeking a model of a reality that can be conceived of independently of our<br>experience of it. From the Copenhagen point of view, quantum theory is<br>satisfactory as it is, and the effort to &quot;understand&quot; it more deeply is not productive<br>for science. Such efforts lead to perplexities of just the sort that we have been<br>discussing. These perplexities<br>
 to most physicists to be more philosophical<br>
than physical. Thus most physicists choose the &quot;no model&quot; option shown in the<br>
diagram.<br>
<hr>
<A name=319></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-319_1.png"><br>
THE END OF SCIENCE / 305<br>
is restricted to the observation.&quot;lc&gt; This is very important, for<br>it constitutes a philosophy of science unlike any before it.<br>
We commonly say, for example, that we detect an electron<br>
at point A and then at point B, but strictly speaking, this is<br>incorrect. According to quantum mechanics, there was no<br>electron which traveled from point A to point B. There are<br>only the measurements that we made at point A and at point<br>B.<br>
Quantum theory not only is closely bound to philosophy,<br>
but also—and this is becoming increasingly apparent—to<br>theories of perception. As early as 1932, von Neumann explored<br>this relation in his &quot;Theory of Measurement.&quot; (Exactly when<br>does the wave function associated with a particle collapse?<br>When the particle strikes a photographic plate? When the<br>photographic plate is developed? When the light rays from<br>the developed photographic plate strike our retina? When the<br>nerve impulses from the retina reach our brain?) (page 77).<br>
Bohr's principle of complementarity (page 93) also addresses<br>
the underlying relation of physics to consciousness. The<br>experimenter's choice of experiment determines which mutu-<br>ally exclusive aspect of the same phenomenon (wave or parti-<br>
cle) will manifest itself. Likewise, Heisenberg's uncertainty<br>principle (page 111) demonstrates that we cannot observe a<br>phenomenon without changing it. The physical properties which<br>we observe in the &quot;external&quot; world are enmeshed in our own<br>perceptions not only psychologically, but ontologically as well.<br>
The second most fundamental difference between Newtonian<br>
physics and quantum theory is that Newtonian physics predicts<br>events and quantum mechanics predicts the probability of<br>events. According to quantum mechanics, the only determinable<br>relation between events is statistical—that is, a matter of<br>probability.<br>
David Bohm, Professor of Physics at Birkbeck College,<br>
University of London, proposes that quantum physics is, in<br>
fact, based upon a perception of a new order. According to<br>
Bohm, &quot;We must turn physics around. Instead of starting with<br>
parts and showing how they work together (the Cartesian<br>order) (page 22) we start with the whole.&quot;lfi<br>
Bohm's theory is compatible with Bell's theorem. Bell's<br>
theorem implies that the apparently &quot;separate parts&quot; of the<br>universe could be intimately connected at a deep and funda-<br>mental level. Bohm asserts that the most fundamental level is<br>
<hr>
<A name=320></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-320_1.png"><br>
306 / ENLIGHTENMENT<br>
an<i> unbroken wholeness</i> which is, in his words, &quot;that-which-<br>is.&quot; All things, including space, time and matter are forms of<br>that-which-is. There is an order which is enfolded into the<br>very process of the universe, but that enfolded order may not<br>be readily apparent.<br>
For example, imagine a large hollow cylinder into which is<br>
placed a smaller cylinder. The space between the smaller<br>cylinder and the larger cylinder is filled with a clear viscous<br>
liquid like glycerine (such a device actually exists).<br>
Now suppose that we deposit a small droplet of ink on the<br>
surface of the glycerine. Because of the nature of the glycer-<br>ine, the ink drop remains intact, a well-defined black spot<br>floating on a clear liquid.<br>
If we begin to rotate one of the cylinders, say in a clockwise<br>
direction, the drop of ink spreads out in the opposite direc-<br>tion, making a line which grows thinner and thinner until it<br>disappears altogether. The ink droplet now is enfolded com-<br>pletely into the glycerine,<i> but it is still there.</i> When we rotate<br>the cylinder in the opposite direction, the ink droplet reappears.<br>A fine line appears which grows thicker and thicker and then<br>collects into a single point.<br>
If we continue the counterclockwise motion of the cylinder,<br>
the same thing happens, but in reverse. We can repeat this<br>process as often as we like. Each time the ink spot becomes a<br>

fine line and disappears into the glycerine only to reappear<br>again when the motion of the glycerine is reversed.<br>
If it requires one complete revolution of the cylinder clock-<br>
wise to make the droplet disappear completely, one complete<br>revolution of the cylinder counterclockwise will make it reappear<br>in its original shape and location. The number of revolutions<br>required to make the droplet disappear or reappear is the<br>enfolded order. Bohm calls this enfolded order the &quot;implicate<br>order,&quot; which means the same thing.<br>
Suppose that we deposit a drop of ink on the surface of the<br>
glycerine, revolve the cylinder clockwise until the drop<br>disappears (one revolution), add a second drop of ink to the<br>glycerine, continue to revolve the cylinder in the same direc-<br>tion until<i> it</i> disappears (one more revolution), and then add a<br>third drop of ink to the glycerine and revolve the cylinder one<br>more revolution until the third drop also disappears. Now we<br>have three ink drops enfolded into the glycerine. None of<br>them are visible, but we know where each of them is in the<br>implicate order.<br>
When we revolve the cylinder in the opposite direction,<br>
one drop of ink (the third) appears after one revolution, an-<br>other drop of ink (the second) appears after the next revolution,<br>and another drop of ink (the first) appears after the third<br>revolution. This is the unfolded, or &quot;explicate,&quot; order. The<br>three ink droplets appear to be unrelated in the explicate<br>(unfolded) order, but we know that they<i> are</i> related in the<br>implicate (enfolded) order.<br>
If<br>
 consider the condensation of ink droplets in this<br>
experiment as &quot;particles,&quot; we have Bohm's hypothesis of<br>apparently random subatomic phenomena. &quot;Particles' may<br>appear in different places yet be connected in the implicate<br>order. In Bohm's words, &quot;Particles may be discontiguous in<br>space (the explicate order) but continguous in the implicate<br>order.&quot;17<br>
&quot;Matter is a form of the implicate order as a vortex is a form<br>
of the water—it is not reducible to smaller particles.&quot;18 Like<br>&quot;matter&quot; and everything else, particles are forms of the impli-<br>cate order. If this is difficult to grasp, it is because our minds<br>demand to know, &quot;What is the 'implicate order' the implicate<br>order of?&quot;<br>
The &quot;implicate order&quot; is the implicate order of that-which-is.<br>
However, that-which-is is the implicate order. This world view<br>

is so<br>
 from the one that we are using that, as Bohm<br>
points out, &quot;Description is totally incompatible with what we<br>want to say.&quot;19 Description is incompatible with what we want<br>to say because our thinking is based upon an ancient Greek<br>mode of thought. According to this mode of thought, only<br>
Being is. Therefore, Non-being<i> is not.</i> This way of thinking<br>gives us a practical tool for dealing with the world, but it<br>
doesn't describe what happens. Actually, Non-being also is.<br>
Both Being and Non-being are that-which-is.<i> Everything,</i> even<br>&quot;emptiness,&quot; is that-which-is. There is nothing which is not<br>that-which-is.<br>
This way of looking at reality raises the question of the<br>
consciousness of the observer. Our minds demand to know,<br>&quot;What is the 'implicate order' the implicate order of?&quot; be-<br>cause our culture has taught us to perceive only the explicate<br>order (the Cartesian view). &quot;Things&quot; to us are intrinsically<br>
separate.<br>
Bohm's physics require, in his words, a new &quot;instrument of<br>
thought.&quot; A new instrument of thought such as is needed to<br>understand Bohm's physics, however, would radically alter<br>the consciousness of the observer, reorientating it toward a<br>perception of the &quot;unbroken wholeness&quot; of which everything<br>is a form.<br>
However, such a perception would not cause an inability to<br>
see the explicate order. Bohm's physics contains an element<br>of relativity parallel to that of Einstein's theories. The impli-<br>
cate or explicate nature of order (or order of nature) depends<br>upon the perspective of the viewer. The problem is that our<br>present viewpoint is limited to the perspective of the explicate<br>order. From the perspective of the implicate order the<br>
apparently &quot;separate elements&quot; of the explicate order are<br>intimately related. Even the phrases &quot;elements&quot; and &quot;inti-<br>mately related&quot; imply a Cartesian separateness which does not<br>exist. At the fundamental level of that-which-is, the &quot;separate<br>elements&quot; which are &quot;intimately related in the implicate order&quot;<br><i>are</i> the implicate order.<br>
The requirement for a new instrument of thought upon which<br>
to base Bohm's physics may not be as much of an obstacle as<br>it first appears. There already exists an instrument of thought<br>based upon an &quot;unbroken wholeness.&quot; Furthermore, there<br>exist a number of sophisticated psychologies, distilled from<br>two thousand years of practice and introspection, whose sole<br>purpose is to develop this thought instrument.<br>
<hr>
<A name=323></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-323_1.png"><br>
THE END OF SCIENCE / 309<br>
These psychologies are what we commonly call &quot;Eastern<br>
religions.&quot; &quot;Eastern religions&quot; differ considerably among<br>themselves. It would be a mistake to equate Hinduism, for<br>example, with Buddhism, even though they are more like<br>each other than either one of them is like a religion of the<br>West. Nonetheless, all eastern religions (psychologies) are com-<br>patible in a very fundamental way with Bohm's physics and<br>philosophy. All of them are based upon the experience of a<br>pure, undifferentiated reality which is that-which-is.<br>
While it would be naive to overstate the similarities be-<br>
tween Bohm's physics and eastern philosophies, it would be<br>foolish to ignore them. Consider, for example, the following<br>sentences:<br>
The word &quot;reality&quot; is derived from the roots &quot;thing&quot;<i> (res)<br></i>and &quot;think&quot;<i> (revi).</i> &quot;Reality&quot; means &quot;everything you can<br>think about.&quot; This is not &quot;that-which-is.&quot; No idea can cap-<br>ture &quot;truth&quot; in the sense of that-which-is.<br>
The ultimate perception does not originate in the brain<br>or any material structure, although a material structure is<br>
necessary to manifest it. The subtle mechanism of know-<br>ing the truth does not originate in the brain.<br>
There is a similarity between thought and matter. All<br>
matter, including ourselves, is determined by &quot;informa-<br>tion.&quot; &quot;Information&quot; is what determines space and time.<br>
Taken out of context, there is no absolute way of knowing<br>
whether these statements were made by Professor Bohm or a<br>Tibetan Buddhist. In fact, these sentences were excerpted<br>from different parts of two<i> physics</i> lectures that Professor Bohm<br>gave at Berkeley in April, 1977. The first lecture was given on<br>the campus to physics students. The second lecture was given<br>
in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory to a group of profes-<br>sional physicists. Two of these three statements were taken from<br>the<i> second</i> lecture, the one given to the advanced physicists.<br>
It is ironic that while Bohm's theories are received with<br>
some skepticism by most professional physicists, they would<br>
I find an immediately sympathetic reception among the thousands<br>

of people in our culture who have turned their backs on science<br>in their own quest for the ultimate nature of reality.<br>
If Bohm's physics, or one similar to it, should become the<br>
main thrust of physics in the future, the dances of East and<br>West could blend in exquisite harmony. Physics curricula of<br>the twenty-first century could include classes in meditation.<br>
The function of eastern<br>
 (psychologies) is to allow<br>
the mind to escape the confines of the symbolic. According to<br>this view,<br>
 is a symbol, not only words and con-<br>
cepts, but also people and things. Beyond the confines of the<br>symbolic lies that which is, pure awareness, the experience of<br>the &quot;suchness&quot; of reality.<br>
Nonetheless, every eastern religion resorts to the use of<br>
symbols to escape the realm of the symbolic. Some disciplines<br>use symbols more than others, but all of them use symbols in<br>one form or another. Therefore, the question arises, if pure<br>
awareness is considered distinct from the content of awareness,<br>in what ways specifically does the content of awareness affect<br>the realization of pure awareness? What types of content prompt<br>the mind to leap forward. What enables it to activate the<br>self-fulfilling capability to transcend itself.<br>
It is very difficult to answer this question. Any answer is<br>
only a point of view. A point of view itself is limiting. To<br>&quot;understand&quot; something is to give up some other way of con-<br>ceiving it. This is another way of saying that the mind deals in<br>forms of limitation. Nonetheless, there is a relationship be-<br>tween the content of awareness and the ability of the mind to<br>transcend itself.<br>
&quot;Reality&quot; is what we take to be true. What we take to be<br>
true is what we believe. What we believe is based upon our<br>perceptions. What we perceive depends upon what we look<br>for. What we look for depends upon what we think. What we<br>think depends upon what we perceive. What we perceive<br>determines what we believe. What we believe determines<br>what we take to be true. What we take to be true is our<br>reality.<br>
The central focus of this process, initially at any rate, is<br>
&quot;What we think.&quot; We at least can say that allegiance to a<br>symbol of openness (Christ, Buddha, Krishna, &quot;the infinite<br>diversity of nature,&quot; etc.) seems to open the mind and that an<br>
open mind is often the first step in the process of enlight-<br>enment.<br>

THE END OF SCIENCE / 31 1<br>
The psychological gestalt of physics has shifted radically in<br>
the last century to one of extreme openness. In the middle<br>
1800s, Newtonian mechanics was at its zenith. There seemed<br>
to be no phenomenon which could not be explained in terms<br>of mechanical models. All mechanical models were subject to<br>long-established principles. The chairman of the physics de-<br>partment at Harvard discouraged graduate study because so<br>few important matters remained unsolved.20<br>
In a speech to the Royal Institution in 1900, Lord Kelvin<br>
reflected that there were only two &quot;clouds&quot; on the horizon of<br>physics, the problem of black-body radiation and the Michel-<br>son-Morley experiment.21 There was no doubt, said Kelvin,<br>that they soon would be gone. He was wrong. Kelvin's two<br>&quot;clouds&quot; signaled the end of the era that began with Galileo<br>and Newton. The problem of black-body radiation led to<br>Planck's discovery of the quantum of action. Within thirty<br>years the entirety of Newtonian physics became a special<br>limiting case of the newly developing quantum theory. The<br>
Michelson-Morley experiment foreshadowed Einstein's famous<br>
theories of relativity. By 1927, the foundations of the new<br>physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, were in place.<br>
In contrast to Kelvin's time, the allegiance of physicists<br>
today is to a symbol of extreme openness. Isidor Rabi, Nobel<br>Prize winner and Chairman Emeritus of the Physics Depart-<br>ment at Columbia University, wrote in 1975:<br>
I don't think that physics will ever have an end. I think<br>that the novelty of nature is such that its variety will be<br>infinite—not just in changing forms but in the profundity<br>of insight and the newness of ideas . .<br>
Stapp wrote in 1971:<br>
. . . human inquiry can continue indefinitely to yield im-<br>
portant new truths.23<br>
The &quot;What we think&quot; of physicists today is that the physics of<br>
nature, like human experience itself, is infinitely diverse.<br>
Eastern religions have nothing to say about physics, but<br>
they have a great deal to say about human experience. In<br>Hindu mythology, Kali, the Divine Mother, is the symbol for<br>the infinite diversity of experience. Kali represents the entire<br>physical plane. She is the drama, tragedy, humor, and sorrow<br>of life. She is the brother, father, sister, mother, lover, and<br>
<hr>
<A name=326></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-326_1.png"><br>
312 / ENLIGHTENMENT<br>
friend. She is the fiend, monster, beast, and brute. She is the<br>sun and the ocean. She is the grass and the dew. She is our<br>sense of accomplishment and our sense of doing worthwhile.<br>Our thrill of discovery is a pendant on her bracelet. Our grati-<br>
fication is a spot of color on her cheek. Our sense of importance<br>
is the bell on her toe.<br>
This full and seductive, terrible and wonderful earth mother<br>
<i>always</i> has something to offer. Hindus know the impossibility<br>of seducing her or conquering her and the futility of loving<br>her or hating her; so they do the only thing that they can do.<br>They simply honor her.<br>
In a particular story, Kali, the Divine Mother, is Sita, the<br>
wife of God. Ram is God. Ram, Sita, and Laksaman, who is<br>Ram's brother, are walking along a jungle trail. The path is so<br>narrow that most of the time Laksaman can see only Sita, who<br>walks between him and Ram. Every so often, however, the<br>path turns in such a way that Laksaman can see his brother,<br>God.<br>
These powerful metaphors have application to the develop-<br>
ing drama of physics. Although most physicists have little<br>patience (professionally) with metaphors, physics itself has be-<br>come a powerful metaphor. Twentieth-century physics is the<br>story of a journey from intellectual entrenchment to intellec-<br>tual openness, despite the conservative prove-it-to-me nature<br>of individual physicists. The realization that the discoveries of<br>physics<i> never</i> will end has brought physicists, as well as those<br>
who have followed the story of physics, to an extremely fertile<br>plateau. This realization invites the intellect to leap forward,<br>although at great risk to its present hegemony.<br>
The Wu Li Masters know that physicists are doing more<br>
than &quot;discovering the endless diversity of nature.&quot; They are<br>dancing with Kali, the Divine Mother of Hindu mythology.<br>
Buddhism is both a philosophy and a practice. Buddhist<br>
philosophy is rich and profound. Buddhist practice is called<br><i>Tantra. Tantra</i> is the Sanskrit word meaning &quot;to weave.&quot;<br>
There is little that can be said about<i> Tantra.</i> It must be done.<br>
Buddhist philosophy reached its ultimate development in<br>
the second century A.D No one has been able to improve<br>much on it since then. The distinction between Buddhist phi-<br>losophy and<i> Tantra</i> is well defined. Buddhist philosophy can<br>be intellectualized.<i> Tantra</i> cannot. Buddhist philosophy is a<br>function of the rational mind.<i> Tantra</i> transcends rationality.<br>
<hr>
<A name=327></a><IMG src="dancingmasters-327_1.png"><br>
THE END OF SCIENCE / 313<br>
The most profound thinkers of the Indian civilization discovered<br>that words and concepts could take them only so far. Beyond<br>that point came the actual doing of a practice, the experience<br>of which was ineffable. This did not prevent them from<br>progressively refining the practice into an extremely effective<br>and sophisticated set of techniques, but it did prevent them<br>from being able to describe the experiences which these<br>techniques produce.<br>
The practice of<i> Tantra</i> does not mean the end of rational<br>
thought. It means the integration of thought based on symbols<br>into larger spectrums of awareness. (Enlightened people still<br>remember their zip codes.)<br>
The development of Buddhism in India shows that a profound<br>
and penetrating intellectual quest into the ultimate nature of<br>reality can culminate in, or at least set the stage for, a quantum<br>leap beyond rationality. In fact, on an individual level, this is<br>one of the roads to enlightenment. Tibetan Buddhism calls it<br>the Path without Form, or the Practice of Mind. The Path<br>without Form is prescribed for people of intellectual tempera-<br>ment. The science of physics is following a similar path.<br>
The development of physics in the twentieth century al-<br>
ready has transformed the consciousness of those involved<br>with it. The study of complementarity (page 93), the uncer-<br>tainty principle (page 111), quantum field theory (page 199),<br>and the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics<br>(page 37) produces insights into the nature of reality very<br>similar to those produced by the study of eastern philosophy.<br>
The profound physicists of this century increasingly have be-<br>
come aware that they are confronting the ineffable.<br>
Max Planck, the father of quantum mechanics, wrote:<br>
Science . . . means unresting endeavor and continually<br>progressing development toward an aim which the poetic<br>intuition may apprehend, but which the intellect can never<br>
fully grasp.24<br>
We are approaching the end of science. &quot;The end of science&quot;<br>
does not mean the end of the &quot;unresting endeavor and<br>continually progressing development&quot; of more and more com-<br>prehensive and useful physical theories. (Enlightened physi-<br>cists remember their zip codes, too.) The &quot;end of science&quot;<br>means the coming of western civilization, in its own time and<br>in its own way, into the higher dimensions of human exper-<br>ience.<br>

Professor G F Chew, Chairman of the Physics Depart-<br>
ment at Berkeley, remarked, in reference to a theory of parti-<br>
cle physics<br>
Our current<br>
 [with certain aspects of advanced<br>
phvsics] may thus be only a foretaste of a completely new<br>form of human intellectual endeavor, one that will not only<br>lie outside phvsics but will not even be<br>
 as<br>
' scientific<br>
We need not make a pilgrimage to India or Tibet There is<br>
much to learn there, but here at home, in the most incon-<br>
ceivable of places, amidst the particle accelerators and com-<br>puters, our own Path without Form is emerging<br>
Al Huang, the Tai Chi<br>
 who created the metaphor of<br>
VVu Li, once wrote sooner or later we reach a dead end<br>when we talk<br>
 He could as well have said that sooner or<br>
later we go round in circles when we talk since going round in<br>a circle is one kind of dead end<br>
 we sat in a cabin at Esalen and talked late into the night,<br>
mv new friend, David Finkelstem, spoke to us softly<br>
I think it would be misleading to call particles the entities<br>involved in the most primitive events of the theory<br>[quantum topology] because they don't move in space<br>and time, thev don t earn mass, they don't have charge,<br>they don t have energy in the usual sense of the word<br>
QUESTION So what is it that makes events at that<br>
 Who are the dancers and who the<br>
