<h1>Ersatz</h1>
<h2>by Henry Slesar</h2>

<p>There were sixteen hundred Peace Stations erected in the eighth year of the conflict, the contribution of the few remaining civilians on the American continent; sixteen hundred atomproofed shelters where the itinerant fighting man could find food, drink, and rest. Yet Sergeant Tod Halstead, in five dreary months of wandering across the wastelands of Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico, had relinquished hope of finding even one. In his lead-lined aluminum armor he appeared to be a perfectly packaged war machine, but the flesh within the gleaming housing was weak and unwashed and weary of the lonely, monotonous task of seeking a friend to join or an enemy to kill.</p>

<p>He was a Rocket Carrier, Third Class, the rank signifying that it was his duty to be a human launching pad for the four hydrogen-headed rockets strapped to his back, their fuses to be ignited by a Rocket Carrier, Second Class, upon command and countdown by a Rocket Carrier, First Class. Tod had lost the other two thirds of his unit months before; one of them had giggled and slipped a bayonet in his throat; the other had been shot and killed by a sixty-year-old farm wife who was resisting his desperate, amorous advances.</p>

<p>Then early one morning, after he was certain that the burst of light in the east was the sun and not the enemy's atomic fire, he trudged along a dusty road and saw beyond the shimmering waves of heat a square white building set amid a grove of naked gray trees. He stumbled towards it, and knew it was no mirage of the man-created desert, but a Peace Station. In its doorway a white-haired man with a Father Christmas face beckoned and smiled and helped him inside.</p>

<p><q>Thank God,</q> Tod said, falling into a chair. <q>Thank God. I'd almost given up&hellip;.</q></p>

<p>The jolly old man clapped his hands, and two young boys with hair like eagles’ nests came running into the room. Like service station attendants, they set about him busily, removing his helmet, his boots, unhooking his weapons. They fanned him, chafed his wrists, put cool lotion on his forehead; a few minutes later, his eyes closed, and with sleep approaching, he was conscious of a gentle hand on his cheek, and woke to find his months-old beard gone.</p>

<p><q>There now,</q> the station manager said, rubbing his hands in satisfaction. <q>Feel better, soldier?</q></p>

<p><q>Much better,</q> Tod said, looking about at the bare but comfortable room. <q>How does the war go with you, civilian?</q></p>

<p><q>Hard,</q> the man said, no longer jolly. <q>But we do our best, serving the fighting men as we can. But relax, soldier; food and drink will be here soon. It won't be anything special; our ersatz supply is low. There's a new chemical beef we've been saving, you can have that. I believe it's made of wood bark, but it's not at all bad on the tongue.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you have a cigarette?</q> Tod said.</p>

<p>He proffered a brown cylinder. <q>Ersatz, too, I'm afraid; treated wool fibers. But it burns, anyway.</q></p>

<p>Tod lit it. The acrid smoke seared his throat and lungs; he coughed, and put it out.</p>

<p><q>I'm sorry,</q> the station manager said sadly. <q>It's the best we have. Everything, everything is ersatz; our cigarettes, our food, our drink &hellip; the war goes hard with us all.</q></p>

<p>Tod sighed and leaned back. When the woman came out of the doorway, bearing a tray, he sat up and his eyes were first for the food. He didn't even notice how lovely she was, how her ragged, near-transparent gown hugged her rounded breasts and hips. When she bent towards him, handing him a steaming bowl of strange-smelling broth, her blonde hair tumbled forward and brushed his cheek. He looked up and caught her eyes; they dropped shyly.</p>

<p><q>You'll feel better after this,</q> she said huskily, and made a movement with her body that dulled his appetite for food, created a different kind of hunger. It was four years since he had seen a woman like this. The war had taken them first, with bombs and radio-active dust, all the young women who remained behind while the men escaped to the comparative safety of battle. He dipped into the broth and found it vile, but he downed every drop. The wood-based beef was tough and chewy, but it was better than the canned rations he had grown accustomed to. The bread tasted of seaweed, but he slathered it with an oily rancid oleo and chewed great mouthfuls.</p>

<p><q>I'm tired,</q> he said at last. <q>I'd like to sleep.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, of course,</q> the Peace Station manager said. <q>This way, soldier, come this way.</q></p>

<p>He followed him into a small windowless room, its only furniture a rusty metal cot. The sergeant dropped across its canvas mattress wearily, and the station manager closed the door quietly behind him. But Tod knew he wouldn't sleep, despite his sated stomach. His mind was too full, and his blood was streaming too fast through his veins, and the ache for the woman was strong in his body.</p>

<p>Then the door opened and she came in.</p>

<p>She said nothing. She came to the bed and sat beside him. She leaned over and kissed his mouth. <q>My name is Eleanora,</q> she whispered, and he seized her roughly. <q>No, wait,</q> she said, wriggling coyly out of his grasp. She got off the cot and went to the corner of the room.</p>

<p>He watched her slither out of her clothing. The blonde hair slipped as she pulled the dress over her head, and the curls hung at a crazy angle over her brow. She giggled, and put the wig back into position. Then she reached behind her and unhooked the brassiere; it dropped to the floor, revealing the flat slope of the hairy chest. She was about to remove the rest of her undergarments when the sergeant started to scream and run for the door; she reached out and held his arm and crooned words of love and pleading. He struck the creature with all the strength in his fist, and it fell to the floor, weeping bitterly, its skirt hoisted high on the muscular, hairy legs. The sergeant didn't pause to retrieve his armor or his weapons; he went out of the Peace Station into the smoky wasteland, where death awaited the unarmed and despairing.</p>

<p>Afterword:</p>

<p><q>Ersatz</q> is a rejected story. It was returned to me by an editor who simply said, <q>Don't like future-war stuff.</q> He isn't the only one with the attitude. Several editors feel that future wars don't really constitute a <q>dangerous vision,</q> and prefer their authors to steer clear of the subject. Atomic conflicts are <q>trite.</q> Postatomic holocausts are <q>cliché.</q> Armageddon is <q>overdone.</q> In the world of fiction, at least, there is some opinion that our case of atomic jitters has been cured, and that readers would rather do without reminders of ruin and radiation. But the playing field of science fiction is the future, and the future has to be extrapolated from the ingredients of the present. And if you don't think that those ingredients of doom are still with us, your radio needs tubes, your prescription needs changing, and you have wax in your ears. Personally, I hope our authors, particularly the science fiction writers who have special privileges and talents, continue to barrage the world with fresh words on the subject, to make us continually afraid of what might be, and continually concerned with prevention and cure. To me, the most dangerous vision of all is the one that's rose-colored, and I'm grateful that the editor of this volume has spectacles of clear glass.</p>
