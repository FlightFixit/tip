<h1>Riders of the Purple Wage or The Great Gavage</h1>
<h2>by Philip José Farmer</h2>

<p>If Jules Verne could really have looked into the future, say 1966 A.D., he would have crapped in his pants. And 2166, oh, my!</p>

<p>—from Grandpa Winnegan's unpublished Ms. <i>How I Screwed Uncle Sam &amp; Other Private Ejaculations</i>.</p>

<h3>The Cock that Crowed Backwards</h3>

<p>Un and Sub, the giants, are grinding him for bread.</p>

<p>Broken pieces float up through the wine of sleep. Vast treadings crush abysmal grapes for the incubus sacrament.</p>

<p>He as Simple Simon fishes in his soul as pail for the leviathan.</p>

<p>He groans, half-wakes, turns over, sweating dark oceans, and groans again. Un and Sub, putting their backs to their work, turn the stone wheels of the sunken mill, muttering Fie, fye, fo, fum. Eyes glittering orange-red as a cat's in a cubbyhole, teeth dull white digits in the murky arithmetic.</p>

<p>Un and Sub, Simple Simons themselves, busily mix metaphors non-self-consciously.</p>

<p>Dunghill and cock's egg: up rises the cockatrice and gives first crow, two more to come, in the flushrush of blood of dawn of I-am-the erection-and-the-strife.</p>

<p>It grows out and out until weight and length merge to curve it over, a not-yet weeping willow or broken reed. The one-eyed red head peeks over the edge of bed. It rests its chinless jaw, then, as body swells, slides over and down. Looking monocularly this way and those, it sniffs archaically across the floor and heads for the door, left open by the lapsus linguae of malingering sentinels.</p>

<p>A loud braying from the center of the room makes it turn back. The three-legged ass, Baalim's easel, is heehawing. On the easel is the <q>canvas,</q> an oval shallow pan of irradiated plastic, specially treated. The canvas is seven feet high and eighteen inches deep. Within the painting is a scene that must be finished by tomorrow.</p>

<p>As much sculpture as painting, the figures are in alto-relief, rounded, some nearer the back of the pan than others. They glow with light from outside and also from the self-luminous plastic of the <q>canvas.</q> The light seems to enter the figures, soak awhile, then break loose. The light is pale red, the red of dawn, of blood watered with tears, of anger, of ink on the debit side of the ledger.</p>

<p>This is one of his Dog Series: <cite>Dogmas from a Dog</cite>, <cite>The Aerial Dog-fight</cite>, <cite>Dog Days</cite>, <cite>The Sundog</cite>, <cite>Dog Reversed</cite>, <cite>The Dog of Flinders</cite>, <cite>Dog Berries</cite>, <cite>Dog Catcher</cite>, <cite>Lying Doggo</cite>, <cite>The Dog of the Right Angle</cite>, and <cite>Improvisations on a Dog</cite>.</p>

<p>Socrates, Ben Jonson, Cellini, Swedenborg, Li Po, and Hiawatha are roistering in the Mermaid Tavern. Through a window, Daedalus is seen on top of the battlements of Cnossus, shoving a rocket up the ass of his son, Icarus, to give him a jet-assisted takeoff for his famous flight. In one corner crouches Og, Son of Fire. He gnaws on a sabertooth bone and paints bison and mammoths on the mildewed plaster. The barmaid, Athena, is bending over the table where she is serving nectar and pretzels to her distinguished customers. Aristotle, wearing goat's horns, is behind her. He has lifted her skirt and is tupping her from behind. The ashes from the cigarette dangling from his smirking lips have fallen onto her skirt, which is beginning to smoke. In the doorway of the men's room, a drunken Batman succumbs to a long-repressed desire and attempts to bugger the Boy Wonder. Through another window is a lake on the surface of which a man is walking, a green-tarnished halo hovering over his head. Behind him a periscope sticks out of the water.</p>

<p>Prehensile, the penisnake wraps itself around the brush and begins to paint. The brush is a small cylinder attached at one end to a hose which runs to a dome-shaped machine. From the other end of the cylinder extends a nozzle. The aperture of this can be decreased or increased by rotation of a thumb-dial on the cylinder. The paint which the nozzle deposits in a fine spray or in a thick stream or in whatever color or hue desired is controlled by several dials on the cylinder.</p>

<p>Furiously, proboscisean, it builds up another figure layer by layer. Then, it sniffs a musty odor of must and drops the brush and slides out the door and down the bend of wall of oval hall, describing the scrawl of legless creatures, a writing in the sand which all may read but few understand. Blood pumppumps in rhythm with the mills of Un and Sub to feed and swill the hot-blooded reptile. But the walls, detecting intrusive mass and extrusive desire, glow.</p>

<p>He groans, and the glandular cobra rises and sways to the fluting of his wish for cuntcealment. Let there not be light! The nights must be his cloaka. Speed past mother's room, nearest the exit. Ah! Sighs softly in relief but air whistles through the vertical and tight mouth, announcing the departure of the exsupress for Desideratum.</p>

<p>The door has become archaic; it has a keyhole. Quick! Up the ramp and out of the house through the keyhole and out onto the street. One person abroad a broad, a young woman with phosphorescent silver hair and snatch to match.</p>

<p>Out and down the street and coiling around her ankle. She looks down with surprise and then fear. He likes this; too willing were too many. He's found a diamond in the ruff.</p>

<p>Up around her kitten-ear-soft leg, around and around, and sliding across the dale of groin. Nuzzling the tender corkscrewed hairs and then, self-Tantalus, detouring up the slight convex of belly, saying hello to the bellybutton, pressing on it to ring upstairs, around and around the narrow waist and shyly and quickling snatching a kiss from each nipple. Then back down to form an expedition for climbing the mons veneris and planting the flag thereon.</p>

<p>Oh, delectation tabu and sickersacrosanct! There's a baby in there, ectoplasm beginning to form in eager preanticipation of actuality. Drop, egg, and shoot the chutychutes of flesh, hastening to gulp the lucky Micromoby Dick, outwriggling its million million brothers, survival of the fightingest.</p>

<p>A vast croaking fills the hall. The hot breath chills the skin. He sweats. Icicles coat the tumorous fuselage, and it sags under the weight of ice, and fog rolls around, whistling past the struts, and the ailerons and elevators are locked in ice, and he's losing altiattitude fast. Get up, get up! Venusberg somewhere ahead in the mists; Tannhäuser, blow your strumpets, send up your flares, I'm in a nosedive.</p>

<p>Mother's door has opened. A toad squatfills the ovoid doorway. Its dewlap rises and falls bellows-like; its toothless mouth gawps. Ginungagap. Forked tongue shoots out and curls around the boar cuntstrictor. He cries out with both mouths and jerks this way and those. The waves of denial run through. Two webbed paws bend and tie the flopping body into a knot—a runny shapeshank, of course.</p>

<p>The woman strolls on. Wait for me! Out the flood roars, crashes into the knot, roars back, ebb clashing with flood. Too much and only one way to go. He jerkspurts, the firmament of waters falling, no Noah's ark or arc; he novas, a shatter of millions of glowing wriggling meteors, flashes in the pan of existence.</p>

<p>Thigh kingdom come. Groin and belly encased in musty armor, and he cold, wet, and trembling.</p>

<h3>God's Patent On Dawn Expires</h3>

<p>&hellip;the following spoken by Alfred Melophon Voxpopper, of the Aurora Pushups and Coffee Hour, Channel 69B. Lines taped during the 50th Folk Art Center Annual Demonstration and Competition, Beverly Hills, level 14. Spoken by Omar Bacchylides Runic, extemporaneously if you discount some forethought during the previous evening at the nonpublic tavern The Private Universe, and you may because Runic did not remember a thing about that evening. Despite which he won First Laurel Wreath A, there being no Second, Third, etc., wreaths classified as A through Z, God bless our democracy.</p>

<p>A gray-pink salmon leaping up the falls of night</p>

<p>Into the spawning pool of another day.</p>

<p>Dawn—the red roar of the heliac bull</p>

<p>Charging over the horizon.</p>

<p>The photonic blood of bleeding night,</p>

<p>Stabbed by the assassin sun.</p>

<p>and so on for fifty lines punctuated and fractured by cheers, handclaps, boos, hisses, and yelps.</p>

<p>Chib is half-awake. He peeps down into the narrowing dark as the dream roars off into the subway tunnel. He peeps through barely opened lids at the other reality: consciousness.</p>

<p><q>Let my peeper go!</q> he groans with Moses and so, thinking of long beards and horns (courtesy of Michelangelo), he thinks of his great-great-grandfather.</p>

<p>The will, a crowbar, forces his eyelids open. He sees the fido which spans the wall opposite him and curves up over half the ceiling. Dawn, the paladin of the sun, is flinging its gray gauntlet down.</p>

<p>Channel 69B, <span class="small-caps">Your Favorite Channel</span>, LA's own, brings you dawn. (Deception in depth. Nature's false dawn shadowed forth with electrons shaped by devices shaped by man.)</p>

<p>Wake up with the sun in your heart and a song on your lips! Thrill to the stirring lines of Omar Runic! See dawn as the birds in the trees, as God, see it!</p>

<p>Voxpopper chants the lines softly while Grieg's <cite>Anitra</cite> wells softly. The old Norwegian never dreamed of this audience and just as well. A young man, Chibiabos Elgreco Winnegan, has a sticky wick, courtesy of a late gusher in the oilfield of the unconscious.</p>

<p><q>Off your ass and onto your steed,</q> Chib says. <q>Pegasus runs today.</q></p>

<p>He speaks, thinks, lives in the present tensely.</p>

<p>Chib climbs out of bed and shoves it into the wall. To leave the bed sticking out, rumpled as an old drunkard's tongue, would fracture the aesthetics of his room, destroy that curve that is the reflection of the basic universe, and hinder him in his work.</p>

<p>The room is a huge ovoid and in a corner is a small ovoid, the toilet and shower. He comes out of it looking like one of Homer's god-like Achaeans, massively thighed, great-armed, golden-brown-skinned, blue-eyed, auburn-haired—although beardless. The phone is simulating the tocsin of a South American tree frog he once heard over Channel 122.</p>

<p><q>Open O sesame!</q></p>

<h3>Inter Caecos Regnat Luscus</h3>

<p>The face of Rex Luscus spreads across the fido, the pores of skin like the cratered fields of a World War I battlefield. He wears a black monocle over the left eye, ripped out in a brawl among art critics during the <i>I Love Rembrandt Lecture Series</i>, Channel 109. Although he has enough pull to get a priority for eye-replacement, he has refused.</p>

<p><q><i>Inter caecos regnat luscus</i>,</q> he says when asked about it and quite often when not. <q>Translation: among the blind, the one-eyed man is king. That's why I renamed myself Rex Luscus, that is, King One-eyed.</q></p>

<p>There is a rumor, fostered by Luscus, that he will permit the bioboys to put in an artificial protein eye when he sees the works of an artist great enough to justify focal vision. It is also rumored that he may do so soon, because of his discovery of Chibiabos Elgreco Winnegan.</p>

<p>Luscus looks hungrily (he swears by adverbs) at Chib's tomentum and outlying regions. Chib swells, not with tumescence but with anger.</p>

<p>Luscus says, smoothly, <q>Honey, I just want to reassure myself that you're up and about the tremendously important business of this day. You must be ready for the showing, must! But now I see you, I'm reminded I've not eaten yet. What about breakfast with me?</q></p>

<p><q>What're we eating?</q> Chib says. He does not wait for a reply. <q>No. I've too much to do today. Close O sesame!</q></p>

<p>Rex Luscus’ face fades away, goatlike, or, as he prefers to describe it, the face of Pan, a Faunus of the arts. He has even had his ears trimmed to a point. Real cute.</p>

<p><q>Baa-aa-aa!</q> Chib bleats at the phantom. <q>Ba! Humbuggery! I'll never kiss your ass, Luscus, or let you kiss mine. Even if I lose the grant!</q></p>

<p>The phone bells again. The dark face of Rousseau Red Hawk appears. His nose is as the eagle's, and his eyes are broken black glass. His broad forehead is bound with a strip of red cloth, which circles the straight black hair that glides down to his shoulders. His shirt is buckskin; a necklace of beads hangs from his neck. He looks like a Plains Indian, although Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, or the noblest Roman Nose of them all would have kicked him out of the tribe. Not that they were anti-Semitic, they just could not have respected a brave who broke out into hives when near a horse.</p>

<p>Born Julius Applebaum, he legally became Rousseau Red Hawk on his Naming Day. Just returned from the forest reprimevalized, he is now reveling in the accursed fleshpots of a decadent civilization.</p>

<p><q>How're you, Chib? The gang's wondering how soon you'll get here?</q></p>

<p><q>Join you? I haven't had breakfast yet, and I've a thousand things to do to get ready for the showing. I'll see you at noon!</q></p>

<p><q>You missed out on the fun last night. Some goddam Egyptians tried to feel the girls up, but we salaamed them against the walls.</q></p>

<p>Rousseau vanished like the last of the red men.</p>

<p>Chib thinks of breakfast just as the intercom whistles. Open O sesame! He sees the living room. Smoke, too thick and furious for the air-conditioning to whisk away, roils. At the far end of the ovoid, his little half-brother and half-sister sleep on a flato. Playing Mama-and-friend, they fell asleep, their mouths open in blessed innocence, beautiful as only sleeping children can be. Opposite the closed eyes of each is an unwinking eye like that of a Mongolian Cyclops.</p>

<p><q>Ain't they cute?</q> Mama says. <q>The darlings were just too tired to toddle off.</q></p>

<p>The table is round. The aged knights and ladies are gathered around it for the latest quest of the ace, king, queen, and jack. They are armored only in layer upon layer of fat. Mama's jowls hang down like banners on a windless day. Her breasts creep and quiver on the table, bulge, and ripple.</p>

<p><q>A gam of gamblers,</q> he says aloud, looking at the fat faces, the tremendous tits, the rampant rumps. They raise their eyebrows. What the hell's the mad genius talking about now?</p>

<p><q>Is your kid really retarded?</q> says one of Mama's friends, and they laugh and drink some more beer. Angela Ninon, not wanting to miss out on this deal and figuring Mama will soon turn on the sprayers anyway, pisses down her leg. They laugh at this, and William Conqueror says, <q>I open.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm always open,</q> Mama says, and they shriek with laughter.</p>

<p>Chib would like to cry. He does not cry, although he has been encouraged from childhood to cry any time he feels like it.</p>

<p>—It makes you feel better and look at the Vikings, what men they were and they cried like babies whenever they felt like it—Courtesy of Channel 202 on the popular program <i>What's A Mother Done</i>?</p>

<p>He does not cry because he feels like a man who thinks about the mother he loved and who is dead but who died a long time ago. His mother has been long buried under a landslide of flesh. When he was sixteen, he had had a lovely mother.</p>

<p>Then she cut him off.</p>

<h3>The Family that Blows Is the Family that Grows</h3>

<p>—from a poem by Edgar A. Grist, via Channel 88.</p>

<p><q>Son, I don't get much out of this. I just do it because I love you.</q></p>

<p>Then, fat, fat, fat! Where did she go? Down into the adipose abyss. Disappearing as she grew larger.</p>

<p><q>Sonny, you could at least wrestle with me a little now and then.</q></p>

<p><q>You cut me off, Mama. That was all right. I'm a big boy now. But you haven't any right to expect me to want to take it up again.</q></p>

<p><q>You don't love me any more!</q></p>

<p><q>What's for breakfast, Mama?</q> Chib says.</p>

<p><q>I'm holding a good hand, Chibby,</q> Mama says. <q>As you've told me so many times, you're a big boy. Just this once, get your own breakfast.</q></p>

<p><q>What's you call me for?</q></p>

<p><q>I forgot when your exhibition starts. I wanted to get some sleep before I went.</q></p>

<p><q>14:30, Mama, but you don't have to go.</q></p>

<p>Rouged green lips part like a gangrened wound. She scratches one rouged nipple. <q>Oh, I want to be there. I don't want to miss my own son's artistic triumphs. Do you think you'll get the grant?</q></p>

<p><q>If I don't, it's Egypt for us,</q> he says.</p>

<p><q>Those stinking Arabs!</q> says William Conqueror.</p>

<p><q>It's the Bureau that's doing it, not the Arabs,</q> Chib says. <q>The Arabs moved for the same reason we may have to move.</q></p>

<p><i>From Grandpa's unpublished Ms</i>.: Whoever would have thought that Beverly Hills would become anti-Semitic?</p>

<p><q>I don't want to go to Egypt!</q> Mama wails. <q>You got to get that grant, Chibby. I don't want to leave the clutch. I was born and raised here, well, on the tenth level, anyway, and when I moved all my friends went along. I won't go!</q></p>

<p><q>Don't cry, Mama,</q> Chib says, feeling distress despite himself. <q>Don't cry. The government can't force you to go, you know. You got your rights.</q></p>

<p><q>If you want to keep on having goodies, you'll go,</q> says Conqueror. <q>Unless Chib wins the grant, that is. And I wouldn't blame him if he didn't even try to win it. It ain't his fault you can't say no to Uncle Sam. You got your purple and the yap Chib makes from selling his paintings. Yet it ain't enough. You spend faster than you get it.</q></p>

<p>Mama screams with fury at William, and they're off. Chib cuts off fido. Hell with breakfast; he'll eat later. His final painting for the Festival must be finished by noon. He presses a plate, and the bare egg-shaped room opens here and there, and painting equipment comes out like a gift from the electronic gods. Zeuxis would flip and Van Gogh would get the shakes if they could see the canvas and palette and brush Chib uses.</p>

<p>The process of painting involves the individual bending and twisting of thousands of wires into different shapes at various depths. The wires are so thin they can be seen only with magnifiers and manipulated with exceedingly delicate pliers. Hence, the goggles he wears and the long almost-gossamer instrument in his hand when he is in the first stages of creating a painting. After hundreds of hours of slow and patient labor (of love), the wires are arranged.</p>

<p>Chib removes his goggles to perceive the overall effect. He then uses the paint-sprayer to cover the wires with the colors and hues he desires. The paint dries hard within a few minutes. Chib attaches electrical leads to the pan and presses a button to deliver a tiny voltage through the wires. These glow beneath the paint and, Lilliputian fuses, disappear in blue smoke.</p>

<p>The result is a three-dimensional work composed of hard shells of paint on several levels below the exterior shell. The shells are of varying thicknesses and all are so thin that light slips through the upper to the inner shell when the painting is turned at angles. Parts of the shells are simply reflectors to intensify the light so that the inner images may be more visible.</p>

<p>When being shown, the painting is on a self-moving pedestal which turns the painting 12 degrees to the left from the center and then 12 degrees to the right from the center.</p>

<p>The fido tocsins. Chib, cursing, thinks of disconnecting it. At least, it's not the intercom with his mother calling hysterically. Not yet, anyway. She'll call soon enough if she loses heavily at poker.</p>

<p>Open O sesame!</p>

<h3>Sing, O Mews, of Uncle Sam</h3>

<p>Grandpa writes in his <cite>Private Ejaculations</cite>: Twenty-five years after I fled with twenty billion dollars and then supposedly died of a heart attack, Falco Accipiter is on my trail again. The IRB detective who named himself Falcon Hawk when he entered his profession. What an egotist! Yet, he is as sharp-eyed and relentless as a bird of prey, and I would shiver if I were not too old to be frightened by mere human beings. Who loosed the jesses and hood? How did he pick up the old and cold scent?</p>

<p>Accipiter's face is that of an overly suspicious peregrine that tries to look everywhere while it soars, that peers up its own anus to make sure that no duck has taken refuge there. The pale blue eyes fling glances like knives shot out of a shirtsleeve and hurled with a twist of the wrist. They scan all with sherlockian intake of minute and significant detail. His head turns back and forth, ears twitching, nostrils expanding and collapsing, all radar and sonar and odar.</p>

<p><q>Mr. Winnegan, I'm sorry to call so early. Did I get you out of bed?</q></p>

<p><q>It's obvious you didn't!</q> Chib says. <q>Don't bother to introduce yourself. I know you. You've been shadowing me for three days.</q></p>

<p>Accipiter does not redden. Master of control, he does all his blushing in the depths of his bowels, where no one can see. <q>If you know me, perhaps you can tell me why I'm calling you?</q></p>

<p><q>Would I be dumbshit enough to tell you?</q></p>

<p><q>Mr. Winnegan, I'd like to talk to you about your great-great-grandfather.</q></p>

<p><q>He's been dead for twenty-five years!</q> Chib cries. <q>Forget him. And don't bother me. Don't try for a search warrant. No judge would give you one. A man's home is his hassle &hellip; I mean castle.</q></p>

<p>He thinks of Mama and what the day is going to be like unless he gets out soon. But he has to finish the painting.</p>

<p><q>Fade off, Accipiter,</q> Chib says. <q>I think I'll report you to the BPHR. I'm sure you got a fido inside that silly-looking hat of yours.</q></p>

<p>Accipiter's face is as smooth and unmoving as an alabaster carving of the falcon-god Horus. He may have a little gas bulging his intestines. If so, he slips it out unnoticed.</p>

<p><q>Very well, Mr. Winnegan. But you're not getting rid of me that easily. After all&hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>Fade out!</q></p>

<p>The intercom whistles thrice. What I tell you three times is Grandpa. <q>I was eavesdropping,</q> says the 120-year-old voice, hollow and deep as an echo from a Pharaoh's tomb. <q>I want to see you before you leave. That is, if you can spare the Ancient of Daze a few minutes.</q></p>

<p><q>Always, Grandpa,</q> Chib says, thinking of how much he loves the old man. <q>You need any food?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, and for the mind, too.</q></p>

<p><i>Der Tag. Dies Irae. Götterdammerung</i>. Armageddon. Things are closing in. Make-or-break day. Go-no-go time. All these calls and a feeling of more to come. What will the end of the day bring?</p>

<h3>The Troche Sun Slips Into the Sore Throat of Night</h3>

<p>—from Omar Runic</p>

<p>Chib walks towards the convex door, which rolls into the interstices between the walls. The focus of the house is the oval family room. In the first quadrant, going clockwise, is the kitchen, separated from the family room by six-meter-high accordion screens, painted with scenes from Egyptian tombs by Chib, his too subtle comment on modern food. Seven slim pillars around the family room mark the borders of room and corridor. Between the pillars are more tall accordion screens, painted by Chib during his Amerind mythology phase.</p>

<p>The corridor is also oval-shaped; every room in the house opens onto it. There are seven rooms, six bedroom-workroom-study-toilet-shower combinations. The seventh is a storeroom.</p>

<p>Little eggs within bigger eggs within great eggs within a megamonolith on a planetary pear within an ovoid universe, the latest cosmogony indicating that infinity has the form of a hen's fruit. God broods over the abyss and cackles every trillion years or so.</p>

<p>Chib cuts across the hall, passes between two pillars, carved by him into nymphet caryatids, and enters the family room. His mother looks sidewise at her son, who she thinks is rapidly approaching insanity if he has not already overshot his mark. It's partly her fault; she shouldn't have gotten disgusted and in a moment of wackiness called It off. Now, she's fat and ugly, oh, God, so fat and ugly. She can't reasonably or even unreasonably hope to start up again.</p>

<p>It's only natural, she keeps telling herself, sighing, resentful, teary, that he's abandoned the love of his mother for the strange, firm, shapely delights of young women. But to give them up, too? He's not a fairy. He quit all that when he was thirteen. So what's the reason for his chastity? He isn't in love with the fornixator, either, which she would understand, even if she did not approve.</p>

<p>Oh, God, where did I go wrong? And then, There's nothing wrong with me. He's going crazy like his father—Raleigh Renaissance, I think his name was—and his aunt and his great-great-grandfather. It's all that painting and those radicals, the Young Radishes, he runs around with. He's too artistic, too sensitive. Oh, God, if something happens to my little boy, I'll have to go to Egypt.</p>

<p>Chib knows her thoughts since she's voiced them so many times and is not capable of having new ones. He passes the round table without a word. The knights and ladies of the canned Camelot see him through a beery veil.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, he opens an oval door in the wall. He removes a tray with food in covered dishes and cups, all wrapped in plastic.</p>

<p><q>Aren't you going to eat with us?</q></p>

<p><q>Don't whine, Mama,</q> he says and goes back to his room to pick up some cigars for his Grandpa. The door, detecting, amplifying, and transmitting the shifting but recognizable eidolon of epidermal electrical fields to the activating mechanism, balks. Chib is too upset. Magnetic maelstroms rage over his skin and distort the spectral configuration. The door half-rolls out, rolls in, changes its mind again, rolls out, rolls in.</p>

<p>Chib kicks the door and it becomes completely blocked. He decides he'll have a video or vocal sesame put in. Trouble is, he's short of units and coupons and can't buy the materials. He shrugs and walks along the curving, one-walled hall and stops in front of Grandpa's door, hidden from view of those in the living room by the kitchen screens.</p>

<p class="noindent"><q>For he sang of peace and freedom,<br/>

Sang of beauty, love, and longing;<br/>

Sang of death, and life undying<br/>

In the Islands of the Blessed,<br/>

In the kingdom of Ponemah,<br/>

In the land of the Hereafter.<br/>

Very dear to Hiawatha<br/>

Was the gentle Chibiabos.</q></p>

<p>Chib chants the passwords; the door rolls back.</p>

<p>Light glares out, a yellowish red-tinged light that is Grandpa's own creation. Looking into the convex oval door is like looking into the lens of a madman's eyeball. Grandpa, in the middle of the room, has a white beard falling to midthigh and white hair cataracting to just below the back of his knees. Although beard and headhair conceal his nakedness, and he is not out in public, he wears a pair of shorts. Grandpa is somewhat old-fashioned, forgivable in a man of twelve decadencies.</p>

<p>Like Rex Luscus, he is one-eyed. He smiles with his own teeth, grown from buds transplanted thirty years ago. A big green cigar sticks out of one corner of his full red mouth. His nose is broad and smeared as if time had stepped upon it with a heavy foot. His forehead and cheeks are broad, perhaps due to a shot of Ojibway blood in his veins, though he was born Finnegan and even sweats celtically, giving off an aroma of whiskey. He holds his head high, and the blue-gray eye is like a pool at the bottom of a prediluvian pothole, remnant of a melted glacier.</p>

<p>All in all, Grandpa's face is Odin's as he returns from the Well of Mimir, wondering if he paid too great a price. Or it is the face of the windbeaten, sandblown Sphinx of Gizeh.</p>

<p><q>Forty centuries of hysteria look down upon you, to paraphrase Napoleon,</q> Grandpa says. <q>The rockhead of the ages. <i>What, then, is Man</i>? sayeth the New Sphinx, Edipus having resolved the question of the Old Sphinx and settling nothing because She had already delivered another of her kind, a smartass kid with a question nobody's been able to answer yet. And perhaps just as well it can't be.</q></p>

<p><q>You talk funny,</q> Chib says. <q>But I like it.</q></p>

<p>He grins at Grandpa, loving him.</p>

<p><q class="continued">You sneak into here every day, not so much from love for me as to gain knowledge and insight. I have seen all, heard everything, and thought more than a little. I voyaged much before I took refuge in this room a quarter of a century ago. Yet confinement here has been the greatest Odyssey of all.</q></p>

<h3>The Ancient Marinator</h3>

<p><q>I call myself. A marinade of wisdom steeped in the brine of over-salted cynicism and too long a life.</q></p>

<p><q>You smile so, you must have just had a woman,</q> Chib teases.</p>

<p><q class="continued">No, my boy. I lost the tension in my ramrod thirty years ago. And I thank God for that, since it removes from me the temptation of fornication, not to mention masturbation. However, I have other energies left, hence, scope for other sins, and these are even more serious.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Aside from the sin of sexual commission, which paradoxically involves the sin of sexual emission, I had other reasons for not asking that Old Black Magician Science for shots to starch me out again. I was too old for young girls to be attracted to me for anything but money. And I was too much a poet, a lover of beauty, to take on the wrinkled blisters of my generation or several just before mine.</q></p>

<p><q>So now you see, my son. My clapper swings limberly in the bell of my sex. Ding, dong, ding, dong. A lot of dong but not much ding.</q></p>

<p>Grandpa laughs deeply, a lion's roar with a spray of doves.</p>

<p><q>I am but the mouthpiece of the ancients, a shyster pleading for long-dead clients. Come not to bury but to praise and forced by my sense of fairness to admit the faults of the past, too. I'm a queer crabbed old man, pent like Merlin in his tree trunk. Samolxis, the Thracian bear god, hibernating in his cave. The Last of the Seven Sleepers.</q></p>

<p>Grandpa goes to the slender plastic tube depending from the ceiling and pulls down the folding handles of the eyepiece.</p>

<p><q>Accipiter is hovering outside our house. He smells something rotten in Beverly Hills, level 14. Could it be that Win-again Winnegan isn't dead? Uncle Sam is like a diplodocus kicked in the ass. It takes twenty-five years for the message to reach its brain.</q></p>

<p>Tears appear in Chib's eyes. He says, <q>Oh, God, Grandpa, I don't want anything to happen to you.</q></p>

<p><q>What can happen to a 120-year-old man besides failure of brain or kidneys?</q></p>

<p><q>With all due respect, Grandpa,</q> Chib says, <q>you do rattle on.</q></p>

<p><q>Call me Id's mill,</q> Grandpa says. <q>The flour it yields is baked in the strange oven of my ego—or half-baked, if you please.</q></p>

<p>Chib grins through his tears and says, <q>They taught me at school that puns are cheap and vulgar.</q></p>

<p><q>What's good enough for Homer, Aristophanes, Rabelais, and Shakespeare is good enough for me. By the way, speaking of cheap and vulgar, I met your mother in the hall last night, before the poker party started. I was just leaving the kitchen with a bottle of booze. She almost fainted. But she recovered fast and pretended not to see me. Maybe she did think she'd seen a ghost. I doubt it. She'd have been blabbing all over town about it.</q></p>

<p><q>She may have told her doctor,</q> Chib says. <q>She saw you several weeks ago, remember? She may have mentioned it while she was bitching about her so-called dizzy spells and hallucinations.</q></p>

<p><q>And the old sawbones, knowing the family history, called the IRB. Maybe.</q></p>

<p>Chib looks through the periscope's eyepiece. He rotates it and turns the knobs on the handle-ends to raise and lower the cyclops on the end of the tube outside. Accipiter is stalking around the aggregate of seven eggs, each on the end of a broad thin curved branchlike walk projecting from the central pedestal. Accipiter goes up the steps of a branch to the door of Mrs. Applebaum's. The door opens.</p>

<p><q>He must have caught her away from the fornixator,</q> Chib says. <q>And she must be lonely; she's not talking to him over fido. My God, she's fatter than Mama!</q></p>

<p><q>Why not?</q> Grandpa says. <q>Mr. and Mrs. Everyman sit on their asses all day, drink, eat, and watch fido, and their brains run to mud and their bodies to sludge. Caesar would have had no trouble surrounding himself with fat friends these days. You ate, too, Brutus?</q></p>

<p>Grandpa's comment, however, should not apply to Mrs. Applebaum. She has a hole in her head, and people addicted to fornixation seldom get fat. They sit or lie all day and part of the night, the needle in the fornix area of the brain delivering a series of minute electrical jolts. Indescribable ecstasy floods through their bodies with every impulse, a delight far surpassing any of food, drink, or sex. It's illegal, but the government never bothers a user unless it wants to get him for something else, since a fornic rarely has children. Twenty per cent of LA have had holes drilled in their heads and tiny shafts inserted for access of the needle. Five per cent are addicted; they waste away, seldom eating, their distended bladders spilling poisons into the bloodstream.</p>

<p>Chib says, <q>My brother and sister must have seen you sometimes when you were sneaking out to mass. Could they&hellip;?</q></p>

<p><q>They think I'm a ghost, too. In this day and age! Still, maybe it's a good sign that they can believe in something, even a spook.</q></p>

<p><q>You better stop sneaking out to church.</q></p>

<p><q>The Church, and you, are the only things that keep me going. It was a sad day, though, when you told me you couldn't believe. You would have made a good priest—with faults, of course—and I could have had private mass and confession in this room.</q></p>

<p>Chib says nothing. He's gone to instruction and observed services just to please Grandpa. The church was an egg-shaped seashell which, held to the ear, gave only the distant roar of God receding like an ebb tide.</p>

<h3>There Are Universes Begging for Gods</h3>

<p>yet He hangs around this one looking for work.</p>

<p>—from Grandpa's Ms.</p>

<p>Grandpa takes over the eyepiece. He laughs. <q>The Internal Revenue Bureau! I thought it'd been disbanded! Who the hell has an income big enough to report on any more? Do you suppose it's still active just because of me? Could be.</q></p>

<p>He calls Chib back to the scope, directed towards the center of Beverly Hills. Chib has a lane of vision between the seven-egged clutches on the branched pedestals. He can see part of the central plaza, the giant ovoids of the city hall, the federal bureaus, the Folk Center, part of the massive spiral on which set the houses of worship, and the dora (from pandora) where those on the purple wage get their goods and those with extra income get their goodies. One end of the big artificial lake is visible; boats and canoes sail on it and people fish.</p>

<p>The irradiated plastic dome that enfolds the clutches of Beverly Hills is sky-blue. The electronic sun climbs towards the zenith. There are a few white genuine-looking images of clouds and even a V of geese migrating south, their honks coming down faintly. Very nice for those who have never been outside the walls of LA. But Chib spent two years in the World Nature Rehabilitation and Conservation Corps—the WNRCC—and he knows the difference. Almost, he decided to desert with Rousseau Red Hawk and join the neo-Amerinds. Then, he was going to become a forest ranger. But this might mean he'd end up shooting or arresting Red Hawk. Besides, he didn't want to become a sammer. And he wanted more than anything to paint.</p>

<p><q>There's Rex Luscus,</q> Chib says. <q>He's being interviewed outside the Folk Center. Quite a crowd.</q></p>

<h3>The Pellucidar Breakthrough</h3>

<p>Luscus’ middle name should have been Upmanship. A man of great erudition, with privileged access to the Library of Greater LA computer, and of Ulyssean sneakiness, he is always scoring over his colleagues.</p>

<p>He it was who founded the Go-Go School of Criticism.</p>

<p>Primalux Ruskinson, his great competitor, did some extensive research when Luscus announced the title of his new philosophy. Ruskinson triumphantly announced that Luscus had taken the phrase from obsolete slang, current in the mid-twentieth century.</p>

<p>Luscus, in the fido interview next day, said that Ruskinson was a rather shallow scholar, which was to be expected.</p>

<p><i>Go-go</i> was taken from the Hottentot language. In Hottentot, <i>go-go</i> meant to examine, that is, to keep looking until something about the object—in this case, the artist and his works—has been observed.</p>

<p>The critics got in line to sign up at the new school. Ruskinson thought of committing suicide, but instead accused Luscus of having blown his way up the ladder of success.</p>

<p>Luscus replied on fido that his personal life was his own, and Ruskinson was in danger of being sued for violation of privacy. However, he deserved no more effort than a man striking at a mosquito.</p>

<p><q>What the hell's a mosquito?</q> say millions of viewers. <q>Wish the bighead would talk language we could understand.</q></p>

<p>Luscus’ voice fades off for a minute while the interpreters explain, having just been slipped a note from a monitor who's run off the word through the station's encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Luscus rode on the novelty of the Go-Go School for two years.</p>

<p>Then he re-established his prestige, which had been slipping somewhat, with his philosophy of the Totipotent Man.</p>

<p>This was so popular that the Bureau of Cultural Development and Recreation requisitioned a daily one-hour slot for a year-and-a-half in the initial program of totipotentializing.</p>

<p>Grandpa Winnegan's penned comment in his <cite>Private Ejaculations</cite>:</p>

<p>What about The Totipotent Man, that apotheosis of individuality and complete psychosomatic development, the democratic Übermensch, as recommended by Rex Luscus, the sexually one-sided? Poor old Uncle Sam! Trying to force the proteus of his citizens into a single stabilized shape so he can control them. And at the same time trying to encourage each and every to bring to flower his inherent capabilities—if any! The poor old long-legged, chin-whiskered, milk-hearted, flint-brained schizophrenic! Verily, the left hand knows not what the right hand is doing. As a matter of fact, the right hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.</p>

<p><q>What about the totipotent man?</q> Luscus replied to the chairman during the fourth session of the <i>Luscan Lecture Series</i>. <q>How does he conflict with the contemporary Zeitgeist? He doesn't. The totipotent man is the imperative of our times. He must come into being before the Golden World can be realized. How can you have a Utopia without utopians, a Golden World with men of brass?</q></p>

<p>It was during this Memorable Day that Luscus gave his talk on The Pellucidar Breakthrough and thereby made Chibiabos Winnegan famous. And more than incidentally gave Luscus his biggest score over his competitors.</p>

<p><q>Pellucidar? Pellucidar?</q> Ruskinson mutters. <q>Oh, God, what's Tinker Bell doing now?</q></p>

<p><q>It'll take me some time to explain why I use this phrase to describe Winnegan's stroke of genius,</q> Luscus continues. <q class="continued">First, let me seem to detour</q></p>

<h3>From the Arctic to Illinois</h3>

<p><q class="continued">Now, Confucius once said that a bear could not fart at the North Pole without causing a big wind in Chicago.</q></p>

<p><q>By this he meant that all events, therefore, all men, are interconnected in an unbreakable web. What one man does, no matter how seemingly insignificant, vibrates through the strands and affects every man.</q></p>

<p>Ho Chung Ko, before his fido on the 30th level of Lhasa, Tibet, says to his wife, <q>That white prick has got it all wrong. Confucius didn't say that. Lenin preserve us! I'm going to call him up and give him hell.</q></p>

<p>His wife says, <q>Let's change the channel. Pai Ting Place is on now, and&hellip;</q></p>

<p>Ngombe, 10th level, Nairobi: <q>The critics here are a bunch of black bastards. Now you take Luscus; he could see my genius in a second. I'm going to apply for emigration in the morning.</q></p>

<p>Wife: <q>You might at least ask me if I want to go! What about the kids &hellip; mother &hellip; friends &hellip; dog&hellip;?</q> and so on into the lionless night of self-luminous Africa.</p>

<p><q>&hellip;ex-president Radinoff,</q> Luscus continues, <q>once said that this is the ‘Age of the Plugged-In Man.’ Some rather vulgar remarks have been made about this, to me, insighted phrase. But Radinoff did not mean that human society is a daisy chain. He meant that the current of modern society flows through the circuit of which we are all part. This is the Age of Complete Interconnection. No wires can hang loose; otherwise we all short-circuit. Yet, it is undeniable that life without individuality is not worth living. Every man must be a <i>hapax legomenon</i>&hellip;</q></p>

<p>Ruskinson jumps up from his chair and screams, <q>I know that phrase! I got you this time, Luscus!</q></p>

<p>He is so excited he falls over in a faint, symptom of a widespread hereditary defect. When he recovers, the lecture is over. He springs to the recorder to run off what he missed. But Luscus has carefully avoided defining The Pellucidar Breakthrough. He will explain it at another lecture.</p>

<p>Grandpa, back at the scope, whistles. <q class="continued">I feel like an astronomer. The planets are in orbit around our house, the sun. There's Accipiter, the closest, Mercury, although he's not the god of thieves but their nemesis. Next, Benedictine, your sad-sack Venus. Hard, hard, hard! The sperm would batter their heads flat against that stony ovum. You sure she's pregnant?</q></p>

<p><q>Your Mama's out there, dressed fit to kill and I wish someone would. Mother Earth headed for the perigee of the gummint store to waste your substance.</q></p>

<p>Grandpa braces himself as if on a rolling deck, the blue-black veins on his legs thick as strangling vines on an ancient oak. <q class="continued">Brief departure from the role of Herr Doktor Sternscheissdreckschnuppe, the great astronomer, to that of der Unterseeboot Kapitan von Schooten die Fischen in der Barrel. Ach! I zee yet das tramp Schteamer, Deine Mama, yawing, pitching, rolling in the seas of alcohol. Compass lost; rhumb dumb. Three sheets to the wind. Paddlewheels spinning in the air. The black gang sweating their balls off, stoking the furnaces of frustration. Propellers tangled in the nets of neurosis. And the Great White Whale a glimmer in the black depths but coming up fast, intent on broaching her bottom, too big to miss. Poor damned vessel, I weep for her. I also vomit with disgust.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Fire one! Fire two! Baroom! Mama rolls over, a jagged hole in her hull but not the one you're thinking of. Down she goes, nose first, as befits a devoted fellationeer, her huge aft rising into the air. Blub, blub! Full fathom five!</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">And so back from undersea to outer space. Your sylvan Mars, Red Hawk, has just stepped out of the tavern. And Luscus, Jupiter, the one-eyed All-Father of Art, if you'll pardon my mixing of Nordic and Latin mythologies, is surrounded by his swarm of satellites.</q></p>

<h3><q>Excretion Is the Bitter Part of Valor</q></h3>

<p>Luscus says to the fido interviewers. <q class="continued">By this I mean that Winnegan, like every artist, great or not, produces art that is, first, secretion, unique to himself, then excretion. Excretion in the original sense of ‘sifting out.’ Creative excretion or discrete excretion. I know that my distinguished colleagues will make fun of this analogy, so I hereby challenge them to a fido debate whenever it can be arranged.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">The valor comes from the courage of the artist in showing his inner products to the public. The bitter part comes from the fact that the artist may be rejected or misunderstood in his time. Also from the terrible war that takes place in the artist with the disconnected or chaotic elements, often contradictory, which he must unite and then mold into a unique entity. Hence my <q>discrete excretion</q> phrase.</q></p>

<p>Fido interviewer: <q>Are we to understand that everything is a big pile of shit but that art makes a strange sea-change, forms it into something golden and illuminating?</q></p>

<p><q>Not exactly. But you're close. I'll elaborate and expound at a later date. At present, I want to talk about Winnegan. Now, the lesser artists give only the surface of things; they are photographers. But the great ones give the interiority of objects and beings. Winnegan, however, is the first to reveal more than one interiority in a single work of art. His invention of the alto-relief multilevel technique enables him to epiphanize—show forth—subterranean layer upon layer.</q></p>

<p>Primalux Ruskinson, loudly, <q>The Great Onion Peeler of Painting!</q></p>

<p>Luscus, calmly after the laughter has died: <q class="continued">In one sense, that is well put. Great art, like an onion, brings tears to the eyes. However, the light on Winnegan's paintings is not just a reflection; it is sucked in, digested, and then fractured forth. Each of the broken beams makes visible, not various aspects of the figures beneath, but whole figures. Worlds, I might say.</q></p>

<p><q>I call this The Pellucidar Breakthrough. Pellucidar is the hollow interior of our planet, as depicted in a now forgotten fantasy-romance of the twentieth-century writer, Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of the immortal Tarzan.</q></p>

<p>Ruskinson moans and feels faint again. <q>Pellucid! Pellucidar! Luscus, you punning exhumist bastard!</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Burroughs’ hero penetrated the crust of Earth to discover another world inside. This was, in some ways, the reverse of the exterior, continents where the surface seas are, and vice versa. Just so, Winnegan has discovered an inner world, the obverse of the public image Everyman projects. And, like Burroughs’ hero, he has returned with a stunning narrative of psychic dangers and exploration.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">And just as the fictional hero found his Pellucidar to be populated with stone-age men and dinosaurs, so Winnegan's world is, though absolutely modern in one sense, archaic in another. Abysmally pristine. Yet, in the illumination of Winnegan's world, there is an evil and inscrutable patch of blackness, and that is paralleled in Pellucidar by the tiny fixed moon which casts a chilling and unmoving shadow.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Now, I did intend that the ordinary ‘pellucid’ should be part of Pellucidar. Yet ‘pellucid’ means ‘reflecting light evenly from all surfaces’ or ‘admitting maximum passage of light without diffusion or distortion.’ Winnegan's paintings do just the opposite. But—under the broken and twisted light, the acute observer can see a primeval luminosity, even and straight. This is the light that links all the fractures and multilevels, the light I was thinking of in my earlier discussion of the ‘Age of the Plugged-In Man’ and the polar bear.</q></p>

<p><q>By intent scrutiny, a viewer may detect this, feel, as it were, the photonic fremitus of the heartbeat of Winnegan's world.</q></p>

<p>Ruskinson almost faints. Luscus’ smile and black monocle make him look like a pirate who has just taken a Spanish galleon loaded with gold.</p>

<p>Grandpa, still at the scope, says, <q>And there's Maryam bint Yusuf, the Egyptian backwoodswoman you were telling me about. Your Saturn, aloof, regal, cold, and wearing one of those suspended whirling manycolored hats that're all the rage. Saturn's rings? Or a halo?</q></p>

<p><q>She's beautiful, and she'd make a wonderful mother for my children,</q> Chib says.</p>

<p><q>The chic of Araby. Your Saturn has two moons, mother and aunt. Chaperones! You say she'd make a good mother! How good a wife! Is she intelligent?</q></p>

<p><q>She's as smart as Benedictine.</q></p>

<p><q>A dumbshit then. You sure can pick them. How do you know you're in love with her? You've been in love with twenty women in the last six months.</q></p>

<p><q>I love her. This is it.</q></p>

<p><q>Until the next one. Can you really love anything but your painting? Benedictine's going to have an abortion, right?</q></p>

<p><q>Not if I can talk her out of it,</q> Chib says. <q>To tell the truth, I don't even like her any more. But she's carrying my child.</q></p>

<p><q>Let me look at your pelvis. No, you're male. For a moment, I wasn't sure, you're so crazy to have a baby.</q></p>

<p><q>A baby is a miracle to stagger sextillions of infidels.</q></p>

<p><q>It beats a mouse. But don't you know that Uncle Sam has been propagandizing his heart out to cut down on propagation? Where've you been all your life?</q></p>

<p><q>I got to go, Grandpa.</q></p>

<p>Chib kisses the old man and returns to his room to finish his latest painting. The door still refuses to recognize him, and he calls the gummint repair shop, only to be told that all technicians are at the Folk Festival. He leaves the house in a red rage. The bunting and balloons are waving and bobbing in the artificial wind, increased for this occasion, and an orchestra is playing by the lake.</p>

<p>Through the scope, Grandpa watches him walk away.</p>

<p><q class="continued">Poor devil! I ache for his ache. He wants a baby, and he is ripped up inside because that poor devil Benedictine is aborting their child. Part of his agony, though he doesn't know it, is identification with the doomed infant. His own mother has had innumerable—well, quite a few—abortions. But for the grace of God, he would have been one of them, another nothingness. He wants this baby to have a chance, too. But there is nothing he can do about it, nothing.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">And there is another feeling, one which he shares with most of humankind. He knows he's screwed up his life, or something has twisted it. Every thinking man and woman knows this. Even the smug and dimwitted realize this unconsciously. But a baby, that beautiful being, that unsmirched blank tablet, unformed angel, represents a new hope. Perhaps it won't screw up. Perhaps it'll grow up to be a healthy confident reasonable good-humored unselfish loving man or woman. ‘It won't be like me or my next-door neighbor,’ the proud, but apprehensive, parent swears.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Chib thinks this and swears that his baby will be different. But, like everybody else, he's fooling himself. A child has one father and mother, but it has trillions of aunts and uncles. Not only those that are its contemporaries; the dead, too. Even if Chib fled into the wilderness and raised the infant himself, he'd be giving it his own unconscious assumptions. The baby would grow up with beliefs and attitudes that the father was not even aware of. Moreover, being raised in isolation, the baby would be a very peculiar human being indeed.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">And if Chib raises the child in this society, it's inevitable that it will accept at least part of the attitudes of its playmates, teachers, and so on ad nauseam.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">So, forget about making a new Adam out of your wonderful potential-teeming child, Chib. If it grows up to become at least half-sane, it's because you gave it love and discipline and it was lucky in its social contacts and it was also blessed at birth with the right combination of genes. That is, your son or daughter is now both a fighter and a lover.</q></p>

<h3><q>One Man's Nightmare Is Another Man's Wet Dream</q></h3>

<p>Grandpa says.</p>

<p><q class="continued">I was talking to Dante Alighieri just the other day, and he was telling me what an inferno of stupidity, cruelty, perversity, atheism, and outright peril the sixteenth century was. The nineteenth left him gibbering, hopelessly searching for adequate enough invectives.</q></p>

<p><q>As for this age, it gave him such high-blood pressure, I had to slip him a tranquilizer and ship him out via time machine with an attendant nurse. She looked much like Beatrice and so should have been just the medicine he needed—maybe.</q></p>

<p>Grandpa chuckles, remembering that Chib, as a child, took him seriously when he described his time-machine visitors, such notables as Nebuchadnezzar, King of the Grass-Eaters; Samson, Bronze Age Riddler and Scourge of the Philistines; Moses, who stole a god from his Kenite father-in-law and who fought against circumcision all his life; Buddha, the Original Beatnik; No-Moss Sisyphus, taking a vacation from his stone-rolling; Androcles and his buddy, the Cowardly Lion of Oz; Baron von Richthofen, the Red Knight of Germany; Beowulf; Al Capone; Hiawatha; Ivan the Terrible; and hundreds of others.</p>

<p>The time came when Grandpa became alarmed and decided that Chib was confusing fantasy with reality. He hated to tell the little boy that he had been making up all those wonderful stories, mostly to teach him history. It was like telling a kid there wasn't any Santa Claus.</p>

<p>And then, while he was reluctantly breaking the news to his grandson, he became aware of Chib's barely suppressed grin and knew that it was his turn to have his leg pulled. Chib had never been fooled or else had caught on without any shock. So, both had a big laugh and Grandpa continued to tell of his visitors.</p>

<p><q>There are no time machines,</q> Grandpa says. <q class="continued">Like it or not, Miniver Cheevy, you have to live in this your time.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">The machines work in the utility-factory levels in a silence broken only by the chatter of a few mahouts. The great pipes at the bottom of the seas suck up water and bottom sludge. The stuff is automatically carried through pipes to the ten production levels of LA. There the inorganic chemicals are converted into energy and then into the matter of food, drink, medicines, and artifacts. There is very little agriculture or animal husbandry outside the city walls, but there is superabundance for all. Artificial but exact duplication of organic stuff, so who knows the difference?</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">There is no more starvation or want anywhere, except among the self-exiles wandering in the woods. And the food and goods are shipped to the pandoras and dispensed to the receivers of the purple wage. <i>The purple wage.</i> A madison-avenue euphemism with connotations of royalty and divine right. Earned by just being born.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Other ages would regard ours as a delirium, yet ours has benefits others lacked. To combat transiency and rootlessness, the megalopolis is compartmented into small communities. A man can live all his life in one place without having to go elsewhere to get anything he needs. With this has come a provincialism, a small-town patriotism and hostility towards outsiders. Hence, the bloody juvenile gang-fights between towns. The intense and vicious gossip. The insistence on conformity to local mores.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">At the same time, the small-town citizen has fido, which enables him to see events anywhere in the world. Intermingled with the trash and the propaganda, which the government thinks is good for the people, is any amount of superb programs. A man may get the equivalent of a Ph.D. without stirring out of his house.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Another Renaissance has come, a fruition of the arts comparable to that of Pericles’ Athens and the city-states of Michelangelo's Italy or Shakespeare's England. Paradox. More illiterates than ever before in the world's history. But also more literates. Speakers of classical Latin outnumber those of Caesar's day. The world of aesthetics bears a fabulous fruit. And, of course, fruits.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">To dilute the provincialism and also to make international war even more unlikely, we have the world policy of <i>homogenization</i>. The voluntary exchange of a part of one nation's population with another's. Hostages to peace and brotherly love. Those citizens who can't get along on just the purple wage or who think they'll be happier elsewhere are induced to emigrate with bribes.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">A Golden World in some respects; a nightmare in others. So what's new with the world? It was always thus in every age. Ours has had to deal with overpopulation and automation. How else could the problem be solved? It's Buridan's ass (actually, the ass was a dog) all over again, as in every time. Buridan's ass, dying of hunger because it can't make up its mind which of two equal amounts of food to eat.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">History: a <i>pons asinorum</i> with men the asses on the bridge of time.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">No, those two comparisons are not fair or right. It's Hobson's horse, the only choice being the beast in the nearest stall. Zeitgeist rides tonight, and the devil take the hindmost!</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">The mid-twentieth-century writers of the Triple Revolution document forecast accurately in some respects. But they de-emphasized what lack of work would do to Mr. Everyman. They believed that all men have equal potentialities in developing artistic tendencies, that all could busy themselves with arts, crafts, and hobbies or education for education's sake. They wouldn't face the ‘undemocratic’ reality that only about ten per cent of the population—if that—are inherently capable of producing anything worth while, or even mildly interesting, in the arts. Crafts, hobbies, and a lifelong academic education pale after a while, so back to the booze, fido, and adultery.</q></p>

<p><q>Lacking self-respect, the fathers become free-floaters, nomads on the steppes of sex. Mother, with a capital M, becomes the dominant figure in the family. She may be playing around, too, but she's taking care of the kids; she's around most of the time. Thus, with father a lower-case figure, absent, weak, or indifferent, the children often become homosexual or ambisexual. The wonderland is also a fairyland.</q></p>

<p><q>Some features of this time could have been predicted. Sexual permissiveness was one, although no one could have seen how far it would go. But then no one could have foreknown of the Panamorite sect, even if America has spawned lunatic-fringe cults as a frog spawns tadpoles. Yesterday's monomaniac is tomorrow's messiah, and so Sheltey and his disciples survived through years of persecution and today their precepts are embedded in our culture.</q></p>

<p>Grandpa again fixes the cross-reticules of the scope on Chib.</p>

<p><q class="continued">There he goes, my beautiful grandson, bearing gifts to the Greeks. So far, that Hercules has failed to clean up his psychic Augean stable. Yet, he may succeed, that stumblebum Apollo, that Edipus Wrecked. He's luckier than most of his contemporaries. He's had a permanent father, even if a secret one, a zany old man hiding from so-called justice. He has gotten love, discipline, and a superb education in this starred chamber. He's also fortunate in having a profession.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">But Mama spends far too much and also is addicted to gambling, a vice which deprives her of her full guaranteed income. I'm supposed to be dead, so I don't get the purple wage. Chib has to make up for all this by selling or trading his paintings. Luscus has helped him by publicizing him, but at any moment Luscus may turn against him. The money from the paintings is still not enough. After all, money is not the basic of our economy; it's a scarce auxiliary. Chib needs the grant but won't get it unless he lets Luscus make love to him.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">It's not that Chib rejects homosexual relations. Like most of his contemporaries, he's sexually ambivalent. I think that he and Omar Runic still blow each other occasionally. And why not? They love each other. But Chib rejects Luscus as a matter of principle. He won't be a whore to advance his career. Moreover, Chib makes a distinction which is deeply embedded in this society. He thinks that uncompulsive homosexuality is natural (whatever that means?) but that compulsive homosexuality is, to use an old term, queer. Valid or not, the distinction is made.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">So, Chib may go to Egypt. But what happens to me then?</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Never mind me or your mother, Chib. No matter what. Don't give in to Luscus. Remember the dying words of Singleton, Bureau of Relocation and Rehabilitation Director, who shot himself because he couldn't adjust to the new times.</q></p>

<p><q><q>What if a man gain the world and lose his ass?</q></q></p>

<p>At this moment, Grandpa sees his grandson, who has been walking along with somewhat drooping shoulders, suddenly straighten them. And he sees Chib break into a dance, a little improvised shuffle followed by a series of whirls. It is evident that Chib is whooping. The pedestrians around him are grinning.</p>

<p>Grandpa groans and then laughs. <q>Oh, God, the goatish energy of youth, the unpredictable shift of spectrum from black sorrow to bright orange joy! Dance, Chib, dance your crazy head off! Be happy, if only for a moment! You're young yet, you've got the bubbling of unconquerable hope deep in your springs! Dance, Chib, dance!</q></p>

<p>He laughs and wipes a tear away.</p>

<h3>Sexual Implications of the Charge of the Light Brigade</h3>

<p>is so fascinating a book that Doctor Jespersen Joyce Bathymens, psycholinguist for the federal Bureau of Group Reconfiguration and Intercommunicability, hates to stop reading. But duty beckons.</p>

<p><q>A radish is not necessarily reddish,</q> he says into the recorder. <q class="continued">The Young Radishes so named their group because a radish is a radicle, hence, radical. Also, there's a play on roots and on red-ass, a slang term for anger, and possibly on ruttish and rattish. And undoubtedly on rude-ickle, Beverly Hills dialectical term for a repulsive, unruly, and socially ungraceful person.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Yet the Young Radishes are not what I would call Left Wing; they represent the current resentment against Life-In-General and advocate no radical policy of reconstruction. They howl against Things As They Are, like monkeys in a tree, but never give constructive criticism. They want to destroy without any thought of what to do after the destruction.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">In short, they represent the average citizen's grousing and bitching, being different in that they are more articulate. There are thousands of groups like them in LA and possibly millions all over the world. They had normal life as children. In fact, they were born and raised in the same clutch, which is one reason why they were chosen for this study. What phenomenon produced ten such creative persons, all mothered in the seven houses of Area 69-14, all about the same time, all practically raised together, since they were put together in the playpen on top of the pedestal while one mother took her turn baby-sitting and the others did whatever they had to do, which &hellip; where was I?</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Oh, yes, they had a normal life, went to the same school, palled around, enjoyed the usual sexual play among themselves, joined the juvenile gangs and engaged in some rather bloody warfare with the Westwood and other gangs. All were distinguished, however, by an intense intellectual curiosity and all become active in the creative arts.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">It has been suggested—and might be true—that that mysterious stranger, Raleigh Renaissance, was the father of all ten. This is possible but can't be proved. Raleigh Renaissance was living in the house of Mrs. Winnegan at the time, but he seems to have been unusually active in the clutch and, indeed, all over Beverly Hills. Where this man came from, who he was, and where he went are still unknown despite intensive search by various agencies. He had no ID or other cards of any kind, yet he went unchallenged for a long time. He seems to have had something on the Chief of Police of Beverly Hills and possibly on some of the Federal agents stationed in Beverly Hills.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">He lived for two years with Mrs. Winnegan, then dropped out of sight. It is rumored that he left LA to join a tribe of white neo-Amerinds, sometimes called the Seminal Indians.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Anyway, back to the Young (pun on Jung?) Radishes. They are revolting against the Father Image of Uncle Sam, whom they both love and hate. Uncle is, of course, linked by their subconsciouses with <i>unco</i>, a Scottish word meaning strange, uncanny, weird, this indicating that their own fathers were strangers to them. All come from homes where the father was missing or weak, a phenomenon regrettably common in our culture.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">I never knew my own father &hellip; Tooney, wipe that out as irrelevant. <i>Unco</i> also means news or tidings, indicating that the unfortunate young men are eagerly awaiting news of the return of their fathers and perhaps secretly hoping for reconciliation with Uncle Sam, that is, their fathers.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Uncle Sam. Sam is short for Samuel, from the Hebrew <i>Shemu'el</i>, meaning Name of God. All the Radishes are atheists, although some, notably Omar Runic and Chibiabos Winnegan, were given religious instruction as children (Panamorite and Roman Catholic, respectively).</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Young Winnegan's revolt against God, and against the Catholic Church, was undoubtedly reinforced by the fact that his mother forced strong <i>cath</i>artics upon him when he had a chronic constipation. He probably also resented having to learn his <i>cat</i>echism when he preferred to play. And there is the deeply significant and traumatic incident in which a <i>cath</i>eter was used on him. (This refusal to excrete when young will be analyzed in a later report.)</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Uncle Sam, the Father Figure. <i>Figure</i> is so obvious a play that I won't bother to point it out. Also perhaps on <i>figger</i>, in the sense of ‘a fig on thee!'—look this up in Dante's <i>Inferno</i>, some Italian or other in Hell said, ‘A fig on thee, God!’ biting his thumb in the ancient gesture of defiance and disrespect. Hmm? Biting the thumb—an infantile characteristic?</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Sam is also a multileveled pun on phonetically, orthographically, and semisemantically linked words. It is significant that young Winnegan can't stand to be called <i>dear</i>; he claims that his mother called him that so many times it nauseates him. Yet the word has a deeper meaning to him. For instance, <i>sambar</i> is an Asiatic <i>deer</i> with <i>three</i>-pointed antlers. (Note the <i>sam</i>, also.) Obviously, the three points symbolize, to him, the Triple Revolution document, the historic dating point of the beginning of our era, which Chib claims to hate so. The three points are also archetypes of the Holy Trinity, which the Young Radishes frequently blaspheme against.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">I might point out that in this the group differs from others I've studied. The others expressed an infrequent and mild blasphemy in keeping with the mild, indeed pale, religious spirit prevalent nowadays. Strong blasphemers thrive only when strong believers thrive.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Sam also stands for <i>same</i>, indicating the Radishes’ subconscious desire to conform.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Possibly, although this particular analysis may be invalid, Sam corresponds to Samekh, the fifteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. (Sam! Ech!?) In the old style of English spelling, which the Radishes learned in their childhood, the fifteenth letter of the Roman alphabet is O. In the Alphabet Table of my dictionary, Webster's 128th New Collegiate, the Roman O is in the same horizontal column as the Arabic Dad. Also with the Hebrew Mem. So we get a double connection with the missing and longed-for Father (or Dad) and with the overdominating Mother (or Mem).</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">I can make nothing out of the Greek Omicron, also in the same horizontal column. But give me time; this takes study.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Omicron. The little O! The lower-case omicron has an egg shape. The little egg is their father's sperm fertilized? The womb? The basic shape of modern architecture?</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Sam Hill, an archaic euphemism for Hell. Uncle Sam is a Sam Hill of a father? Better strike that out, Tooney. It's possible that these highly educated youths have read about this obsolete phrase, but it's not confirmable. I don't want to suggest any connections that might make me look ridiculous.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Let's see. Samisen. A Japanese musical instrument with <i>three</i> strings. The Triple Revolution document and the Trinity again. Trinity? Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Mother the thoroughly despised figure, hence, the Wholly Goose? Well, maybe not. Wipe that out, Tooney.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Samisen. Son of Sam? Which leads naturally to Samson, who pulled down the temple of the Philistines on them and on himself. These boys talk of doing the same thing. Chuckle. Reminds me of myself when I was their age, before I matured. Strike out that last remark, Tooney.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Samovar. The Russian word means, literally, self-boiler. There's no doubt the Radishes are boiling with revolutionary fervor. Yet their disturbed psyches know, deep down, that Uncle Sam is their ever-loving Father-Mother, that he has only their best interests at heart. But they force themselves to hate him, hence, they self-boil.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">A samlet is a young salmon. Cooked salmon is a yellowish pink or pale red, near to a radish in color, in their unconsciouses, anyway. Samlet equals Young Radish; they feel they're being cooked in the great pressure cooker of modern society.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">How's that for a trinely furned phase—I mean, finely turned phrase, Tooney? Run this off, edit as indicated, smooth it out, you know how, and send it off to the boss. I got to go. I'm late for lunch with Mother; she gets very upset if I'm not there on the dot.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, postscript! I recommend that the agents watch Winnegan more closely. His friends are blowing off psychic steam through talk and drink, but he has suddenly altered his behavior pattern. He has long periods of silence, he's given up smoking, drinking, and sex.</q></p>

<h3>A Profit Is Not Without Honor</h3>

<p>even in this day. The gummint has no overt objection to privately owned taverns, run by citizens who have paid all license fees, passed all examinations, posted all bonds, and bribed the local politicians and police chief. Since there is no provision made for them, no large buildings available for rent, the taverns are in the homes of the owners themselves.</p>

<p><i>The Private Universe</i> is Chib's favorite, partly because the proprietor is operating illegally. Dionysus Gobrinus, unable to hew his way through the roadblocks, prise-de-chevaux, barbed wire, and booby-traps of official procedure, has quit his efforts to get a license.</p>

<p>Openly, he paints the name of his establishment over the mathematical equations that once distinguished the exterior of the house. (Math prof at Beverly Hills U. 14, named Al-Khwarizmi Descartes Lobachevsky, he has resigned and changed his name again.) The atrium and several bedrooms have been converted for drinking and carousing. There are no Egyptian customers, probably because of their supersensitivity about the flowery sentiments painted by patrons on the inside walls.</p>

<p>À BAS, ABU</p>

<p>MOHAMMED WAS THE SON OF A VIRGIN DOG</p>

<p>THE SPHINX STINKS</p>

<p>REMEMBER THE RED SEA!</p>

<p>THE PROPHET HAS A CAMEL FETISH</p>

<p>Some of those who wrote the taunts have fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers who were themselves the objects of similar insults. But their descendants are thoroughly assimilated, Beverly Hillsians to the core. Of such is the kingdom of men.</p>

<p>Gobrinus, a squat cube of a man, stands behind the bar, which is square as a protest against the ovoid. Above him is a big sign:</p>

<h3>One Man's Mead Is Another Man's Poisson</h3>

<p>Gobrinus has explained this pun many times, not always to his listener's satisfaction. Suffice it that Poisson was a mathematician and that Poisson's frequency distribution is a good approximation to the binomial distribution as the number of trials increases and probability of success in a single trial is small.</p>

<p>When a customer gets too drunk to be permitted one more drink, he is hurled headlong from the tavern with furious combustion and utter ruin by Gobrinus, who cries, <q>Poisson! Poisson!</q></p>

<p>Chib's friends, the Young Radishes, sitting at a hexagonal table, greet him, and their words unconsciously echo those of the Federal psycholinguist's estimate of his recent behavior.</p>

<p><q>Chib, monk! Chibber as ever! Looking for a chibbie, no doubt! Take your pick!</q></p>

<p>Madame Trismegista, sitting at a little table with a Seal-of-Solomon-shape top, greets him. She has been Gobrinus’ wife for two years, a record, because she will knife him if he leaves her. Also, he believes that she can somehow juggle his destiny with the cards she deals. In this age of enlightenment, the soothsayer and astrologer flourish. As science pushes forward, ignorance and superstition gallop around the flanks and bite science in the rear with big dark teeth.</p>

<p>Gobrinus himself, a Ph.D., holder of the torch of knowledge (until lately, anyway), does not believe in God. But he is sure the stars are marching towards a baleful conjunction for him. With a strange logic, he thinks that his wife's cards control the stars; he is unaware that card-divination and astrology are entirely separate fields.</p>

<p>What can you expect of a man who claims that the universe is asymmetric?</p>

<p>Chib waves his hand at Madame Trismegista and walks to another table. Here sits</p>

<h3>A Typical Teemager</h3>

<p>Benedictine Serinus Melba. She is tall and slim and has narrow lemurlike hips and slender legs but big breasts. Her hair, black as the pupils of her eyes, is parted in the middle, plastered with perfumed spray to the skull, and braided into two long pigtails. These are brought over her bare shoulders and held together with a golden brooch just below her throat. From the brooch, which is in the form of a musical note, the braids part again, one looping under each breast. Another brooch secures them, and they separate to circle around behind her back, are brooched again, and come back to meet on her belly. Another brooch holds them, and the twin waterfalls flow blackly over the front of her bell-shaped skirt.</p>

<p>Her face is thickly farded with green, aquamarine, a shamrock beauty mark, and topaz. She wears a yellow bra with artificial pink nipples; frilly lace ribbons hang from the bra. A demicorselet of bright green with black rosettes circles her waist. Over the corselet, half-concealing it, is a wire structure covered with a shimmering pink quilty material. It extends out in back to form a semifuselage or a bird's long tail, to which are attached long yellow and crimson artificial feathers.</p>

<p>An ankle-length diaphanous skirt billows out. It does not hide the yellow and dark-green striped lace-fringed garter-panties, white thighs, and black net stockings with green clocks in the shape of musical notes. Her shoes are bright blue with topaz high heels.</p>

<p>Benedictine is costumed to sing at the Folk Festival; the only thing missing is her singer's hat. Yet, she came to complain, among other things, that Chib has forced her to cancel her appearance and so lose her chance at a great career.</p>

<p>She is with five girls, all between sixteen and twenty-one, all drinking P (for popskull).</p>

<p><q>Can't we talk in private, Benny?</q> Chib says.</p>

<p><q>What for?</q> Her voice is a lovely contralto ugly with inflection.</p>

<p><q>You got me down here to make a public scene,</q> Chib says.</p>

<p><q>For God's sake, what other kind of scene is there?</q> she shrills. <q>Look at him! He wants to talk to me alone!</q></p>

<p>It is then that he realizes she is afraid to be alone with him. More than that, she is incapable of being alone. Now he knows why she insisted on leaving the bedroom door open with her girl-friend, Bela, within calling distance. And listening distance.</p>

<p><q>You said you was just going to use your finger!</q> she shouts. She points at the slightly rounded belly. <q>I'm going to have a baby! You rotten smooth-talking sick bastard!</q></p>

<p><q>That isn't true at all,</q> Chib says. <q>You told me it was all right, you loved me.</q></p>

<p><q>'Love! Love!’ he says! What the hell do I know what I said, you got me so excited! Anyway, I didn't say you could stick it in! I'd never say that, never! And then what you <i>did! What</i> you did! My God, I could hardly walk for a week, you bastard, you!</q></p>

<p>Chib sweats. Except for Beethoven's Pastoral welling from the fido, the room is silent. His friends grin. Gobrinus, his back turned, is drinking scotch. Madame Trismegista shuffles her cards, and she farts with a fiery conjunction of beer and onions. Benedictine's friends look at their Mandarin-long fluorescent fingernails or glare at him. Her hurt and indignity is theirs and vice versa.</p>

<p><q>I can't take those pills. They make me break out and give me eye trouble and screw up my monthlies! You know that! And I can't stand those mechanical uteruses! And you lied to me, anyway! You said you took a pill!</q></p>

<p>Chib realizes she's contradicting herself, but there's no use trying to be logical. She's furious because she's pregnant; she doesn't want to be inconvenienced with an abortion at this time, and she's out for revenge.</p>

<p>Now how, Chib wonders, how could she get pregnant <i>that</i> night? No woman, no matter how fertile, could have managed that. She must have been knocked up before or after. Yet she swears that it was that night, the night he was</p>

<h3>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</h3>

<p class="center">or</p>

<h3>Foam, Foam On the Range</h3>

<p><q>No, no!</q> Benedictine cries.</p>

<p><q>Why not? I love you,</q> Chib says. <q>I want to marry you.</q></p>

<p>Benedictine screams, and her friend Bela, out in the hall, yells, <q>What's the matter? What happened?</q></p>

<p>Benedictine does not reply. Raging, shaking as if in the grip of a fever, she scrambles out of bed, pushing Chib to one side. She runs to the small egg of the bathroom in the corner, and he follows her.</p>

<p><q>I hope you're not going to do what I think&hellip;?</q> he says.</p>

<p>Benedictine moans, <q>You sneaky no-good son of a bitch!</q></p>

<p>In the bathroom, she pulls down a section of wall, which becomes a shelf. On its top, attached by magnetic bottoms to the shelf, are many containers. She seizes a long thin can of spermatocide, squats, and inserts it. She presses the button on its bottom, and it foams with a hissing sound even its cover of flesh cannot silence.</p>

<p>Chib is paralyzed for a moment. Then he roars.</p>

<p>Benedictine shouts, <q>Stay away from me, you rude-ickle!</q></p>

<p>From the door to the bedroom comes Bela's timid, <q>Are you all right, Benny?</q></p>

<p><q>I'll all-right her!</q> Chib bellows.</p>

<p>He jumps forward and takes a can of tempoxy glue from the shelf. The glue is used by Benedictine to attach her wigs to her head and will hold anything forever unless softened by a specific defixative.</p>

<p>Benedictine and Bela both cry out as Chib lifts Benedictine up and then lowers her to the floor. She fights, but he manages to spray the glue over the can and the skin and hairs around it.</p>

<p><q>What're you doing?</q> she screams.</p>

<p>He pushes the button on the bottom of the can to full-on position and then sprays the bottom with glue. While she struggles, he holds her arms tight against her body and keeps her from rolling over and so moving the can in or out. Silently, Chib counts to thirty, then to thirty more to make sure the glue is thoroughly dried. He releases her.</p>

<p>The foam is billowing out around her groin and down her legs and spreading out across the floor. The fluid in the can is under enormous pressure in the indestructible unpunchable can, and the foam expands vastly if exposed to open air.</p>

<p>Chib takes the can of defixative from the shelf and clutches it in his hand, determined that she will not have it. Benedictine jumps up and swings at him. Laughing like a hyena in a tentful of nitrous oxide, Chib blocks her fist and shoves her away. Slipping on the foam, which is ankle-keep by now, Benedictine falls and then slides backward out of the bedroom on her buttocks, the can clunking.</p>

<p>She gets to her feet and only then realizes fully what Chib has done. Her scream goes up, and she follows it. She dances around, yanking at the can, her screams intensifying with every tug and resultant pain. Then she turns and runs out of the room or tries to. She skids; Bela is in her way; they cling together and both ski out of the room, doing a half-turn while going through the door. The foam swirls out so that the two look like Venus and friend rising from the bubble-capped waves of the Cyprian Sea.</p>

<p>Benedictine shoves Bela away but not without losing some flesh to Bela's long sharp fingernails. Bela shoots backwards through the door toward Chib. She is like a novice ice skater trying to maintain her balance. She does not succeed and shoots by Chib, wailing, on her back, her feet up in the air.</p>

<p>Chib slides his bare feet across the floor gingerly, stops at the bed to pick up his clothes, but decides he'd be wiser to wait until he's outside before he puts them on. He gets to the circular hall just in time to see Benedictine crawling past one of the columns that divides the corridor from the atrium. Her parents, two middle-aged behemoths, are still sitting on a flato, beer cans in hand, eyes wide, mouths open, quivering.</p>

<p>Chib does not even say goodnight to them as he passes along the hall. But then he sees the fido and realizes that her parents had switched it from EXT. to INT. and then to Benedictine's room. Father and mother have been watching Chib and daughter, and it is evident from father's not-quite dwindled condition that father was very excited by this show, superior to anything seen on exterior fido.</p>

<p><q>You peeping bastards!</q> Chib roars.</p>

<p>Benedictine has gotten to them and on her feet and she is stammering, weeping, indicating the can and then stabbing her finger at Chib. At Chib's roar, the parents heave up from the flato as two leviathans from the deep. Benedictine turns and starts to run towards him, her arms outstretched, her long-nailed fingers curved, her face a medusa's. Behind her streams the wake of the livid witch and father and mother on the foam.</p>

<p>Chib shoves up against a pillar and rebounds and skitters off, helpless to keep himself from turning sidewise during the maneuver. But he keeps his balance. Mama and Papa have gone down together with a crash that shakes even the solid house. They are up, eyes rolling and bellowing like hippos surfacing. They charge him but separate, Mama shrieking now, her face, despite the fat, Benedictine's. Papa goes around one side of the pillar; Mama, the other. Benedictine has rounded another pillar, holding to it with one hand to keep her from slipping. She is between Chib and the door to the outside.</p>

<p>Chib slams against the wall of the corridor, in an area free of foam. Benedictine runs towards him. He dives across the floor, hits it, and rolls between two pillars and out into the atrium.</p>

<p>Mama and Papa converge in a collision course. The Titanic meets the iceberg, and both plunge swiftly. They skid on their faces and bellies towards Benedictine. She leaps into the air, trailing foam on them as they pass beneath her.</p>

<p>By now it is evident that the government's claim that the can is good for 40,000 shots of death-to-sperm, or for 40,000 copulations, is justified. Foam is all over the place, ankle-deep—knee-high in some places—and still pouring out.</p>

<p>Bela is on her back now and on the atrium floor, her head driven into the soft folds of the flato.</p>

<p>Chib gets up slowly and stands for a moment, glaring around him, his knees bent, ready to jump from danger but hoping he won't have to since his feet will undoubtedly fly away from under him.</p>

<p><q>Hold it, you rotten son of a bitch!</q> Papa roars. <q>I'm going to kill you! You can't do this to my daughter!</q></p>

<p>Chib watches him turn over like a whale in a heavy sea and try to get to his feet. Down he goes again, grunting as if hit by a harpoon. Mama is no more successful than he.</p>

<p>Seeing that his way is unbarred—Benedictine having disappeared somewhere—Chib skis across the atrium until he reaches an unfoamed area near the exit. Clothes over his arm, still holding the defixative, he struts towards the door.</p>

<p>At this moment Benedictine calls his name. He turns to see her sliding from the kitchen at him. In her hand is a tall glass. He wonders what she intends to do with it. Certainly, she is not offering him the hospitality of a drink.</p>

<p>Then she scoots into the dry region of the floor and topples forward with a scream. Nevertheless, she throws the contents of the glass accurately.</p>

<p>Chib screams when he feels the boiling hot water, painful as if he had been circumcised unanesthetized.</p>

<p>Benedictine, on the floor, laughs. Chib, after jumping around and shrieking, the can and clothes dropped, his hands holding the scalded parts, manages to control himself. He stops his antics, seizes Benedictine's right hand, and drags her out into the streets of Beverly Hills. There are quite a few people out this night, and they follow the two. Not until Chib reaches the lake does he stop and there he goes into the water to cool off the burn, Benedictine with him.</p>

<p>The crowd has much to talk about later, after Benedictine and Chib have crawled out of the lake and then run home. The crowd talks and laughs quite a while as they watch the sanitation department people clean the foam off the lake surface and the streets.</p>

<p><q>I was so sore I couldn't walk for a month!</q> Benedictine screams.</p>

<p><q>You had it coming,</q> Chib says. <q>You've got no complaints. You said you wanted my baby, and you talked as if you meant it.</q></p>

<p><q>I must've been out of my mind!</q> Benedictine says. <q>No, I wasn't! I never said no such thing! You lied to me! You forced me!</q></p>

<p><q>I would never force anybody,</q> Chib said. <q>You know that. Quit your bitching. You're a free agent, and you consented freely. You have free will.</q></p>

<p>Omar Runic, the poet, stands up from his chair. He is a tall thin red-bronze youth with an aquiline nose and very thick red lips. His kinky hair grows long and is cut into the shape of the <i>Pequod</i>, that fabled vessel which bore mad Captain Ahab and his mad crew and the sole survivor Ishmael after the white whale. The coiffure is formed with a bowsprit and hull and three masts and yardarms and even a boat hanging on davits.</p>

<p>Omar Runic claps his hands and shouts, <q>Bravo! A philosopher! Free will it is; free will to seek the Eternal Verities—if any—or Death and Damnation! I'll drink to free will! A toast, gentlemen! Stand up, Young Radishes, a toast to our leader!</q></p>

<p>And so begins</p>

<h3>The Mad P Party</h3>

<p>Madame Trismegista calls, <q>Tell your fortune, Chib! See what the stars tell through the cards!</q></p>

<p>He sits down at her table while his friends crowd around.</p>

<p><q>O.K., Madame. How do I get out of this mess?</q></p>

<p>She shuffles and turns over the top card.</p>

<p><q>Jesus! The ace of spades!</q></p>

<p><q>You're going on a long journey!</q></p>

<p><q>Egypt!</q> Rousseau Red Hawk cries. <q>Oh, no, you don't want to go there, Chib! Come with me to where the buffalo roam and&hellip;</q></p>

<p>Up comes another card.</p>

<p><q>You will soon meet a beautiful dark lady.</q></p>

<p><q>A goddam Arab! Oh, no, Chib, tell me it's not true!</q></p>

<p><q>You will win great honors soon.</q></p>

<p><q>Chib's going to get the grant!</q></p>

<p><q>If I get the grant, I don't have to go to Egypt,</q> Chib says. <q>Madame Trismegista, with all due respect, you're full of crap.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't mock, young man. I'm not a computer. I'm tuned to the spectrum of psychic vibrations.</q></p>

<p>Flip. <q>You will be in great danger, physically and morally.</q></p>

<p>Chib says, <q>That happens at least once a day.</q></p>

<p>Flip. <q>A man very close to you will die twice.</q></p>

<p>Chib pales, rallies, and says, <q>A coward dies a thousand deaths.</q></p>

<p><q>You will travel in time, return to the past.</q></p>

<p><q>Zow!</q> Red Hawk says. <q>You're outdoing yourself, Madame. Careful! You'll get a psychic hernia, have to wear an ectoplasmic truss!</q></p>

<p><q>Scoff if you want to, you dumbshits,</q> Madame says. <q>There are more worlds than one. The cards don't lie, not when I deal them.</q></p>

<p><q>Gobrinus!</q> Chib calls. <q>Another pitcher of beer for the Madame.</q></p>

<p>The Young Radishes return to their table, a legless disc held up in the air by a graviton field. Benedictine glares at them and goes into a huddle with the other teemagers. At a table nearby sits Pinkerton Legrand, a gummint agent, facing them so that the fido under his one-way window of a jacket beams in on them. They know he's doing this. He knows they know and has reported so to his superior. He frowns when he sees Falco Accipiter enter. Legrand does not like an agent from another department messing around on his case. Accipiter does not even look at Legrand. He orders a pot of tea and then pretends to drop into the teapot a pill that combines with tannic acid to become P.</p>

<p>Rousseau Red Hawk winks at Chib and says, <q>Do you really think it's possible to paralyze all of LA with a single bomb?</q></p>

<p><q>Three bombs!</q> Chib says loudly so that Legrand's fido will pick up the words. <q>One for the control console of the desalinization plant, a second for the backup console, the third for the nexus of the big pipe that carries the water to the reservoir on the 20th level.</q></p>

<p>Pinkerton Legrand turns pale. He downs all the whiskey in his glass and orders another, although he has already had too many. He presses the plate on his fido to transmit a triple top-priority. Lights blink redly in HQ; a gong clangs repeatedly; the chief wakes up so suddenly he falls off his chair.</p>

<p>Accipiter also hears, but he sits stiff, dark, and brooding as the diorite image of a Pharaoh's falcon. Monomaniac, he is not to be diverted by talk of inundating all LA, even if it will lead to action. On Grandpa's trail, he is now here because he hopes to use Chib as the key to the house. One <q>mouse</q>—as he thinks of his criminals—one <q>mouse</q> will run to the hole of another.</p>

<p><q>When do you think we can go into action?</q> Huga Wells-Erb Heinsturbury, the science-fiction authoress, says.</p>

<p><q>In about three weeks,</q> Chib says.</p>

<p>At HQ, the chief curses Legrand for disturbing him. There are thousands of young men and women blowing off steam with these plots of destruction, assassination, and revolt. He does not understand why the young punks talk like this, since they have everything handed them free. If he had his way, he'd throw them into jail and kick them around a little or more than.</p>

<p><q>After we do it, we'll have to take off for the big outdoors,</q> Red Hawk says. His eyes glisten. <q>I'm telling you, boys, being a free man in the forest is the greatest. You're a genuine individual, not just one of the faceless breed.</q></p>

<p>Red Hawk believes in this plot to destroy LA. He is happy because, though he hasn't said so, he has grieved while in Mother Nature's lap for intellectual companionship. The other savages can hear a deer at a hundred yards, detect a rattlesnake in the bushes, but they're deaf to the footfalls of philosophy, the neigh of Nietzsche, the rattle of Russell, the honkings of Hegel.</p>

<p><q>The illiterate swine!</q> he says aloud. The others say, <q>What?</q></p>

<p><q>Nothing. Listen, you guys must know how wonderful it is. You were in the WNRCC.</q></p>

<p><q>I was 4-F,</q> Omar Runic says. <q>I got hay fever.</q></p>

<p><q>I was working on my second M.A.,</q> Gibbon Tacitus says.</p>

<p><q>I was in the WNRCC band,</q> Sibelius Amadeus Yehudi says. <q>We only got outside when we played the camps, and that wasn't often.</q></p>

<p><q>Chib, you were in the Corps. You loved it, didn't you?</q></p>

<p>Chib nods but says, <q>Being a neo-Amerind takes all your time just to survive. When could I paint? And who would see the paintings if I did get time? Anyway, that's no life for a woman or a baby.</q></p>

<p>Red Hawk looks hurt and orders a whiskey mixed with P.</p>

<p>Pinkerton Legrand doesn't want to interrupt his monitoring, yet he can't stand the pressure in his bladder. He walks towards the room used as the customers’ catch-all. Red Hawk, in a nasty mood caused by rejection, sticks his leg out. Legrand trips, catches himself, and stumbles forward. Benedictine puts out her leg. Legrand falls on his face. He no longer has any reason to go to the urinal except to wash himself off.</p>

<p>Everybody except Legrand and Accipiter laugh. Legrand jumps up, his fists doubled. Benedictine ignores him and walks over to Chib, her friends following. Chib stiffens. She says, <q>You perverted bastard! You told me you were just going to use your finger!</q></p>

<p><q>You're repeating yourself,</q> Chib says. <q>The important thing is, what's going to happen to the baby?</q></p>

<p><q>What do you care?</q> Benedictine says. <q>For all you know, it might not even be yours!</q></p>

<p><q>That'd be a relief,</q> Chib says, <q>if it weren't. Even so, the baby should have a say in this. He might want to live—even with you as his mother.</q></p>

<p><q>In this miserable life!</q> she cries. <q>I'm going to do it a favor. I'm going to the hospital and get rid of it. Because of you, I have to miss out on my big chance at the Folk Festival! There'll be agents from all over there, and I won't get a chance to sing for them!</q></p>

<p><q>You're a liar,</q> Chib says. <q>You're all dressed up to sing.</q></p>

<p>Benedictine's face is red; her eyes, wide; her nostrils, flaring.</p>

<p><q>You spoiled my fun!</q></p>

<p>She shouts, <q>Hey, everybody, want to hear a howler! This great artist, this big hunk of manhood, Chib the divine, he can't get a hardon unless he's gone down on!</q></p>

<p>Chib's friends look at each other. What's the bitch screaming about? So what's new?</p>

<p>From Grandpa's <cite>Private Ejaculations</cite>: Some of the features of the Panamorite religion, so reviled and loathed in the 21st century, have become everyday facts in modern times. Love, love, love, physical and spiritual! It's not enough to just kiss your children and hug them. But oral stimulation of the genitals of infants by the parents and relatives has resulted in some curious conditioned reflexes. I could write a book about this aspect of mid-22nd century life and probably will.</p>

<p>Legrand comes out of the washroom. Benedictine slaps Chib's face. Chib slaps her back. Gobrinus lifts up a section of the bar and hurtles through the opening, crying, <q>Poisson! Poisson!</q></p>

<p>He collides with Legrand, who lurches into Bela, who screams, whirls, and slaps Legrand, who slaps back. Benedictine empties a glass of P in Chib's face. Howling, he jumps up and swings his fist. Benedictine ducks, and the fist goes over her shoulder into a girlfriend's chest.</p>

<p>Red Hawk leaps up on the table and shouts, <q>I'm a regular bearcat, half-alligator, half&hellip;</q></p>

<p>The table, held up in a graviton field, can't bear much weight. It tilts and catapults him into the girls, and all go down. They bite and scratch Red Hawk, and Benedictine squeezes his testicles. He screams, writhes, and hurls Benedictine with his feet onto the top of the table. It has regained its normal height and altitude, but now it flips over again, tossing her to the other side. Legrand, tippytoeing through the crowd on his way to the exit, is knocked down. He loses some front teeth against somebody's knee cap. Spitting blood and teeth, he jumps up and slugs a bystander.</p>

<p>Gobrinus fires off a gun that shoots a tiny Very light. It's supposed to blind the brawlers and so bring them to their senses while they're regaining their sight. It hangs in the air and shines like</p>

<h3>A Star Over Bedlam</h3>

<p>The Police Chief is talking via fido to a man in a public booth. The man has turned off the video and is disguising his voice.</p>

<p><q>They're beating the shit out of each other in <i>The Private Universe</i>.</q></p>

<p>The Chief groans. The Festival has just begun, and They are at it already.</p>

<p><q>Thanks. The boys'll be on the way. What's your name? I'd like to recommend you for a Citizen's Medal.</q></p>

<p><q>What! And get the shit knocked out of me, too! I ain't no stoolie; just doing my duty. Besides, I don't like Gobrinus or his customers. They're a bunch of snobs.</q></p>

<p>The Chief issues orders to the riot squad, leans back, and drinks a beer while he watches the operation on fido. What's the matter with these people, anyway? They're always mad about something.</p>

<p>The sirens scream. Although the bolgani ride electrically driven noiseless tricycles, they're still clinging to the centuries-old tradition of warning the criminals that they're coming. Five trikes pull up before the open door of The Private Universe. The police dismount and confer. Their two-storied cylindrical helmets are black and have scarlet roaches. They wear goggles for some reason although their vehicles can't go over 15 m.p.h. Their jackets are black and fuzzy, like a teddy bear's fur, and huge golden epaulets decorate their shoulders. The shorts are electric-blue and fuzzy; the jackboots, glossy black. They carry electric shock sticks and guns that fire chokegas pellets.</p>

<p>Gobrinus blocks the entrance. Sergeant O'Hara says, <q>Come on, let us in. No, I don't have a warrant of entry. But I'll get one.</q></p>

<p><q>If you do, I'll sue,</q> Gobrinus says. He smiles. While it is true that government red tape was so tangled he quit trying to acquire a tavern legally, it is also true that the government will protect him in this issue. Invasion of privacy is a tough rap for the police to break.</p>

<p>O'Hara looks inside the doorway at the two bodies on the floor, at those holding their heads and sides and wiping off blood, and at Accipiter, sitting like a vulture dreaming of carrion. One of the bodies gets up on all fours and crawls through between Gobrinus’ legs out into the street.</p>

<p><q>Sergeant, arrest that man!</q> Gobrinus says. <q>He's wearing an illegal fido. I accuse him of invasion of privacy.</q></p>

<p>O'Hara's face lights up. At least he'll get one arrest to his credit. Legrand is placed in the paddywagon, which arrives just after the ambulance. Red Hawk is carried out as far as the doorway by his friends. He opens his eyes just as he's being carried on a stretcher to the ambulance and he mutters.</p>

<p>O'Hara leans over him. <q>What?</q></p>

<p><q>I fought a bear once with only my knife, and I came out better than with those cunts. I charge them with assault and battery, murder and mayhem.</q></p>

<p>O'Hara's attempt to get Red Hawk to sign a warrant fails because Red Hawk is now unconscious. He curses. By the time Red Hawk begins feeling better, he'll refuse to sign the warrant. He won't want the girls and their boy friends laying for him, not if he has any sense at all.</p>

<p>Through the barred window of the paddywagon, Legrand screams, <q>I'm a gummint agent! You can't arrest me!</q></p>

<p>The police get a hurry-up call to go to the front of the Folk Center, where a fight between local youths and Westwood invaders is threatening to become a riot. Benedictine leaves the tavern. Despite several blows in the shoulders and stomach, a kick in the buttocks, and a bang on the head, she shows no signs of losing the fetus.</p>

<p>Chib, half-sad, half-glad, watches her go. He feels a dull grief that the baby is to be denied life. By now he realizes that part of his objection to the abortion is identification with the fetus; he knows what Grandpa thinks he does not know. He realizes that his birth was an accident—lucky or unlucky. If things had gone otherwise, he would not have been born. The thought of his nonexistence—no painting, no friends, no laughter, no hope, no love—horrifies him. His mother, drunkenly negligent about contraception, has had any number of abortions, and he could have been one of them.</p>

<p>Watching Benedictine swagger away (despite her torn clothes), he wonders what he could ever have seen in her. Life with her, even with a child, would have been gritty.</p>

<p>In the hope-lined nest of the mouth</p>

<p>Love flies once more, nestles down,</p>

<p>Coos, flashes feathered glory, dazzles,</p>

<p>And then flies away, crapping,</p>

<p>As is the wont of birds,</p>

<p>To jet-assist the takeoff.</p>

<p>—Omar Runic</p>

<p>Chib returns to his home, but he still can't get back into his room. He goes to the storeroom. The painting is seven-eighths finished but was not completed because he was dissatisfied with it. Now he takes it from the house and carries it to Runic's house, which is in the same clutch as his. Runic is at the Center, but he always leaves his doors open when he's gone. He has equipment which Chib uses to finish the painting, working with a sureness and intensity he lacked the first time he was creating it. He then leaves Runic's house with the huge oval canvas held above his head.</p>

<p>He strides past the pedestals and under their curving branches with the ovoids at their ends. He skirts several small grassy parks with trees, walks beneath more houses, and in ten minutes is nearing the heart of Beverly Hills. Here mercurial Chib sees</p>

<h3>All In the Golden Afternoon, Three Leaden Ladies</h3>

<p>drifting in a canoe on Lake Issus. Maryam bint Yusuf, her mother, and aunt listlessly hold fishing poles and look towards the gay colors, music, and the chattering crowd before the Folk Center. By now the police have broken up the juvenile fight and are standing around to make sure nobody else makes trouble.</p>

<p>The three women are dressed in the somber clothes, completely body-concealing, of the Mohammedan Wahhabi fundamentalist sect. They do not wear veils; not even the Wahhabi now insist on this. Their Egyptian brethren ashore are clad in modern garments, shameful and sinful. Despite which, the ladies stare at them.</p>

<p>Their menfolk are at the edge of the crowd. Bearded and costumed like sheiks in a Foreign Legion fido show, they mutter gargling oaths and hiss at the iniquitous display of female flesh. But they stare.</p>

<p>This small group has come from the zoological preserves of Abyssinia, where they were caught poaching. Their gummint gave them three choices. Imprisonment in a rehabilitation center, where they would be treated until they became good citizens if it took the rest of their lives. Emigration to the megalopolis of Haifa, Israel. Or emigration to Beverly Hills, LA.</p>

<p>What, dwell among the accursed Jews of Israel? They spat and chose Beverly Hills. Alas, Allah had mocked them! They were now surrounded by Finkelsteins, Applebaums, Siegels, Weintraubs, and others of the infidel tribes of Isaac. Even worse, Beverly Hills had no mosque. They either traveled forty kilometers every day to the 16th level, where a mosque was available, or used a private home.</p>

<p>Chib hastens to the edge of the plastic-edged lake and puts down his painting and bows low, whipping off his somewhat battered hat. Maryam smiles at him but loses the smile when the two chaperones reprimand her.</p>

<p><q><i>Ya kelb! Ya ibn kelb</i>!</q> the two shout at him.</p>

<p>Chib grins at them, waves his hat, and says, <q>Charmed, I'm sure, mesdames! Oh, you lovely ladies remind me of the Three Graces.</q></p>

<p>He then cries out, <q>I love you, Maryam! I love you! Thou art like the Rose of Sharon to me! Beautiful, doe-eyed, virginal! A fortress of innocence and strength, filled with a fierce motherhood and utter faithfulness to thy one true love! I love thee, thou art the only light in a black sky of dead stars! I cry to you across the void!</q></p>

<p>Maryam understands World English, but the wind carries his words away from her. She simpers, and Chib cannot help feeling a momentary repulsion, a flash of anger as if she has somehow betrayed him. Nevertheless, he rallies and shouts, <q>I invite you to come with me to the showing! You and your mother and aunt will be my guests. You can see my paintings, my soul, and know what kind of man is going to carry you off on his Pegasus, my dove!</q></p>

<p>There is nothing as ridiculous as the verbal outpourings of a young poet in love. Outrageously exaggerated. I laugh. But I am also touched. Old as I am, I remember my first loves, the fire, the torrents of words, lightning-sheathed, ache-winged. Dear lasses, most of you are dead; the rest, withered. I blow you a kiss.</p>

<p>—Grandpa</p>

<p>Maryam's mother stands up in the canoe. For a second, her profile is to Chib, and he sees intimations of the hawk that Maryam will be when she is her mother's age. Maryam now has a gently aquiline face—"the sweep of the sword of love"—Chib has called that nose. Bold but beautiful. However, her mother does look like a dirty old eagle. And her aunt—uneaglish but something of the camel in those features.</p>

<p>Chib suppresses these unfavorable, even treacherous, comparisons. But he cannot suppress the three bearded, robed, and unwashed men who gather around him.</p>

<p>Chib smiles but says, <q>I don't remember inviting you.</q></p>

<p>They look blank since rapidly spoken LA English is a huftymagufty to them. Abu—generic name for any Egyptian in Beverly Hills—rasps an oath so ancient even the pre-Mohammed Meccans knew it. He forms a fist. Another Arab steps towards the painting and draws back a foot as if to kick it.</p>

<p>At this moment, Maryam's mother discovers that it is as dangerous to stand in a canoe as on a camel. It is worse, because the three women cannot swim.</p>

<p>Neither can the middle-aged Arab who attacks Chib, only to find his victim sidestepping and then urging him on into the lake with a foot in the rear. One of the young men rushes Chib; the other starts to kick at the painting. Both halt on hearing the three women scream and on seeing them go over into the water.</p>

<p>Then the two run to the edge of the lake, where they also go into the water, propelled by one of Chib's hands in each of their backs. A bolgan hears the six of them screaming and thrashing around and runs over to Chib. Chib is becoming concerned because Maryam is having trouble staying above the water. Her terror is not faked.</p>

<p>What Chib does not understand is why they are all carrying on so. Their feet must be on the bottom; the surface is below their chins. Despite which, Maryam looks as if she is going to drown. So do the others, but he is not interested in them. He should go in after Maryam. However, if he does, he will have to get a change of clothes before going to the showing.</p>

<p>At this thought, he laughs loudly and then even more loudly as the bolgan goes in after the women. He picks up the painting and walks off laughing. Before he reaches the Center, he sobers.</p>

<p><q>Now, how come Grandpa was so right? How does he read me so well? Am I fickle, too shallow? No, I have been too deeply in love too many times. Can I help it if I love Beauty, and the beauties I love do not have enough Beauty? My eye is too demanding; it cancels the urgings of my heart.</q></p>

<h3>The Massacre of the Inner Sense</h3>

<p>The entrance hall (one of twelve) which Chib enters was designed by Grandpa Winnegan. The visitor comes into a long curving tube lined with mirrors at various angles. He sees a triangular door at the end of the corridor. The door seems to be too tiny for anybody over nine years old to enter. The illusion makes the visitor feel as if he's walking up the wall as he progresses towards the door. At the end of the tube, the visitor is convinced he's standing on the ceiling.</p>

<p>But the door gets larger as he approaches until it becomes huge. Commentators have guessed that this entrance is the architect's symbolic representation of the gateway to the world of art. One should stand on his head before entering the wonderland of aesthetics.</p>

<p>On going in, the visitor thinks at first that the tremendous room is inside out or reversed. He gets even dizzier. The far wall actually seems the near wall until the visitor gets reorientated. Some people can't adjust and have to get out before they faint or vomit.</p>

<p>On the right hand is a hatrack with a sign: HANG YOUR HEAD HERE. A double pun by Grandpa, who always carries a joke too far for most people. If Grandpa goes beyond the bounds of verbal good taste, his great-great-grandson has overshot the moon in his paintings. Thirty of his latest have been revealed, including the last three of his Dog Series: <i>Dog Star, Dog Would</i>, and <i>Dog Tiered</i>. Ruskinson and his disciples are threatening to throw up. Luscus and his flock praise, but they're restrained. Luscus has told them to wait until he talks to young Winnegan before they go all-out. The fido men are busy shooting and interviewing both and trying to provoke a quarrel.</p>

<p>The main room of the building is a huge hemisphere with a bright ceiling which runs through the complete spectrum every nine minutes. The floor is a giant chessboard, and in the center of each square is a face, each of a great in the various arts. Michelangelo, Mozart, Balzac, Zeuxis, Beethoven, Li Po, Twain, Dostoyevsky, Farmisto, Mbuzi, Cupel, Krishnagurti, etc. Ten squares are left faceless so that future generations may add their own nominees for immortality.</p>

<p>The lower part of the wall is painted with murals depicting significant events in the lives of the artists. Against the curving wall are nine stages, one for each of the Muses. On a console above each stage is a giant statue of the presiding goddess. They are naked and have overripe figures: huge-breasted, broad-hipped, sturdy-legged, as if the sculptor thought of them as Earth goddesses, not refined intellectual types.</p>

<p>The faces are basically structured like the smooth placid faces of classical Greek statues, but they have an unsettling expression around the mouths and eyes. The lips are smiling but seem ready to break into a snarl. The eyes are deep and menacing. DON'T SELL ME OUT, they say. IF YOU DO&hellip;</p>

<p>A transparent plastic hemisphere extends over each stage and has acoustic properties which keep people who are not beneath the shell from hearing the sounds emanating from the stage and vice versa.</p>

<p>Chib makes his way through the noisy crowd towards the stage of Polyhymnia, the Muse who includes painting in her province. He passes the stage on which Benedictine is standing and pouring her lead heart out in an alchemy of golden notes. She sees Chib and manages somehow to glare at him and at the same time to keep smiling at her audience. Chib ignores her but observes that she has replaced the dress ripped in the tavern. He sees also the many policemen stationed around the building. The crowd does not seem in an explosive mood. Indeed, it seems happy, if boisterous. But the police know how deceptive this can be. One spark&hellip;</p>

<p>Chib goes by the stage of Calliope, where Omar Runic is extemporizing. He comes to Polyhymnia's, nods at Rex Luscus, who waves at him, and sets his painting on the stage. It is titled <i>The Massacre of the Innocents</i> (subtitle: <i>Dog in the Manger</i>).</p>

<p>The painting depicts a stable.</p>

<p>The stable is a grotto with curiously shaped stalactites. The light that breaks—or fractures—through the cave is Chib's red. It penetrates every object, doubles its strength, and then rays out jaggedly. The viewer, moving from side to side to get a complete look, can actually see the many levels of light as he moves, and thus he catches glimpses of the figures under the exterior figures.</p>

<p>The cows, sheep, and horses are in stalls at the end of the cave. Some are looking with horror at Mary and the infant. Others have their mouths open, evidently trying to warn Mary. Chib has used the legend that the animals in the manger were able to talk to each other the night Christ was born.</p>

<p>Joseph, a tired old man, so slumped he seems backboneless, is in a corner. He wears two horns, but each has a halo, so it's all right.</p>

<p>Mary's back is to the bed of straw on which the infant is supposed to be. From a trapdoor in the floor of the cave, a man is reaching to place a huge egg on the straw bed. He is in a cave beneath the cave and is dressed in modern clothes, has a boozy expression, and, like Joseph, slumps as if invertebrate. Behind him a grossly fat woman, looking remarkably like Chib's mother, has the baby, which the man passed on to her before putting the foundling egg on the straw bed.</p>

<p>The baby has an exquisitely beautiful face and is suffused with a white glow from his halo. The woman has removed the halo from his head and is using the sharp edge to butcher the baby.</p>

<p>Chib has a deep knowledge of anatomy, since he has dissected many corpses while getting his Ph.D. in art at Beverly Hills U. The body of the infant is not unnaturally elongated, as so many of Chib's figures are. It is more than photographic; it seems to be an actual baby. Its viscera is unraveled through a large bloody hole.</p>

<p>The onlookers are struck in their viscera as if this were not a painting but a real infant, slashed and disemboweled, found on their doorsteps as they left home.</p>

<p>The egg has a semitransparent shell. In its murky yolk floats a hideous little devil, horns, hooves, tail. Its blurred features resemble a combination of Henry Ford's and Uncle Sam's. When the viewers shift to one side or the other, the faces of others appear: prominents in the development of modern society.</p>

<p>The window is crowded with wild animals that have come to adore but have stayed to scream soundlessly in horror. The beasts in the foreground are those that have been exterminated by man or survive only in zoos and natural preserves. The dodo, the blue whale, the passenger pigeon, the quagga, the gorilla, orangutan, polar bear, cougar, lion, tiger, grizzly bear, California condor, kangaroo, wombat, rhinoceros, bald eagle.</p>

<p>Behind them are other animals and, on a hill, the dark crouching shapes of the Tasmanian aborigine and Haitian Indian.</p>

<p><q>What is your considered opinion of this rather remarkable painting, Doctor Luscus?</q> a fido interviewer asks.</p>

<p>Luscus smiles and says, <q>I'll have a considered judgment in a few minutes. Perhaps you'd better talk to Doctor Ruskinson first. He seems to have made up his mind at once. Fools and angels, you know.</q></p>

<p>Ruskinson's red face and scream of fury are transmitted over the fido.</p>

<p><q>The shit heard around the world!</q> Chib says loudly.</p>

<p><q>INSULT! SPITTLE! PLASTIC DUNG! A BLOW IN THE FACE OF ART AND A KICK IN THE BUTT FOR HUMANITY! INSULT! INSULT!</q></p>

<p><q>Why is it such an insult, Doctor Ruskinson?</q> the fido man says. <q>Because it mocks the Christian faith, and also the Panamorite faith? It doesn't seem to me it does that. It seems to me that Winnegan is trying to say that men have perverted Christianity, maybe all religions, all ideals, for their own greedy self-destructive purposes, that man is basically a killer and a perverter. At least, that's what I get out of it, although of course I'm only a simple layman, and&hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>Let the critics make the analysis, young man!</q> Ruskinson snaps. <q class="continued">Do you have a double Ph.D., one in psychiatry and one in art? Have you been certified as a critic by the government?</q></p>

<p><q>Winnegan, who has no talent whatsoever, let alone this genius that various self-deluded blowhards prate about, this abomination from Beverly Hills, presents his junk—actually a mishmash which has attracted attention solely because of a new technique that any electronic technician could invent—I am enraged that a mere gimmick, a trifling novelty, can not only fool certain sectors of the public but highly educated and federally certified critics such as Doctor Luscus here—although there will always be scholarly asses who bray so loudly, pompously, and obscurely that&hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>Isn't it true,</q> the fido man says, <q>that many painters we now call great, Van Gogh for one, were condemned or ignored by their contemporary critics? And&hellip;</q></p>

<p>The fido man, skilled in provoking anger for the benefit of his viewers, pauses. Ruskinson swells, his head a bloodvessel just before aneurysm.</p>

<p><q>I'm no ignorant layman!</q> he screams. <q>I can't help it that there have been Luscuses in the past! I know what I'm talking about! Winnegan is only a micrometeorite in the heaven of Art, not fit to shine the shoes of the great luminaries of painting. His reputation has been pumped up by a certain clique so it can shine in the reflected glory, the hyenas, biting the hand that feeds them, like mad dogs&hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>Aren't you mixing your metaphors a little bit?</q> the fido man says.</p>

<p>Luscus takes Chib's hand tenderly and draws him to one side where they're out of fido range.</p>

<p><q>Darling Chib,</q> he coos, <q>now is the time to declare yourself. You know how vastly I love you, not only as an artist but for yourself. It must be impossible for you to resist any longer the deeply sympathetic vibrations that leap unhindered between us. God, if you only knew how I dreamed of you, my glorious godlike Chib, with&hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>If you think I'm going to say yes just because you have the power to make or break my reputation, to deny me the grant, you're wrong,</q> Chib says. He jerks his hand away.</p>

<p>Luscus’ good eye glares. He says, <q>Do you find me repulsive? Surely it can't be on moral grounds&hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>It's the principle of the thing,</q> Chib says. <q>Even if I were in love with you, which I'm not, I wouldn't let you make love to me. I want to be judged on my merit alone, that only. Come to think of it, I don't give a damn about anybody's judgment. I don't want to hear praise or blame from you or anybody. Look at my paintings and talk to each other, you jackals. But don't try to make me agree with your little images of me.</q></p>

<h3>The Only Good Critic Is a Dead Critic</h3>

<p>Omar Runic has left his dais and now stands before Chib's paintings. He places one hand on his naked left chest, on which is tattooed the face of Herman Melville, Homer occupying the other place of honor on his right breast. He shouts loudly, his black eyes like furnace doors blown out by explosion. As has happened before, he is seized with inspiration derived from Chib's paintings.</p>

<p class="noindent"><q class="continued">Call me Ahab, not Ishmael.<br/>

For I have hooked the Leviathan.<br/>

I am the wild ass's colt born to a man.<br/>

Lo, my eye has seen it all!<br/>

My bosom is like wine that has no vent.<br/>

I am a sea with doors, but the doors are stuck.<br/>

Watch out! The skin will burst; the doors will break.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">You are Nimrod, I say to my friend, Chib.<br/>

And now is the hour when God says to his angels,<br/>

If this is what he can do as a beginning, then<br/>

Nothing is impossible for him.<br/>

He will be blowing his horn before<br/>

The ramparts of Heaven and shouting for<br/>

The Moon as hostage, the Virgin as wife,<br/>

And demanding a cut on the profits<br/>

From the Great Whore of Babylon.</q></p>

<p><q>Stop that son of a bitch!</q> the Festival Director shouts. <q>He'll cause a riot like he did last year!</q></p>

<p>The bolgani begin to move in. Chib watches Luscus, who is talking to the fido man. Chib can't hear Luscus, but he's sure Luscus is not saying complimentary things about him.</p>

<p><q>Melville wrote of me long before I was born.<br/>

I'm the man who wants to comprehend<br/>

The Universe but comprehend on my terms.<br/>

I am Ahab whose hate must pierce, shatter,<br/>

All impediment of Time, Space, or Subject<br/>

Mortality and hurl my fierce<br/>

Incandescence into the Womb of Creation,<br/>

Disturbing in its Lair whatever Force or<br/>

Unknown Thing-in-Itself crouches there,<br/>

Remote, removed, unrevealed.</q></p>

<p>The Director gestures at the police to remove Runic. Ruskinson is still shouting, although the cameras are pointing at Runic or Luscus. One of the Young Radishes, Huga Wells-Erb Heinsturbury, the science-fiction authoress, is shaking with hysteria generated by Runic's voice and with a lust for revenge. She is sneaking up on a <cite>Time</cite> fido man. <cite>Time</cite> has long ago ceased to be a magazine, since there are no magazines, but became a government-supported communications bureau. <cite>Time</cite> is an example of Uncle Sam's left-hand, right-hand, hands-off policy of providing communications bureaus with all they need and at the same time permitting the bureau executives to determine the bureau policies. Thus, government provision and free speech are united. This is fine, in theory, anyway.</p>

<p><cite>Time</cite> has preserved several of its original policies, that is, truth and objectivity must be sacrificed for the sake of a witticism and science-fiction must be put down. <cite>Time</cite> has sneered at every one of Heinsturbury's works, and so she is out to get some personal satisfaction for the hurt caused by the unfair reviews.</p>

<p><q><i>Quid nunc? Cui bono</i>?<br/>

Time? Space? Substance? Accident?<br/>

When you die—Hell? Nirvana?<br/>

Nothing is nothing to think about.<br/>

The canons of philosophy boom.<br/>

Their projectiles are duds.<br/>

The ammo heaps of theology blow up,<br/>

Set off by the saboteur Reason.</q></p>

<p><q>Call me Ephraim, for I was halted<br/>

At the Ford of God and could not tongue<br/>

The sibilance to let me pass.<br/>

Well, I can't pronounce shibboleth,<br/>

But I can say shit!</q></p>

<p>Huga Wells-Erb Heinsturbury kicks the <i>Time</i> fido man in the balls. He throws up his hands, and the football-shaped, football-sized camera sails from his hands and strikes a youth on the head. The youth is a Young Radish, Ludwig Euterpe Mahlzart. He is smoldering with rage because of the damnation of his tone poem, <i>Jetting The Stuff Of Future Hells</i>, and the camera is the extra fuel needed to make him blaze up uncontrollably. He punches the chief musical critic in his fat belly.</p>

<p>Huga, not the <i>Time</i> man, is screaming with pain. Her bare toes have struck the hard plastic armor with which the <i>Time</i> man, recipient of many such a kick, protects his genitals. Huga hops around on one foot while holding the injured foot in her hands. She twirls into a girl, and there is a chain effect. A man falls against the <i>Time</i> man, who is stooping over to pick up his camera.</p>

<p><q>Ahaaa!</q> Huga screams and tears off the <i>Time</i> man's helmet and straddles him and beats him over the head with the optical end of the camera. Since the solid-state camera is still working, it is sending to billions of viewers some very intriguing, if dizzying, pictures. Blood obscures one side of the picture, but not so much that the viewers are wholly cheated. And then they get another novel shot as the camera flies into the air again, turning over and over.</p>

<p>A bolgan has shoved his shock-stick against her back, causing her to stiffen and propel the camera in a high arc behind her. Huga's current lover grapples with the bolgan; they roll on the floor; a Westwood juvenile picks up the shock-stick and has a fine time goosing the adults around him until a local youth jumps him.</p>

<p><q>Riots are the opium of the people,</q> the police chief groans. He calls in all units and puts in a call to the chief of police of West-wood, who is, however, having his own troubles.</p>

<p>Runic beats his breast and howls</p>

<p><q>Sir, I exist! And don't tell me,<br/>

As you did Crane, that that creates<br/>

No obligation in you towards me.<br/>

I am a man; I am unique.<br/>

I've thrown the Bread out the window,<br/>

Pissed in the Wine, pulled the plug<br/>

From the bottom of the Ark, cut the Tree<br/>

For firewood, and if there were a Holy<br/>

Ghost, I'd goose him.<br/>

But I know that it all does not mean<br/>

A God damned thing,<br/>

That nothing means nothing,<br/>

That is is is and not-is not is is-not<br/>

That a rose is a rose is a<br/>

That we are here and will not be<br/>

And that is all we can know!</q></p>

<p>Ruskinson sees Chib coming towards him, squawks, and tries to escape. Chib seizes the canvas of <i>Dogmas from a Dog</i> and batters Ruskinson over the head with it. Luscus protests in horror, not because of the damage done to Ruskinson but because the painting might be damaged. Chib turns around and batters Luscus in the stomach with the oval's edge.</p>

<p><q>The earth lurches like a ship going down,<br/>

Its back almost broken by the flood of<br/>

Excrement from the heavens and the deeps,<br/>

What God in His terrible munificence<br/>

Has granted on hearing Ahab cry,<br/>

Bullshit! Bullshit!</q></p>

<p><q>I weep to think that this is Man<br/>

And this his end. But wait!<br/>

On the crest of the flood, a three-master<br/>

Of antique shape. The Flying Dutchman!<br/>

And Ahab is astride a ship's deck once more.<br/>

Laugh, you Fates, and mock, you Norns!<br/>

For I am Ahab and I am Man,<br/>

And though I cannot break a hole<br/>

Through the wall of What Seems<br/>

To grab a handful of What Is,<br/>

Yet, I will keep on punching.<br/>

And I and my crew will not give up,<br/>

Though the timbers split beneath our feet<br/>

And we sink to become indistinguishable<br/>

From the general excrement.</q></p>

<p><q>For a moment that will burn on the<br/>

Eye of God forever, Ahab stands<br/>

Outlined against the blaze of Orion,<br/>

Fist clenched, a bloody phallus,<br/>

Like Zeus exhibiting the trophy of<br/>

The unmanning of his father Cronus.<br/>

And then he and his crew and ship<br/>

Dip and hurtle headlong over<br/>

The edge of the world.<br/>

And from what I hear, they are still</q></p>

<h3>F</h3>

<p>Chib is shocked into a quivering mass by a jolt from a bolgan's electrical riot stick. While he is recovering, he hears his Grandpa's voice issuing from the transceiver in his hat.</p>

<p><q>Chib, come quick! Accipiter has broken in and is trying to get through the door of my room!</q></p>

<p>Chib gets up and fights and shoves his way to the exit. When he arrives, panting, at his home he finds that the door to Grandpa's room has been opened. The IRB men and electronic technicians are standing in the hallway. Chib bursts into Grandpa's room. Accipiter is standing in its middle and is quivering and pale. Nervous stone. He sees Chib and shrinks back, saying, <q>It wasn't my fault. I had to break in. It was the only way I could find out for sure. It wasn't my fault; I didn't touch him.</q></p>

<p>Chib's throat is closing in on itself. He cannot speak. He kneels down and takes Grandpa's hand. Grandpa has a slight smile on his blue lips. Once and for all, he has eluded Accipiter. In his hand is the latest sheet of his Ms.</p>

<h3>Through Balaklavas of Hate, They Charge Towards God</h3>

<p>For most of my life, I have seen only a truly devout few and a great majority of truly indifferent. But there is a new spirit abroad. So many young men and women have revived, not a love for God, but a violent antipathy towards Him. This excites and restores me. Youths like my grandson and Runic shout blasphemies and so worship Him. If they did not believe, they would never think about Him. I now have some confidence in the future.</p>

<h3>To the Sticks Via the Styx</h3>

<p>Dressed in black, Chib and his mother go down the tube entrance to level 13B. It's luminous-walled, spacious, and the fare is free. Chib tells the ticket-fido his destination. Behind the wall, the protein computer, no larger than a human brain, calculates. A coded ticket slides out of a slot. Chib takes the ticket, and they go to the bay, a great incurve, where he sticks the ticket into a slot. Another ticket protrudes, and a mechanical voice repeats the information on the ticket in World and LA English, in case they can't read.</p>

<p>Gondolas shoot into the bay and decelerate to a stop. Wheelless, they float in a continually rebalancing graviton field. Sections of the bay slide back to make ports for the gondolas. Passengers step into the cages designated for them. The cages move forward; their doors open automatically. The passengers step into the gondolas. They sit down and wait while the safety meshmold closes over them. From the recesses of the chassis, transparent plastic curves rise and meet to form a dome.</p>

<p>Automatically timed, monitored by redundant protein computers for safety, the gondolas wait until the coast is clear. On receiving the go-ahead, they move slowly out of the bay to the tube. They pause while getting another affirmation, trebly checked in micro-seconds. Then they move swiftly into the tube.</p>

<p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Other gondolas pass them. The tube glows yellowly as if filled with electrified gas. The gondola accelerates rapidly. A few are still passing it, but Chib's speeds up and soon none can catch up with it. The round posterior of a gondola ahead is a glimmering quarry that will not be caught until it slows before mooring at its destined bay. There are not many gondolas in the tube. Despite a 100-million population, there is little traffic on the north-south route. Most LAers stay in the self-sufficient walls of their clutches. There is more traffic on the east-west tubes, since a small percentage prefer the public ocean beaches to the municipality swimming pools.</p>

<p>The vehicle screams southward. After a few minutes, the tube begins to slope down, and suddenly it is at a 45-degree angle to the horizontal. They flash by level after level.</p>

<p>Through the transparent walls, Chib glimpses the people and architecture of other cities. Level 8, Long Beach, is interesting. Its homes look like two cut-quartz pie plates, one on top of another, open end on open end, and the unit mounted on a column of carved figures, the exit-entrance ramp a flying buttress.</p>

<p>At level 3A, the tube straightens out. Now the gondola races past establishments the sight of which causes Mama to shut her eyes. Chib squeezes his mother's hand and thinks of the half-brother and cousin who are behind the yellowish plastic. This level contains fifteen percent of the population, the retarded, the incurable insane, the too-ugly, the monstrous, the senile aged. They swarm here, the vacant or twisted faces pressed against the tube wall to watch the pretty cars float by.</p>

<p><q>Humanitarian</q> medical science keeps alive the babies that <i>should</i>—by Nature's imperative—have died. Ever since the 20th century, humans with defective genes have been saved from death. Hence, the continual spread of these genes. The tragic thing is that science can now detect and correct defective genes in the ovum and sperm. Theoretically, all human beings could be blessed with totally healthy bodies and physically perfect brains. But the rub is that we don't have near enough doctors and facilities to keep up with the births. This despite the ever decreasing drop in the birth rate.</p>

<p>Medical science keeps people living so long that senility strikes. So, more and more slobbering mindless decrepits. And also an accelerating addition of the mentally addled. There are therapies and drugs to restore most of them to <q>normalcy,</q> but not enough doctors and facilities. Some day there may be, but that doesn't help the contemporary unfortunate.</p>

<p>What to do now? The ancient Greeks placed defective babies in the fields to die. The Eskimos shipped out their old people on ice floes. Should we gas our abnormal infants and seniles? Sometimes, I think it's the merciful thing to do. But I can't ask somebody else to pull the switch when I won't.</p>

<p>I would shoot the first man to reach for it.</p>

<p>—from Grandpa's <cite>Private Ejaculations</cite></p>

<p><i>The gondola approaches one of the rare intersections. Its passengers see down the broad-mouthed tube to their right. An express flies towards them; it looms. Collision course. They know better, but they can't keep from gripping the mesh, gritting their teeth, and bracing their legs. Mama gives a small shriek. The flier hurtles over them and disappears, the flapping scream of air a soul on its way to underworld judgment.</i></p>

<p>The tube dips again until it levels out on 1. They see the ground below and the massive self-adjusting pillars supporting the megapolis. They whiz by over a little town, quaint, early 21st century LA preserved as a museum, one of many beneath the cube.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes after embarking, the Winnegans reach the end of the line. An elevator takes them to the ground, where they enter a big black limousine. This is furnished by a private-enterprise mortuary, since Uncle Sam or the LA government will pay for cremation but not for burial. The Church no longer insists on interment, leaving it to the religionists to choose between being wind-blown ashes or underground corpses.</p>

<p>The sun is halfway towards the zenith. Mama begins to have trouble breathing and her arms and neck redden and swell. The three times she's been outside the walls, she's been attacked with this allergy despite the air conditioning of the limousine. Chib pats her hand while they're riding over a roughly patched road. The archaic eighty-year-old, fuel-cell-powered, electric-motor-driven vehicle is, however, rough-riding only by comparison with the gondola. It covers the ten kilometers to the cemetery speedily, stopping once to let deer cross the road.</p>

<p>Father Fellini greets them. He is distressed because he is forced to tell them that the Church feels that Grandpa has committed sacrilege. To substitute another man's body for his corpse, to have mass said over it, to have it buried in sacred ground is to blaspheme. Moreover, Grandpa died an unrepentant criminal. At least, to the knowledge of the Church, he made no contrition just before he died.</p>

<p>Chib expects this refusal. St. Mary's of BH-14 has declined to perform services for Grandpa within its walls. But Grandpa has often told Chib that he wants to be buried beside his ancestors, and Chib is determined that Grandpa will get his wish.</p>

<p>Chib says, <q>I'll bury him myself! Right on the edge of the grave-yard!</q></p>

<p><q>You can't do that!</q> the priest, mortuary officials, and a federal agent say simultaneously.</p>

<p><q>The hell I can't! Where's the shovel?</q></p>

<p>It is then that he sees the thin dark face and falciform nose of Accipiter. The agent is supervising the digging up of Grandpa's (first) coffin. Nearby are at least fifty fido men shooting with their minicameras, the transceivers floating a few decameters near them. Grandpa is getting full coverage, as befits the Last Of The Billionaires and The Greatest Criminal Of The Century.</p>

<p>Fido interviewer: <q class="continued">Mr. Accipiter, could we have a few words from you? I'm not exaggerating when I say that there are probably at least ten billion people watching this historic event. After all, even the grade-school kids know of Win-again Winnegan.</q></p>

<p><q>How do you feel about this? You've been on the case for 26 years. The successful conclusion must give you great satisfaction.</q></p>

<p>Accipiter, unsmiling as the essence of diorite: <q>Well, actually, I've not devoted full time to this case. Only about three years of accumulative time. But since I've spent at least several days each month on it, you might say I've been on Winnegan's trail for 26 years.</q></p>

<p>Interviewer: <q>It's been said that the ending of this case also means the end of the IRB. If we've not been misinformed, the IRB was only kept functioning because of Winnegan. You had other business, of course, during this time, but the tracking down of counterfeiters and gamblers who don't report their income has been turned over to other bureaus. Is this true? If so, what do you plan to do?</q></p>

<p>Accipiter, voice flashing a crystal of emotion: <q class="continued">Yes, the IRB is being disbanded. But not until after the case against Winnegan's grand-daughter and her son is finished. They harbored him and are, therefore, accessories after the fact.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">In fact, almost the entire population of Beverly Hills, level 14, should be on trial. I know, but can't prove it as yet, that everybody, including the municipal chief of police, was well aware that Winnegan was hiding in that house. Even Winnegan's priest knew it, since Winnegan frequently went to mass and to confession. His priest claims that he urged Winnegan to turn himself in and also refused to give him absolution unless he did so.</q></p>

<p><q>But Winnegan, a hardened ‘mouse'—I mean, criminal, if ever I saw one, refused to follow the priest's urgings. He claimed that he had not committed a crime, that, believe it or not, Uncle Sam was the criminal. Imagine the effrontery, the depravity, of the man!</q></p>

<p>Interviewer: <q>Surely you don't plan to arrest the entire population of Beverly Hills 14?</q></p>

<p>Accipiter: <q>I have been advised not to.</q></p>

<p>Interviewer: <q>Do you plan on retiring after this case is wound up?</q></p>

<p>Accipiter: <q>No. I intend to transfer to the Greater LA Homicide Bureau. Murder for profit hardly exists any more, but there are still crimes of passion, thank God!</q></p>

<p>Interviewer: <q>Of course, if young Winnegan should win his case against you—he has charged you with invasion of domestic privacy, illegal housebreaking, and directly causing his great-great-grandfather's death—then you won't be able to work for the Homicide Bureau or any police department.</q></p>

<p>Accipiter, flashing several crystals of emotion: <q>It's no wonder we law enforcers have such a hard time operating effectively! Sometimes, not only the majority of citizens seem to be on the law-breaker's side but my own employers&hellip;</q></p>

<p>Interviewer: <q>Would you care to complete that statement? I'm sure your employers are watching this channel. No? I understand that Winnegan's trial and yours are, for some reason, scheduled to take place <i>at the same time</i>. How do you plan to be present at both trials? Heh, heh! Some fido-casters are calling you The Simultaneous Man!</q></p>

<p>Accipiter: <q>Well, ah, as you know, fifty years ago all large private-responsible! He incorrectly fed the data into a legal computer. The confusion of dates is being straightened out now. I might mention that the clerk is suspected of deliberately making the error. There have been too many cases like this&hellip;</q></p>

<p>Interviewer: <q>Would you mind summing up the course of this case for our viewers’ benefit? Just the highlights, please.</q></p>

<p>Accipiter: <q class="continued">Well, ah, as you know, fifty years ago all large private-enterprise businesses had become government bureaus. All except the building construction firm, the Finnegan Fifty-three States Company, of which the president was Finn Finnegan. He was the father of the man who is to be buried—somewhere—today.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Also, all unions except the largest, the construction union, were dissolved or were government unions. Actually, the company and its union were one, because all employees got ninety-five per cent of the money, distributed more or less equally among them. Old Finnegan was both the company president and union business agent-secretary.</q></p>

<p><q>By hook or crook, mainly by crook, I believe, the firm-union had resisted the inevitable absorption. There were investigations into Finnegan's methods: coercion and blackmail of U. S. Senators and even U. S. Supreme Court Justices. Nothing was, however, proved.</q></p>

<p>Interviewer: <q>For the benefit of our viewers who may be a little hazy on their history, even fifty years ago money was used only for the purchase of nonguaranteed items. Its other use, as today, was as an index of prestige and social esteem. At one time, the government was thinking of getting rid of currency entirely, but a study revealed that it had great psychological value. The income tax was also kept, although the government had no use for money, because the size of a man's tax determined prestige and also because it enabled the government to remove a large amount of currency from circulation.</q></p>

<p>Accipiter: <q>Anyway, when old Finnegan died, the federal government renewed its pressure to incorporate the construction workers and the company officials as civil servants. But young Finnegan proved to be as foxy and vicious as his old man. I don't suggest, of course, that the fact that his uncle was President of the U.S. at that time had anything to do with young Finnegan's success.</q></p>

<p>Interviewer: <q>Young Finnegan was seventy years old when his father died.</q></p>

<p>Accipiter: <q>During this struggle, which went on for many years, Finnegan decided to rename himself Winnegan. It's a pun on Win Again. He seems to have had a childish, even imbecilic, delight in puns, which, frankly, I don't understand. Puns, I mean.</q></p>

<p>Interviewer: <q class="continued">For the benefit of our non-American viewers, who may not know of our national custom of Naming Day &hellip; this was originated by the Panamorites. When a citizen comes of age, he may at any time thereafter take a new name, one which he believes to be appropriate to his temperament or goal in life. I might point out that Uncle Sam, who's been unfairly accused of trying to impose conformity upon his citizens, encourages this individualistic approach to life. This despite the increased record-keeping required on the government's part.</q></p>

<p><q>I might also point out something else of interest. The government claimed that Grandpa Winnegan was mentally incompetent. My listeners will pardon me, I hope, if I take up a moment of your time to explain the basis of Uncle Sam's assertion. Now, for the benefit of those among you who are unacquainted with an early 20th-century classic, <cite>Finnegan's Wake</cite>, despite your government's wish for you to have a free lifelong education, the author, James Joyce, derived the title from an old vaudeville song.</q></p>

<p>(Half-fadeout while a monitor briefly explains <q>vaudeville.</q>)</p>

<p><q class="continued">The song was about Tim Finnegan, an Irish hod carrier who fell off a ladder while drunk and was supposedly killed. During the Irish wake held for Finnegan, the corpse is accidentally splashed with whiskey. Finnegan, feeling the touch of the whiskey, the ‘water of life,’ sits up in his coffin and then climbs out to drink and dance with the mourners.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Grandpa Winnegan always claimed that the vaudeville song was based on reality, you can't keep a good man down, and that the original Tim Finnegan was his ancestor. This preposterous statement was used by the government in its suit against Winnegan.</q></p>

<p><q>However, Winnegan produced documents to substantiate his assertion. Later—too late—the documents were proved to be forgeries.</q></p>

<p>Accipiter: <q class="continued">The government's case against Winnegan was strengthened by the rank and file's sympathy with the government. Citizens were complaining that the business-union was undemocratic and discriminatory. The officials and workers were getting relatively high wages, but many citizens had to be contented with their guaranteed income. So, Winnegan was brought to trial and accused, justly, of course, of various crimes, among which were subversion of democracy.</q></p>

<p><q>Seeing the inevitable, Winnegan capped his criminal career. He somehow managed to steal 20 billion dollars from the federal deposit vault. This sum, by the way, was equal to half the currency then existing in Greater LA. Winnegan disappeared with the money, which he had not only stolen but had not paid income tax on. Unforgivable. I don't know why so many people have glamorized this villain's feat. Why, I've even seen fido shows with him as the hero, thinly disguised under another name, of course.</q></p>

<p>Interviewer: <q>Yes, folks, Winnegan committed the Crime Of The Age. And, although he has finally been located, and is to be buried today—somewhere—the case is not completely closed. The Federal government says it is. But where is the money, the 20 billion dollars?</q></p>

<p>Accipiter: <q class="continued">Actually, the money has no value now except as collector's items. Shortly after the theft, the government called in all currency and then issued new bills that could not be mistaken for the old. The government had been wanting to do something like this for a long time, anyway, because it believed that there was too much currency, and it only reissued half the amount taken in.</q></p>

<p><q>I'd like very much to know where the money is. I won't rest until I do. I'll hunt it down if I have to do it on my own time.</q></p>

<p>Interviewer: <q>You may have plenty of time to do that if young Winnegan wins his case. Well, folks, as most of you may know, Winnegan was found dead in a lower level of San Francisco about a year after he disappeared. His grand-daughter identified the body, and the fingerprints, earprints, retinaprints, teethprints, blood-type, hair-type, and a dozen other identity prints matched out.</q></p>

<p>Chib, who has been listening, thinks that Grandpa must have spent several millions of the stolen money arranging this. He does not know, but he suspects that a research lab somewhere in the world grew the duplicate in a biotank.</p>

<p>This happened two years after Chib was born. When Chib was five, his grandpa showed up. Without letting Mama know he was back, he moved in. Only Chib was his confidant. It was, of course, impossible for Grandpa to go completely unnoticed by Mama, yet she now insisted that she had never seen him. Chib thought that this was to avoid prosecution for being an accessory after the crime. He was not sure. Perhaps she had blocked off his <q>visitations</q> from the rest of her mind. For her it would be easy, since she never knew whether today was Tuesday or Thursday and could not tell you what year it was.</p>

<p>Chib ignores the mortuarians, who want to know what to do with the body. He walks over to the grave. The top of the ovoid coffin is visible now, with the long elephantlike snout of the digging machine sonically crumbling the dirt and then sucking it up. Accipiter, breaking through his lifelong control, is smiling at the fidomen and rubbing his hands.</p>

<p><q>Dance a little, you son of a bitch,</q> Chib says, his anger the only block to the tears and the wail building up in him.</p>

<p>The area around the coffin is cleared to make room for the grappling arms of the machine. These descend, hook under, and lift the black, irradiated-plastic, mocksilver-arabesqued coffin up and out and onto the grass. Chib, seeing the IRB men begin to open the coffin, starts to say something but closes his mouth. He watches intently, his knees bent as if getting ready to jump. The fidomen close in, their eyeball-shaped cameras pointing at the group around the coffin.</p>

<p>Groaning, the lid rises. There is a big bang. Dense dark smoke billows. Accipiter and his men, blackened, eyes wide and white, coughing, stagger out of the cloud. The fidomen are running every-which way or stooping to pick up their cameras. Those who were standing far enough back can see that the explosion took place at the bottom of the grave. Only Chib knows that the raising of the coffin lid has activated the detonating device in the grave.</p>

<p>He is also the first to look up into the sky at the projectile soaring from the grave because only he expected it. The rocket climbs up to five hundred feet while the fidomen train their cameras on it. It bursts apart and from it a ribbon unfolds between two round objects. The objects expand to become balloons while the ribbon becomes a huge banner.</p>

<p>On it, in big black letters, are the words</p>

<h3>Winnegan's Fake!</h3>

<p>Twenty billions of dollars buried beneath the supposed bottom of the grave burn furiously. Some bills, blown up in the geyser of fireworks, are carried by the wind while IRB men, fidomen, mortuary officials, and municipality officials chase them.</p>

<p>Mama is stunned.</p>

<p>Accipiter looks as if he is having a stroke.</p>

<p>Chib cries and then laughs and rolls on the ground.</p>

<p>Grandpa has again screwed Uncle Sam and has also pulled his greatest pun where all the world can see it.</p>

<p><q>Oh, you old man!</q> Chib sobs between laughing fits. <q>Oh, you old man! How I love you!</q></p>

<p>While he is rolling on the ground again, roaring so hard his ribs hurt, he feels a paper in his hand. He stops laughing and gets on his knees and calls after the man who gave it to him. The man says, <q>I was paid by your grandfather to hand it to you when he was buried.</q></p>

<p>Chib reads.</p>

<p>I hope nobody was hurt, not even the IRB men.</p>

<p>Final advice from the Wise Old Man In The Cave. Tear loose. Leave LA. Leave the country. Go to Egypt. Let your mother ride the purple wage on her own. She can do it if she practices thrift and self-denial. If she can't, that's not your fault.</p>

<p>You are fortunate indeed to have been born with talent, if not genius, and to be strong enough to want to rip out the umbilical cord. So do it. Go to Egypt. Steep yourself in the ancient culture. Stand before the Sphinx. Ask her (actually, it's a he) the Question.</p>

<p>Then visit one of the zoological preserves south of the Nile. Live for a while in a reasonable facsimile of Nature as she was before mankind dishonored and disfigured her. There, where Homo Sapiens(?) evolved from the killer ape, absorb the spirit of that ancient place and time.</p>

<p>You've been painting with your penis, which I'm afraid was more stiffened with bile than with passion for life. Learn to paint with your heart. Only thus will you become great and true.</p>

<p>Paint.</p>

<p>Then, go wherever you want to go. I'll be with you as long as you're alive to remember me. To quote Runic, <q>I'll be the Northern Lights of your soul.</q></p>

<p>Hold fast to the belief that there will be others to love you just as much as I did or even more. What is more important, you must love them as much as they love you.</p>

<p>Can you do this?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Afterword:</p>

<p>I'm strangely indifferent about getting a man onto the Moon. I say <i>strangely</i> because I've been reading science fiction since 1928 and selling science fiction stories since 1952. Moreover, I fully expected, and hoped and prayed, that we would be on Mars by 1940. About the time I was eighteen, I gave up this early date but still knew that someday, maybe 1970, we'd make it.</p>

<p>Also, I've been a military and commercial electronic technical writer since 1957 and at present am working for a company which is intimately concerned with the Saturn and Apollo space programs. Ten years ago, I would have been close to ecstasy if I could have worked on a space project. Rockets, Moon landings, airlocks, and all that.</p>

<p>But in the past eight years I've been increasingly interested in, and worried over, terrestrial problems. These are population explosion; birth control; the rape of Mother Nature; human, and animal, <q>rights</q>; international conflicts; and especially mental health. I'd like to see us explore space, but I don't think we have to. If the U.S. wants to spend its (my) money on space rockets, fine. I realize full well that space projects are more than going to pay their present expenses someday. Technological discoveries made along the way, serendipitous findings, plus such things as weather control, etc., will eventually make all this effort and expense worth while. I like to think so.</p>

<p>But let's spend at least an equal amount of money and research on trying to find out what makes people tick and mistick. If there has to be a choice between the two different kinds of projects, get rid of the space project. If this be treason, so be it. People are more important than rockets; we'll never be in harmony with that Nature which exists outside our atmosphere; we're doing an inept enough job of getting into harmony with sublunary Nature.</p>

<p>The idea for this story was sparked off when I attended a lecture at the home of Tom and Terry Pinckard. Lou Barron spoke of the Triple Revolution document, among other things. This publication contains a letter sent on March 22, 1964, by the Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple Revolution to President Lyndon B. Johnson, the politically safe reply from the President's Assistant Special Counsel, and the Triple Revolution report itself. The writers of the document know that mankind is on the threshold of an age which demands a fundamental re-examination of existing values and institutions. The three separate and mutually reinforcing revolutions are (1) the Cybernation Revolution, (2) the Weaponry Revolution, and (3) the Human Rights Revolution.</p>

<p>I will not outline this document; even this would take much space. But for those interested in the crises of our times, in what must be planned and done, and in the immediate and distant future, this document is vital. It may be acquired by writing to: The Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple Revolution, P. O. Box 4068, Santa Barbara, California.</p>

<p>Lou Barron was the first to mention the Triple Revolution in my presence and the last since. Yet this document may be a dating point for historians, a convenient pinpointing to indicate when the new era of <q>planned societies</q> began. It may take a place alongside such important documents as the Magna Carta, Declaration of Independence, Communist Manifesto, etc. Since the lecture, I've come across references to it in two magazines, but there were no elucidations. And during the lecture, Lou Barron said that the TRD, despite its importance, was still unknown to some economists and political science professionals on the UCLA campus.</p>

<p>Barron's lecture gave me the glimmerings of a story based on a future society extrapolated from present trends. I probably would not have done anything about it if Harlan Ellison, some months later, had not asked me for a story for this anthology. As soon as I heard that there would be no tabus, my eye rolled in a frenzy which some people may think coarse instead of fine. Up from the unconscious came the paraphrase of the Zane Grey title, <i>Riders of the Purple Sage</i>. Other things clicked into place as extrapolations followed.</p>

<p>Several things I'd like to make clear. One, this story represents only one of a dozen, each with entirely different future worlds, that I could write. The implications of the Triple Revolution document are many.</p>

<p>Two, the story here shows only the bones of what I wanted to write. Theoretically, there was no word limit, but in practice there had to be a stopping point. The 30,000 words here passed this, but the editors were indulgent. Actually, I wrote 40,000 words but forced myself to cut out many chapters and then to reduce those chapters left in. This resulted in 20,000 words which I later built up to 30,000 again. I had a number of episodes and of letters from various U. S. Presidents to various bureaus. The letters and replies were to show how the Great Withdrawal was initiated and how the enclosed multileveled cities were begun. A more detailed description of the physical construction of a community, THE OOGENESIS OF BEVERLY HILLS, LEVEL 14, was cut out, with the municipally organized jousts between teen-age gangs during the Folk Festival, a scene between Chib and his mother which would have given their relationship in more depth, a scene from a fido play based on the early days of the Panamorite sect, and about a dozen other chapters.</p>

<p>Three, the Triple Revolution document writers, it seems to me, are looking ahead only to the next fifty years. I jumped to 2166 A.D. because I'm sure that energy-matter conversion and duplication of material objects will be available by then. Probably before then. This belief is based on present developments in physics. (The protein computers mentioned in the story have already been predicted in a recent <i>Science News Letter</i>. I anticipated this in a science fiction story in 1955. As far as I know, my prediction was the first mention of protein computers in literature of any kind, science fiction, scientific, or otherwise.) Mankind will no longer have to rely on agriculture, stock-raising, fishing, or mining. Moreover, the cities will tend to become completely independent of national governments except as they need them to avoid international war. The struggle between the city-states and federal government is only implied in this story.</p>

<p>Four, the Triple Revolution document writers showed humility and good sense when they stated that they did not know as yet how to plan our society. They insist that a study of great width and depth must be made first and then the carrying out of recommendations should be done cautiously.</p>

<p>Five, I doubt that this will be done with the depth and caution required. The times are too pressing; the hot breath of Need is on our necks. Besides, the proper study of mankind has always been too much entangled with politics, prejudice, bureaucracy, selfishness, stupidity, ultraconservatism, and one trait all of us share: downright ignorance.</p>

<p>Six, despite which, I understand that our world <i>must</i> be planned, and I wish the planners good luck in their dangerous course.</p>

<p>Seven, I could be wrong.</p>

<p>Eight, I hope I am.</p>

<p>This story was written primarily as a story, not as a sounding board for ideas or as a prophecy. I became too interested in my characters. And, although the basic idea came from Lou Barron, he is responsible for nothing in the story. In fact, I doubt very much that he will like it.</p>

<p>Whatever the reception to the story, I had fun writing it.</p>
