<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Dr. Winters stepped out of the tiny
Greyhound station and into the midnight street that smelled of pines.  The
station’s window showed the only light, save for a luminous clockface several
doors down and a little neon beer logo two blocks farther on.  He could hear a
river.  It ran deep in a gorge west of town, but the town was only a few
streets wide and a mile or so long, and the current’s blurred roar was
distinct, like the noise of a ghost river running between the banks of dark
shop windows.  When he had walked a short distance, Dr. Winters set his
suitcase down, pocketed his hands, and looked at the stars – thick as
cobblestones in the black gulf.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“A mountain hamlet
– a mining town,” he said.  “Stars.  No moon.  We are in Bailey.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>He was talking to
his cancer.  It was in his stomach.  Since learning of it, he had developed
this habit of wry communication with it.  He meant to show courtesy to this
uninvited guest, Death.  It would not find him churlish, for that would make
its victory absolute.  Except, of course, that its victory would <i>be</i>
absolute, with or without his ironies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>He picked up his
suitcase and walked on.  The starlight made faint mirrors of the windows’
blackness and showed him the man who passed: lizard-lean, white-haired (at
fifty-seven), a man travelling on death’s business, carrying his own death in
him, and even bearing death’s wardrobe in his suitcase.  For this was filled –
aside from his medical kit and some scant necessities – with mortuary bags.  The
sheriff had told him on the phone of the improvisations that presently
enveloped the corpses, and so the doctor had packed these, laying them in his
case with bitter amusement, checking the last one’s breadth against his chest
before the mirror, as a woman will gauge a dress before donning it, and telling
his cancer:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“Oh, yes, that’s
plenty room enough for both of us!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>The case was
heavy, and he stopped frequently to rest and scan the sky.  What a night’s work
to do, probing pungent, soulless filth, eyes earthward, beneath such a ceiling
of stars!  It had taken five days to dig the ten men out.  The autumnal equinox
had passed, but the weather here had been uniformly hot.  And warmer still, no
doubt, so deep in the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>He entered the
courthouse by a side door.  His heels knocked on the linoleum corridor.  A door
at the end of it, on which was lettered NATE CRAVEN, COUNTY SHERIFF, opened
well before he reached it, and his friend stepped out to meet him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“Dammit, Carl,
you’re <i>still</i> so thin they could use you for a whip.  Gimme that.  You’re
in too good a shape already.  You don’t need the exercise.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>The case hung
weightless from the sheriff’s hand, imparting no tilt at all to his bull
shoulders.  Despite his implied self-derogation, he was only moderately paunched
for a man his age and size.  He had a rough-hewn face, and the bulk of brow,
nose, and jaw made his greenish eyes look small until one engaged them and felt
the snap and penetration of their intelligence.  In the office he half filled
two cups from a coffee urn and topped off both with bourbon from a bottle in
his desk.  When they had finished these, they had finished trading news of
mutual friends.  The sheriff mixed another round and sipped from his, in a
silence clearly prefatory to the work at hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“They talk about
rough justice,” he said.  “I’ve sure seen it now.  One of those … patients of
yours that you’ll be working on?  He was a killer.  Christ, ‘killer’ doesn’t
half say it.  A killer’s the least of what he was.  The blast killing <i>him</i>,
that was the justice part.  Those other nine, they were the rough.  And it just
galls the hell out of me, Carl!  If that kiss-ass boss of yours has his way,
the rough won’t even stop with their being dead!  There won’t even be any
compensation for their survivors!  Tell me – has he broke his back yet?  I
mean, touching his toes for Fordham Mutual?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“You refer, I take
it, to the estimable Coroner Waddleton of Fordham County.”  Dr. Winters paused
to sip his drink.  With a delicate flaring of his nostrils he communicated all
the disgust, contempt, and amusement he had felt in his four years as
pathologist in Waddleton’s office.  The sheriff laughed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“Clear pictures
seldom emerge from anything the coroner says,” the doctor continued.  “He took
your name in vain.  Vigorously and repeatedly.  These expressions formed his
opening remarks.  He then developed the theme of our office’s responsibility to
the letter of the law, and of the workmen’s compensation law in particular. 
Death benefits accrue only to the dependants of decedents whose deaths arise <i>out
of the course</i> of their employment, not merely <i>in</i> the course of it. 
Victims of a maniacal assault, though they die on the job, are by no means
necessarily compensable under the law.  We then contemplated the tragic injustice
of an insurance company – <i>any</i> insurance company – having to pay benefits
to unentitled persons, solely through the laxity and incompetence of
investigating officers.  Your name came up again, and Coroner Waddleton
subjected it to further abuse.  Fordham Mutual, campaign contributor or not, is
certainly a major insurance company and is therefore entitled to the same fair
treatment that all such companies deserve.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>Craven uttered a
bark of wrathful mirth and spat expertly into his wastebasket.  “Ah, the
impartial public servant!  What’s seven widows and sixteen dependant children,
next to Fordham Mutual?”  He drained his cup and sighed.  “I’ll tell you what,
Carl.  We’ve been five days digging those men out and the last two days sifting
half that mountain for explosive traces, with those insurance investigators
hanging on our elbows, and the most they could say was that there was ‘strong
presumptive evidence’ of a bomb.  Well, I don’t budge for that because I don’t
have to.  Waddleton can shove his ‘extraordinary circumstances.’  If you don’t
find anything in those bodies, then that’s all the autopsy there is to it, and
they get buried right here where their families want ‘em.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>The doctor was
smiling at his friend.  He finished his cup and spoke with his previous wry
detachment, as if the sheriff had not interrupted his narrative.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“The honourable
coroner then spoke with remarkable volubility on the subject of Autopsy Consent
forms and the malicious subversion of private citizens by vested officers of
the law.  He had, as it happened, a sheaf of such forms on his desk, all
signed, all with a rider clause typed in above the signatures.  A cogent
paragraph.  It had, among its other qualities, the property of turning the
coroner’s face purple when he read it aloud.  He read it aloud to me three
times.  It appeared that the survivors’ consent was contingent on two
conditions: that the autopsy be performed <i>in locum mortis</i>, that is to
say in Bailey, and that only if the coroner’s pathologist found concrete
evidence of homicide should the decedents be subject either to removal from
Bailey or to further necropsy.  It was well written.  I remember wondering who
wrote it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>The sheriff nodded
musingly.  He took Dr. Winters’s empty cup, set it by his own, filled both
two-thirds with bourbon, and added a splash of coffee to the doctor’s.  The two
friends exchanged a level stare, rather like poker players in the clinch.  The
sheriff regarded his cup, sipped from it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“<i>In locum
mortis.</i>  What-all does that mean exactly?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“In the place of
death.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“Oh.  Freshen that
up for you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“I’ve just started
it, thank you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>Both men laughed,
paused, and laughed again, some might have said immoderately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“He all but told
me that I <i>had</i> to find something to compel a second autopsy,” the doctor
said at length.  “He would have sold his soul – or taken out a second mortgage
on it – for a mobile X-ray unit.  He’s right, of course.  If those bodies have
trapped any bomb fragments, that would be the surest and quickest way of
finding them.  It still amazes me your Dr. Parsons could let his X-ray go
unfixed for so long.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“He sets bones,
stitches wounds, writes prescriptions, and sends anything tricky down the
mountain.  Just barely manages that.  Drunks don’t get much done.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“He’s gotten that
bad?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“He hangs on and
no more.  Waddleton was right there, not deputising him pathologist.  I doubt
he could find a cannonball in a dead rat.  I wouldn’t say it where it could
hurt him, as long as he’s still managing, but everyone here knows it.  His
patients sort of look after <i>him</i> half the time.  But Waddleton would have
sent you, no matter who was here.  Nothing but his best for party contributors
like Fordham Mutual.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>The doctor looked
at his hands and shrugged.  “So.  There’s a killer in the batch.  <i>Was</i>
there a bomb?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>Slowly the sheriff
planted his elbows on the desk and pressed his hands against his temples, as if
the question had raised a turbulence of memories.  For the first time the
doctor – half hearkening throughout to the never-quite-muted stirrings of the death
within him – saw his friend’s exhaustion: the tremor of hand, the bruised look
under the eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“When I’ve told
you what we have, I guess you’ll end up assuming what I do about it.  But I
think assuming is as far as any of us will get with this one.  It’s one of
those nightmare specials, Carl.  The ones no one ever does get to the bottom
of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“All right, then. 
About two months ago, we had a man disappear – Ronald Hanley.  Mine worker,
rock-steady, family man.  He didn’t come home one night, and we never found a
trace of him.  OK, that happens sometimes.  About a week later, the lady that
ran the laundromat, Sharon Starker, <i>she</i> disappeared, no trace.  We got
edgy then.  I made an announcement on the local radio about a possible weirdo
at large, spelled out special precautions everybody should take.  We put both
our squad cars on the night beat, and by day we set to work knocking on every
door in town collecting alibis for the two times of disappearance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“No good.  Maybe
you’re fooled by this uniform and think I’m a law officer, protector of the
people, and all that?  A natural mistake.  A lot of people were fooled.  In
less than seven weeks, six people vanished, just like that.  Me and my deputies
might as well have stayed in bed round the clock, for all the good we did.” 
The sheriff drained his cup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“Anyway, at last
we got lucky.  Don’t get me wrong now.  We didn’t go all hog-wild and actually
prevent a crime or anything.  But we <i>did</i> find a body – except it wasn’t
the body of any of the seven people that had disappeared.  We’d taken to
combing the woods nearest town, with temporary deputies from the miners to
help.  Well, one of those boys was out there with us last week.  It was hot –
like it’s been for a while now – and it was real quiet.  He heard this buzzing
noise and looked around for it, and he saw a bee-swarm up in the crotch of a
tree.  Except he was smart enough to know that that’s not usual around here –
beehives.  So it wasn’t bees.  It was bluebottle flies, a goddamned big cloud
of them, all over a bundle that was wrapped in a tarp.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>The sheriff
studied his knuckles.  He had, in his eventful life, occasionally met men
literate enough to understand his last name and rash enough to be openly amused
by it, and the knuckles – scarred knobs – were eloquent of his reactions.  He
looked back into his old friend’s eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“We got that thing
down and unwrapped it.  Billy Lee Davis, one of my deputies, he was in Vietnam,
been near some bad, bad things and held on.  Billy Lee blew his lunch all over
the ground when we unwrapped that thing.  It was a man.  Some of a man.  We
knew he’d stood six-two because all the bones were there, and he’d probably
weighed between two fifteen and two twenty-five, but he folded up no bigger
than a bag-size laundry package.  Still had his face, both shoulders, and the
left arm, but all the rest was clean.  It wasn’t animal work.  It was knife
work, all the edges neat as butcher cuts.  Except butchered meat, even when you
drain it all you can, will bleed a good deal afterwards, and there wasn’t one
goddamned drop of blood on the tarp, nor in that meat.  It was just as pale as
fish meat.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>Deep in his body’s
centre, the doctor’s cancer touched him.  Not a ravening attack – it sank one
fang of pain, questioningly, into new untasted flesh, probing the scope for its
appetite there.  He disguised his tremor with a shake of the head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“A cache, then.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>The sheriff
nodded.  “Like you might keep a pot roast in the icebox for making lunches.  I
took some pictures of his face, then we put him back and erased our traces. 
Two of the miners I’d deputised did a lot of hunting, were woods-smart.  So I
left them on the first watch.  We worked out positions and cover for them, and
drove back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“We got right on
tracing him, sent out descriptions to every town within a hundred miles.  He
was no one I’d ever seen in Bailey, nor anyone else either, it began to look
like, after we’d combed the town all day with the photos.  Then, out of the
blue, Billy Lee Davis smacks himself on the forehead and says, ‘Sheriff, <i>I</i>
seen this man somewhere in town, and not long ago!’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“He’d been shook
all day since throwing up, and then all of a sudden he just snapped to.  Was
dead sure.  Except he couldn’t remember where or when.  We went over and over
it, and he tried and tried.  It got to where I wanted to grab him by the ankles
and hang him upside down and shake him till it dropped out of him.  But it was
no damn use.  Just after dark we went back to that tree – we’d worked out a
place to hide the cars and a route to it through the woods.  When we were
close, we walkie-talkied the men we’d left for an all-clear to come up.  No
answer at all.  And when we got there, all that was left of our trap was the
tree.  No body, no tarp, no Special Assistant Deputies.  Nothing.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>This time Dr.
Winters poured the coffee and bourbon.  “Too much coffee,” the sheriff
muttered, but drank anyway.  “Part of me wanted to chew nails and break necks. 
And part of me was scared shitless.  When we got back, I got on the radio
station again and made an emergency broadcast and then had the man at the
station rebroadcast it every hour.  Told everyone to do everything in groups of
three, to stay together at night in threes at least, to go out little as
possible, keep armed and keep checking up on each other.  It had such a
damn-fool sound to it, but just pairing-up was no protection if half of one of
those pairs was the killer.  I sent our corpse’s picture out statewide, I
deputised more men and put them out on the streets to beef up the night patrol.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“It was the next
morning that things broke.  The sheriff of Rakehell called – he’s over in the
next county.  He said our corpse looked a lot like a man named Abel Dougherty,
a mill-hand with Con Wood over there.  I left Billy Lee in charge and drove
right out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“This Dougherty
had a cripple older sister he always checked back to by phone whenever he left
town for long, a habit no one knew about, probably embarrassed him.  Sheriff
Peck there only found out about it when the woman called him, said her
brother’d been four days gone for vacation and not rung her once.  He’d hardly
had her report for an hour when he got the picture I sent out, and recognised
it.  And <i>I</i> hadn’t been in his office more than ten minutes when Billy
Lee called me there.  He’d remembered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“When he’d seen
Dougherty was the Sunday night three days before we found him.  Where he’d seen
him was the Trucker’s Tavern outside the north end of town.  The man had made a
stir by being jolly drunk and latching onto a miner who was drinking there, man
named Joe Allen, who’d started at the mine about two months back.  Dougherty
kept telling him that he wasn’t Joe Allen, but Dougherty’s old buddy named
Sykes that had worked with him at Con Wood for a coon’s age, and what the hell
kind of joke was this, come have a beer old buddy and tell me why you took off
so sudden and what the hell you been doing with yourself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“Allen took it
laughing.  Dougherty’d clap him on the shoulder, Allen’d clap him right back
and make every kind of joke about it, say, ‘Give this man another beer, I’m
standing in for a long-lost friend of his.’  Dougherty was so big and loud and
stubborn, Billy Lee was worried about a fight starting, and he wasn’t the only
one worried.  But this Joe Allen was a natural good ol’ boy, handled it perfect. 
We’d checked him out weeks back along with everyone else, and he was real
popular with the other miners.  Finally Dougherty swore he was going to take
him on to another bar to help celebrate the vacation Dougherty was starting out
on.  Joe Allen got up grinning, said goddamn it, he couldn’t accommodate
Dougherty by being this fellow Sykes, but he could sure as hell have a glass
with any serious drinking man that was treating.  He went out with him, and
gave everyone a wink as he left, to the general satisfaction of the audience.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>Craven paused. 
Dr. Winters met his eyes and knew his thought, two images: the jolly wink that
roused the room to laughter, and the thing in the tarp aboil with bright blue
flies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“It was plain
enough for me,” the sheriff said.  “I told Billy Lee to search Allen’s room at
the Skettles’ boarding-house and then go straight to the mine and take him.  We
could fine-polish things once we had him.  Since I was already in Rakehell, I
saw to some of the loose ends before I started back.  I went with Sheriff Peck
down to Con Wood, and we found a picture of Eddie Sykes in the personnel file. 
I’d seen Joe Allen often enough, and it was his picture in that file.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“We found out
Sykes had lived alone, was an on-again, off-again worker, private in his
comings and goings, and hadn’t been around for a while.  But one of the sawyers
there could be pretty sure of when Sykes left Rakehell because he’d gone to
Sykes’s cabin the morning after a big meteor shower they had out there about
nine weeks back, since some thought the shower might have reached the ground,
and not far from Sykes’s side of the mountain.  He wasn’t in that morning, and
the sawyer hadn’t seen him since.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“After all those
weeks, it was sewed up just like that.  Within another hour I was almost back
in Bailey, had the pedal to the metal, and was barely three miles out of town,
when it all blew to shit.  I <i>heard</i> it blow, I was that close to
collaring him.  I tell you, Carl, I felt … like a <i>bullet</i>.  I was going
to rip through this Sykes, this goddamned cannibal monster …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“We had to
reconstruct what happened.  Billy Lee got impatient and went after him alone,
but luckily he radioed Travis – my other deputy – first.  Travis was on the
mountain dragnetting around that tree for clues, but he happened to be near his
car when Billy Lee called him.  He said he’d just been through Allen’s room and
had got something really odd.  It was a sphere, half again as big as a
basketball, heavy, made of something that wasn’t metal or glass but was a
little like both.  He could half-see into it, and it looked to be full of some
kind of circuitry and components.  He hadn’t found anything else unusual.  He
was going to take this thing along with him, and go after Allen now.  He told
Travis to get up to the mine for backup.  He’d be there first and should
already have Allen by the time Travis arrived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“Tierney, the
shift boss up there, had an assistant that told us the rest.  Billy Lee parked
behind the offices where the men in the yard wouldn’t see the car.  He went
upstairs to arrange the arrest with Tierney.  They got half a dozen men
together.  Just as they came out of the building, they saw Allen take off
running from the squad car.  He had the sphere under his arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“The whole
compound’s fenced in, and Tierney’d already phoned to have all the gates shut. 
Allen zigged and zagged some, but caught on quick to the trap.  The sphere
slowed him, but he still had a good lead.  He hesitated a minute and then ran
straight for the main shaft.  A cage was just going down with a crew, and he
risked every bone in him jumping down after it, but he got safe on top.  By the
time they got to the switches, the cage was down to the second level, and Allen
and the crew had got out.  Tierney got it back up.  Billy Lee ordered the rest
back to get weapons and follow, and him and Tierney rode the cage right back
down.  And about two minutes later half the goddamned mine blew up.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>The sheriff
stopped as if cut off, his lips parted to say more, his eyes registering for
perhaps the hundredth time his amazement that there was no more, that the weeks
of death and mystification ended here, with this split-second recapitulation:
more death, more answerless dark, sealing all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“Nate.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“What.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“Wrap it up and go
to bed.  I don’t need your help.  You’re dead on your feet.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“I’m not on my
feet.  And I’m coming along.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“Give me a picture
of the victims’ position relative to the blast.  I’m going to work, and you’re
going to bed.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>The sheriff shook
his head absently.  “They’re mining in shrinkage stopes.  The adits – levels –
branch off lateral from the vertical shaft.  From one level they hollow out
overhand up to the one above.  Scoop out big chambers and let most of the
broken rock stay inside so they can stand on the heaps to cut the ceiling higher. 
They leave sections of support wall between stopes, and those men were buried
several stopes in from the shaft.  The cave-in killed <i>them</i>.  The
mountain just folded them up in their own hill of tailings.  No kind of
fragments reached them.  I’m dead sure.  The only ones they <i>found</i> were
of some standard charges that the main blast set off, and those didn’t even get
close.  The big one blew out where the adit joined the shaft, right where, and
right when, Billy Lee and Tierney got out of the cage.  And there is <i>nothing</i>
left there, Carl.  No sphere, no cage, no Tierney, no Billy Lee Davis.  Just
rock blown fine as flour.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>Dr. Winters nodded
and, after a moment, stood up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>“Come on, Nate. 
I’ve got to get started.  I’ll be lucky to have even a few of them done before
morning.  Drop me off and go to sleep, till then at least.  You’ll still be
there to witness most of the work.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in'><span lang=EN-GB>The sheriff rose,
took up the doctor’s suitcase, and led him out of the office without a word,
concession in his silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>The patrol car was behind the
building.  The doctor saw a crueller beauty in the stars than he had an hour
before.  They got in, and Craven swung them out onto the empty street.  The
doctor opened the window and hearkened, but the motor’s surge drowned out the
river sound.  Before the thrust of their headlights, ranks of old-fashioned
parking meters sprouted shadows tall across the sidewalks, shadows that shrank
and were cut down by the lights’ passage.  The sheriff said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“All those
extra dead.  For nothing!  Not even to … <i>feed</i> him!  If it <i>was</i> a
bomb, and he made it, he’d know how powerful it was.  He wouldn’t try some
stupid escape stunt with it.  And how did he even know that globe was there? 
We worked it out that Allen was just ending a shift, but he wasn’t even up out
of the ground before Billy Lee’d parked out of sight from the shaft.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Let it rest,
Nate.  I want to hear more, but after you’ve slept.  I know you.  All the
photos will be there, and the report complete, all the evidence neatly boxed
and carefully described.  When I’ve looked things over, I’ll know exactly how
to proceed by myself.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Bailey had
neither hospital nor morgue, and the bodies were in a defunct ice-plant on the
edge of town.  A generator had been brought down from the mine, lighting
improvised, and the refrigeration system reactivated.  Dr. Parson’s office, and
the tiny examining room that served the sheriff’s station in place of a morgue,
had furnished this makeshift with all the equipment that Dr. Winters would need
beyond what he carried with him.  A quarter-mile outside the main body of the
town, they drew up to it.  Tree-flanked, unneighboured by any other structure,
it was a double building; the smaller half – the office – was illuminated.  The
bodies would be in the big windowless refrigerator segment.  Craven pulled up
beside a second squad car parked near the office door.  A short rake-thin man
wearing a large white stetson got out of the car and came over.  Craven rolled
down his window.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Trav.  This
here’s Dr. Winters.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“’Lo, Nate. 
Dr. Winters.  Everything’s shipshape inside.  Felt more comfortable out here. 
Last of those newshounds left two hours ago.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“They sure do
hang on.  You take off now, Trav.  Get some sleep and be back at sunup.  What
temperature we getting?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The pale
stetson, far clearer in the starlight than the shadowface beneath it, wagged
dubiously.  “Thirty-six.  She won’t get lower – some kind of leak.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“That should be
cold enough,” the doctor said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Travis drove
off, and the sheriff unlocked the padlock on the office door.  Waiting behind
him, Dr. Winters heard the river again – a cold balm, a whisper of freedom –
and overlying this, the stutter and soft snarl of the generator behind the
building, a gnawing, remorseless sound that somehow fed the obscure anguish
that the other soothed.  They went in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The
preparations had been thoughtful and complete.  “You can wheel ‘em out of the
fridge on this and do the examining in here,” the sheriff said, indicating a
table and a gurney.  “You should find all the gear you need on this big table
here, and you can write up your reports on that desk.  The phone’s not hooked
up – there’s a pay phone at the last gas station if you have to call me.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The doctor
nodded, checking over the material on the larger table: scalpels, post-mortem
and cartilage knives, intestine scissors, rib shears, forceps, probes, mallet
and chisels, a blade saw and electric bone saw, scale, jars for specimens,
needles and suture, steriliser, gloves … Beside this array were a few boxes and
envelopes with descriptive sheets attached, containing the photographs and such
evidentiary objects as had been found associated with the bodies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Excellent,” he
muttered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“The overhead
light’s fluorescent, full spectrum or whatever they call it.  Better for
colours.  There’s a pint of decent bourbon in that top desk drawer.  Ready to
look at ‘em?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Yes.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The sheriff
unbarred and slid back the big metal door to the refrigeration chamber.  Icy
tainted air boiled out of the doorway.  The light within was dimmer than that
provided in the office – a yellow gloom wherein ten oblong heaps lay on
trestles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The two stood
silent for a time, their stillness a kind of unpremeditated homage paid to the
eternal mystery at its threshold.  As if the cold room were in fact a shrine,
the doctor found a peculiar awe in the row of veiled forms.  The awful unison
of their dying, the titan’s grave that had been made form them, conferred on
them a stern authority, Death’s Chosen Ones.  His stomach hurt, and he found he
had his hand pressed to his abdomen.  He glanced at Craven and was relieved to
see that his friend, staring wearily at the bodies, had missed the gesture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Nate.  Help me
uncover them.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Starting at
opposite ends of the row, they stripped the tarps off and piled them in a
corner.  Both were brusque now, not pausing over the revelation of the swelled,
pulpy faces – most three-lipped with the gaseous burgeoning of their tongues –
and the fat, livid hands sprouting from the filthy sleeves.  But at one of the
bodies Craven stopped.  The doctor saw him look, and his mouth twist.  Then he
flung the tarp on the heap and moved to the next trestle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>When they came
out, Dr. Winters took out the bottle and glasses Craven had put in the desk,
and they had a drink together.  The sheriff made as if he would speak, but
shook his head and sighed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“I <i>will</i>
get some sleep, Carl.  I’m getting crazy thoughts with this thing.”  The doctor
wanted to ask those thoughts.  Instead he laid a hand on his friend’s shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Go home,
Sheriff Craven.  Take off the badge and lie down.  The dead won’t run off on
you.  We’ll all still be here in the morning.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>When the sound of the patrol car
faded, the doctor stood listening to the generator’s growl and the silence of
the dead, resurgent now.  Both the sound and the silence seemed to mock him. 
The afterecho of his last words made him uneasy.  He said to his cancer:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“What about us,
dear colleague?  We <i>will</i> still be here tomorrow?  All of us?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He smiled, but
felt an odd discomfort, as if he had ventured a jest in company and roused a
hostile silence.  He went to the refrigerator door, rolled it back, and viewed
the corpses in their ordered rank, with their strange tribunal air.  “What,
sirs?” he murmured.  “Do you judge me?  Just who is to examine whom tonight, if
I may ask?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He went back
into the office, where his first step was to examine the photographs made by
the sheriff in order to see how the dead had lain at their uncovering.  The
earth had seized them with terrible suddenness.  Some crouched, some partly
stood, others sprawled in crazy free-fall postures.  Each successive photo
showed more of the jumble as the shovels continued their work between shots. 
The doctor studied them closely, noting the identifications inked on the bodies
as they came completely into view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>One man, Roger
Willet, had died some yards from the main cluster.  It appeared he had just
straggled into the slope from the adit at the moment of the explosion.  He
should thus have received, more directly than any of the others, the shock
waves of the blast.  If bomb fragments were to be found in any of the corpses,
Mr. Willet’s seemed likeliest to contain them.  Dr. Winters pulled on a pair of
surgical gloves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Willet lay at
one end of the line of trestles.  He wore a thermal shirt and overalls that
were strikingly new beneath the filth of burial.  Their tough fabrics jarred
with the fabric of his flesh – blue, swollen, seeming easily torn or burst,
like ripe fruit.  In life Willet had grease-combed his hair.  Now it was a
sculpture of dust, spikes and whorls shaped by the head’s last grindings
against the mountain that clenched it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Rigor had come
and gone – Willet rolled laxly onto the gurney.  As the doctor wheeled him past
the others, he felt a slight self-consciousness.  The sense of some judgement
flowing from the dead assembly – unlike most such vagrant fantasies – had an
odd tenacity in him.  This stubborn unease began to irritate him with himself,
and he moved more briskly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He put Willet
on the examining table and cut the clothes off him with shears, storing the
pieces in an evidence box.  The overalls were soiled with agonal waste
expulsions.  The doctor stared a moment with unwilling pity at his naked
subject.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“You won’t ride
down to Fordham in any case,” he said to the corpse.  “Not unless I find
something pretty damned obvious.”  He pulled his gloves tighter and arranged
his implements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Waddleton had
said more to him than he had reported to the sheriff.  The doctor was to find,
and forcefully to record that he had found, strong ‘indications’ absolutely
requiring the decedents’ removal to Fordham for X-ray and an exhaustive second
post-mortem.  The doctor’s continued employment with the Coroner’s Office
depended entirely on his compliance in this.  He had received this stipulation
with a silence Waddleton had not thought it necessary to break.  His present
resolution was all but made at that moment.  Let the obvious be taken as such. 
If the others showed as plainly as Willet did the external signs of death by
asphyxiation, they would receive no more than a thorough external exam.  Willet
he would examine internally as well, merely to establish in depth for this one
what should appear obvious in all.  Otherwise, only when the external exam
revealed a clearly anomalous feature – and clear and suggestive it must be –
would he look deeper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He rinsed the
caked hair in a basin, poured the sediment into a flask and labelled it. 
Starting with the scalp, he began a minute scrutiny of the body’s surfaces,
recording his observations as he went.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The
characteristic signs of asphyxial death were evident, despite the complicating
effects of autolysis and putrefaction.  The eyeballs’ bulge and the tongue’s
protrusion were, by now, as much due to gas pressure as to the mode of death,
but the latter organ was clamped between locked teeth, leaving little doubt as
to that mode.  The coloration of degenerative change – a greenish-yellow tint,
a darkening and mapping-out of superficial veins – was marked, but not
sufficient to obscure the blue of cyanosis on the face and neck, nor the
pinpoint haemorrhages freckling neck, chest, and shoulders.  From the mouth and
nose the doctor scraped matter he was confident was the blood-tinged mucous
typically ejected in the airless agony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He began to
find a kind of comedy in his work.  What a buffoon death made of a man!  A blue
pop-eyed three-lipped thing.  And there was himself, his curious solicitous
intimacy with this clownish carrion.  Excuse me, Mr. Willet, while I probe this
laceration.  What do you feel when I do this?  Nothing?  Nothing at all?  Fine,
now what about these nails?  Split them clawing at the earth, did you?  Yes.  A
nice bloodblister under this thumbnail, I see – got it on the job a few days
before your accident, no doubt?  Remarkable calluses here, still quite tough …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The doctor
looked for an unanalytic moment at the hands – puffed dark paws, gestureless,
having renounced all touch and grasp.  He felt the wastage of the man
concentrated in the hands.  The painful futility of the body’s fine
articulation when it is seen in death – this poignancy he had long learned not
to acknowledge when he worked.  But now he let it move him a little.  This
Roger Willet, plodding to his work one afternoon, had suddenly been scrapped,
crushed to a non-functional heap of perishable materials.  It simply happened
that his life had chanced to move too close to the passage of a more powerful
life, one of those inexorable and hungry lives that leave human wreckage –
known or undiscovered – in their wakes.  Bad luck, Mr. Willet.  Naturally, we
feel very sorry about this.  But this Joe Allen, your co-worker.  Apparently he
was some sort of … cannibal.  It’s complicated.  We don’t understand it all. 
But the fact is we have to dismantle you now to a certain extent.  There’s
really no hope of your using these parts of yourself again, I’m afraid.  Ready
now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The doctor
proceeded to the internal exam with a vague eagerness for Willet’s
fragmentation, for the disarticulation of that sadness in his natural form.  He
grasped Willet by the jaw and took up the post-mortem knife.  He sank its point
beneath the chin and began the long, gently sawing incision that opened Willet
from throat to groin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>In the
painstaking separation of the body’s laminae Dr. Winters found absorption and
pleasure.  And yet throughout he felt, marginal but insistent, the movement of
a stream of irrelevant images.  These were of the building that contained him,
and of the night containing it.  As from outside, he saw the plant – bleached
planks, iron roofing – and the trees crowding it, all in starlight, a
ghost-town image.  And he saw the refrigerator vault beyond the wall as from
within, feeling the stillness of murdered men in a cold yellow light.  And at
length a question formed itself, darting in and out of the weave of his
concentration as the images did: Why did he still feel, like some stir of the
air, that sense of mute vigilance surrounding his action, furtively touching
his nerves with its inquiry as he worked?  He shrugged, overtly angry now.  Who
else was attending but Death?  Wasn’t he Death’s hireling, and this Death’s
place?  Then let the master look on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Peeling back
Willet’s cover of haemorrhage-stippled skin, Dr. Winters read the corpse with
an increasing dispassion, a mortuary text.  He confined his inspection to the
lungs and mediastinum and found there unequivocal testimony to Willet’s
asphyxial death.  The pleurae of the lungs exhibited the expected ecchymoses –
bruised spots in the glassy enveloping membrane.  Beneath, the polyhedral
surface lobules of the lungs themselves were bubbled and blistered – the
expected interstitial emphysema.  The lungs, on section, were intensely and
bloodily congested.  The left half of the heart he found contracted and empty,
while the right was overdistended and engorged with dark blood, as were the
large veins of the upper mediastinum.  It was a classic picture of death by
suffocation, and at length the doctor, with needle and suture, closed up the
text again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He returned the
corpse to the gurney and draped one of his mortuary bags over it in the manner
of a shroud.  When he had help in the morning, he would weigh the bodies on a
platform scale the office contained and afterward bag them properly.  He came
to the refrigerator door, and hesitated.  He stared at the door, not moving,
not understanding why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><i><span lang=EN-GB>Run.  Get
out.  Now.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The thought was
his own, but it came to him so urgently he turned around as if someone behind
him had spoken.  Across the room a thin man in smock and gloves, his eyes
shadows, glared at the doctor from the black windows.  Behind the man was a
shrouded cart, behind that, a wide metal door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Quietly,
wonderingly, the doctor asked, “Run from what?”  The eyeless man in the glass
was still half-crouched, afraid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Then, a moment
later, the man straightened, threw back his head, and laughed.  The doctor
walked to the desk and sat down shoulder-to-shoulder with him.  He pulled out
the bottle and they had a drink together, regarding each other with identical
bemused smiles.  Then the doctor said, “Let me pour you another.  You need it,
old fellow.  It makes a man himself again.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Nevertheless
his re-entry of the vault was difficult, toilsome, each step seeming to require
a new summoning of the will to move.  In the freezing half-light all movement
felt like defiance.  His body lagged behind his craving to be quick, to be done
with this molestation of the gathered dead.  He returned Willet to his pallet
and took his neighbour.  The name on the tag wired to his boot was Ed Moses. 
Dr. Winters wheeled him back to the office and closed the big door behind him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>With Moses his
work gained momentum.  He expected to perform no further internal necropsies. 
He thought of his employer, rejoicing now in his seeming-submission to
Waddleton’s ultimatum.  The impact would be dire.  He pictured the coroner in
shock, a sheaf of Pathologist’s Reports in one hand, and smiled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Waddleton could
probably make a plausible case for incomplete examination.  Still, a
pathologist’s discretionary powers were not well-defined.  Many good ones would
approve the adequacy of the doctor’s method, given his working conditions.  The
inevitable litigation with a coalition of compensation claimants would be
strenuous and protracted.  Win or lose, Waddleton’s venal devotion to the
insurance company’s interest would be abundantly displayed.  Further,
immediately on his dismissal the doctor would formally disclose its occult
cause to the press.  A libel action would ensue that he would have as little
cause to fear as he had to fear his firing.  Both his savings and the lawsuit would
long outlast his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Externally, Ed
Moses exhibited a condition as typically asphyxial as Willet’s had been, with
no slightest mark of fragment entry.  The doctor finished his report and
returned Moses to the vault, his movements brisk and precise.  His unease was
all but gone.  That queasy stirring in the air – had he really felt it?  It had
been, perhaps, some new reverberation of the death at work in him, a psychic
shudder of response to the cancer’s stealthy probing for his life.  He brought
out the body next to Moses in the line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Walter Lou
Jackson was big, six feet two inches from heel to crown, and would surely weigh
out at more than two hundred pounds.  He had writhed mightily against his
million-ton coffin with an agonal strength that had torn his face and hands. 
Death had mauled him like a lion.  The doctor set to work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>His hands were
fully themselves now – fleet, exact, intricately testing the corpse’s character
as other fingers might explore a keyboard for its latent melodies.  And the
doctor watched them with an old pleasure, one of the few that had never failed
him, his mind at one remove from their busy intelligence.  All the hard
deaths!  A worldful of them, time without end.  Lives wrenched kicking from
their snug meat-frames.  Walter Lou Jackson had died very hard.  Joe Allen
brought this on you, Mr. Jackson.  We think it was part of his attempt to
escape the law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>But what a
botched flight!  The unreason of it – more than baffling – was eerie in its
colossal futility.  Beyond question, Allen had been cunning.  A ghoul with a
psychopath’s social finesse.  A good old boy who could make a tavernful of men
laugh with delight while he cut his victim from their midst, make them applaud
his exit with the prey, who stepped jovially into the darkness with murder at
his side clapping him on the shoulder.  Intelligent, certainly, with a strange
technical sophistication as well, suggested by the sphere.  Then what of the
lunacy yet more strongly suggested by the same object?  In the sphere was concentrated
all the lethal mystery of Bailey’s long nightmare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Why the
explosion?  Its location implied an ambush for Allen’s pursuers, a purposeful
detonation.  Had he aimed at a limited cave-in from which he schemed some
inconceivable escape?  Folly enough in this – far more if, as seemed sure,
Allen had made the bomb himself, for then he would have to know its power was
grossly inordinate to the need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>But if it was
not a bomb, had a different function and only incidentally an explosive
potential, Allen might underestimate the blast.  It appeared the object was
somehow remotely monitored by him, for the timing of events showed he had gone
straight for it the instant he emerged from the shaft – shunned the bus waiting
to take his shift back to town and made a beeline across the compound for a
patrol car that was hidden from his view by the office building.  This
suggested something more complex than a mere explosive device, something,
perhaps, whose destruction was itself more Allen’s aim than the explosion produced
thereby.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The fact that
he had risked the sphere’s retrieval at all pointed to this interpretation. 
For the moment he sensed its presence at the mine, he must have guessed that
the murder investigation had led to its discovery and removal from his room. 
But then, knowing himself already liable to the extreme penalty, why should
Allen go to such lengths to recapture evidence incriminatory of a lesser
offence, possession of an explosive device?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Then grant that
the sphere was something more, something instrumental to his murders that could
guarantee a conviction he might otherwise evade.  Still, his gambit made no
sense.  Since the sphere – and thus the lawmen he could assume to have taken it
– was already at the mine office, he must expect the compound to be sealed at
any moment.  Meanwhile, the gate was open, escape into the mountains a strong
possibility for a man capable of stalking and destroying two experienced and
well-armed woodsmen lying in ambush for him.  Why had he all but ensured his
capture to weaken a case against himself that his escape would have rendered
irrelevant?  Dr. Winters watched as his own fingers, like a hunting pack round
a covert, converged on a small puncture wound below Walter Lou Jackson’s
xiphoid process, between the eighth ribs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>His left hand
touched its borders, the fingers’ inquiry quick and tender.  The right hand
introduced a probe, and both together eased it into the wound.  It was rarely
fruitful to use a probe on corpses this decayed; the track of the wound would
more properly be examined by section.  But an inexplicable sense of urgency had
taken hold of him.  Gently, with infinite pains not to pierce in the softened
tissues an artefactual track of his own, he inched the probe in.  It moved
unobstructed deep into the body, curving upward through the diaphragm toward
the heart.  The doctor’s own heart accelerated.  He watched his hands move to
record the observation, watched them pause, watched them return to their survey
of the corpse, leaving pen and page untouched.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>External
inspection revealed no further anomaly.  All else he observed the doctor
recorded faithfully, wondering throughout at the distress he felt.  When he had
finished, he understood it.  Its cause was not the discovery of an entry wound
that might bolster Waddleton’s case.  For the find had, within moments,
revealed to him that, should he encounter anything he thought to be a mark of
fragment penetration, he was going to ignore it.  The damage Joe Allen had done
was going to end here, with this last grand slaughter, and would not extend to
the impoverishment of his victims’ survivors.  His mind was now made up: for
Jackson and the remaining seven, the external exams would be officially
recorded as contraindicating the need for any internal exam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>No, the doctor’s
unease as he finished Jackson’s external – as he wrote up his report and signed
it – had a different source.  His problem was that he did not believe the
puncture in Jackson’s thorax <i>was</i> a mark of fragment entry.  He
disbelieved this, and had no idea why he did so.  Nor had he any idea why, once
again, he felt afraid.  He sealed the report.  Jackson was now officially
accounted for and done with.  Then Dr. Winters took up the post-mortem knife
and returned to the corpse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>First the long
sawing slice, unzippering the mortal overcoat.  Next, two great square flaps of
flesh reflected, scrolled laterally to the armpits’ line, disrobing the chest:
one hand grasping the flap’s skirt, the other sweeping beneath it with the
knife, flensing through the glassy tissue that joined it to the chest wall, and
shaving all muscles from their anchorages to bone and cartilage beneath.  Then
the dismantling of the strongbox within.  Rib shears – so frank and forward a
tool, like a gardener’s.  The steel beak bit through each rib’s gristle anchor
to the sternum’s centreplate.  At the sternum’s crownpiece the collarbones’
ends were knifed, pried, and sprung free from their sockets.  The coffer
unhasped, unhinged, a knife teased beneath the lid and levered it off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Some minutes later
the doctor straightened up and stepped back from his subject.  He moved almost
drunkenly, and his age seemed scored more deeply in his face.  With loathing
haste he stripped his gloves off.  He went to the desk, sat down, and poured
another drink.  If there was something like horror in his face, there was also
a hardening in his mouth’s line and the muscles of his jaw.  He spoke to his
glass: “So be it, your Excellency.  Something new for your humble servant. 
Testing my nerve?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Jackson’s
pericardium, the shapely capsule containing his heart, should have been all but
hidden between the big blood-fat loaves of his lungs.  The doctor had found it
fully exposed, the lungs flanking it wrinkled lumps less than a third of their
natural bulk.  Not only they, but the left heart and the superior mediastinal
veins – all the regions that should have been grossly engorged with blood –
were utterly drained of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The doctor
swallowed his drink and got out the photographs again.  He found that Jackson
had died on his stomach across the body of another worker, with the upper part
of a third trapped between them.  Neither these two subjacent corpses nor the
surrounding earth showed any stain of a blood loss that must have amounted to
two litres.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Possibly the
pictures, by some trick of shadow, had failed to pick it up.  He turned to the
Investigator’s Report, where Craven would surely have mentioned any significant
amounts of bloody earth uncovered during the disinterment.  The sheriff
recorded nothing of the kind.  Dr. Winters returned to the pictures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Ronald Pollock,
Jackson’s most intimate associate in the grave, had died on his back, beneath
and slightly askew of Jackson, placing most of their torso in contact, save
where the head and shoulder of the third interposed.  It seemed inconceivable
Pollock’s clothing should lack any trace of such massive drainage from a death
mate thus embraced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The doctor rose
abruptly, pulled on fresh gloves, and returned to Jackson.  His hands showed a
more brutal speed now, closing the great incision temporarily with a few widely
spaced sutures.  He replaced him in the vault and brought out Pollock,
striding, heaving hard at the dead shapes in the shifting of them, thrusting
always – so it seemed to him – just a step ahead of urgent thoughts he did not
want to have, deformities that whispered at his back, emitting faint, chill
gusts of putrid breath.  He shook his head – denying, delaying – and pushed the
new corpse onto the worktable.  The scissors undressed Pollock in greedy bites.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>But at length,
when he had scanned each scrap of fabric and found nothing like the stain of
blood, he came to rest again, relinquishing that simplest, desired resolution
he had made such haste to reach.  He stood at the instrument table, not seeing
it, submitting to the approach of the half-formed things at his mind’s
periphery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The revelation
of Jackson’s shrivelled lungs had been more than a shock.  He had felt a stab
of panic too, in fact that same curiously explicit terror of this place that
had urged him to flee earlier.  He acknowledged now that the germ of that
quickly suppressed terror had been a premonition of this failure to find any
trace of the missing blood.  Whence the premonition?  It had to do with a
problem he had steadfastly refused to consider: the mechanics of so complete a
drainage of the lungs’ densely reticulated vascular structure.  Could the
earth’s crude pressure by itself work so thoroughly, given only a single vent
both slender and strangely curved?  And then the photograph he had studied.  It
frightened him now to recall the image – some covert meaning stirred within it,
struggling to be seen.  Dr. Winters picked the probe up from the table and
turned again to the corpse.  As surely and exactly as if he had already
ascertained the wound’s presence, he leaned forward and touched it: a small,
neat puncture, just beneath the xiphoid process.  He introduced the probe.  The
wound received it deeply, in a familiar direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The doctor went
to the desk and took up the photograph again.  Pollock’s and Jackson’s wounded
areas were not in contact.  The third man’s head was sandwiched between their
bodies at just that point.  He searched out another picture, in which this
third man was more central, and found his name inked in below his image: Joe Allen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Dreamingly, Dr.
Winters went to the wide metal door, shoved it aside, entered the vault.  He
did not search, but went straight to the trestle where Sheriff Craven had
paused some hours before.  He found the same name on its tag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The body,
beneath decay’s spurious obesity, was trim and well-muscled.  The face was
square-cut, shelf-browed, with a vulpine nose skewed by an old fracture.  The
swollen tongue lay behind the teeth, and the bulge of decomposition did not
obscure what the man’s initial impact must have been – handsome and open, his
now-waxen black eyes sly and convivial.  Say, good buddy, got a minute?  I see
you comin’ on the swing shift every day, don’t I?  Yeah, Joe Allen.  Look, I
know it’s late, you want to get home, tell the wife you ain’t been in there
drinkin’ since you got off, right?  Oh, yeah, I hear that.  But this damn
disappearance thing’s got me so edgy, and I’d swear to God just as I was coming
here I seen someone moving around back of that frame house up the street.  See
how the trees thin out a little down back of the yard, where the moonlight gets
in?  That’s right.  Well, I got me this little popper here.  Oh, yeah, that’s a
beauty, we’ll have it covered between us.  I knew I could spot a man ready for
some trouble – couldn’t find a patrol car anywhere on the street.  Yeah, just
down in there now, to that clump of pine.  Step careful, you can barely see. 
That’s right …</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The doctor’s
face ran with sweat.  He turned on his heel and walked out of the vault,
heaving the door shut behind him.  In the office’s greater warmth he felt the
perspiration soaking his shirt under the smock.  His stomach rasped with steady
oscillations of pain, but he scarcely attended it.  He went to Pollock and
seized up the post-mortem knife.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The work was done
with surreal speed, the laminae of flesh and bone recoiling smoothly beneath
his desperate but unerring hands, until the thoracic cavity lay exposed, and in
it, the vampire-stricken lungs, two gnarled lumps of grey tissue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He searched no
deeper, knowing what the heart and veins would show.  He returned to sit at the
desk, weakly drooping, the knife, forgotten, still in his left hand.  He looked
at his reflection in the window, and it seemed his thoughts originated with
that fainter, more tenuous Dr. Winters hanging like a ghost outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>What was this
world he lived in?  Surely, in a lifetime, he had not begun to guess.  To feed
in such a way!  There was horror enough in this alone.  But to feed thus <i>in
his own grave.</i>  How had he accomplished it – leaving aside how he had
fought suffocation long enough to do anything at all?  How was it to be
comprehended, a greed that raged so hotly it would glut itself at the very
threshold of its own destruction?  That last feast was surely in his stomach
still.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Dr. Winters
looked at the photograph, at Allen’s head snugged into the others’ middles like
a hungry suckling nuzzling to the sow.  Then he looked at the knife in his
hand.  The hand felt empty of all technique.  Its one impulse was to slash,
cleave, obliterate the remains of this gluttonous thing, this Joe Allen.  He
must do this, or flee it utterly.  There was no course between.  He did not
move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“I <i>will</i>
examine him,” said the ghost in the glass, and did not move.  Inside the
refrigeration vault, there was a slight noise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>No.  It had
been some hitch in the generator’s murmur.  Nothing in there could move.  There
was another noise, a brief friction against the vault’s inner wall.  The two
old men shook their heads at one another.  A catch clicked, and the metal door
slid open.  Behind the staring image of his own amazement, the doctor saw that
a filthy shape stood in the doorway and raised its arms toward him in a gesture
of supplication.  The doctor turned in his chair.  From the shape came a
whistling groan, the decayed fragment of a human voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Pleadingly, Joe
Allen worked his jaw and spread his purple hands.  As if speech were a maggot
struggling to emerge from his mouth, the blue tumescent face toiled, the huge
tongue wallowed helplessly between the viscid lips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The doctor
reached for the telephone, lifted the receiver.  Its deadness to his ear meant
nothing – he could not have spoken.  The thing confronting him, with each least
movement that it made, destroyed the very frame of sanity in which words might
have meaning, reduced the world itself around him to a waste of dark and
silence, a starlit ruin where already, everywhere, the alien and unimaginable
was awakening to its new dominion.  The corpse raised and reached out one hand
as if to stay him – turned, and walked toward the instrument table.  Its legs
were leaden, it rocked its shoulders like a swimmer, fighting to make its
passage through gravity’s dense medium.  It reached the table and grasped it
exhaustedly.  The doctor found himself on his feet, crouched slightly,
weightlessly still.  The knife in his hand was the only part of himself he
clearly felt, and it was like a tongue of fire, a crematory flame.  Joe Allen’s
corpse thrust one hand among the instruments.  The thick fingers, with a queer
simian ineptitude, brought up a scalpel.  Both hands clasped the little handle
and plunged the blade between the lips, as a thirsty child might a Popsicle,
then jerked it out again, slashing the tongue.  Turbid fluid splashed down to
the floor.  The jaw worked stiffly, the mouth brought out words in a wet ragged
hiss:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Please.  Help
me.  Trapped in <i>this</i>.”  One dead hand struck the dead chest. 
“Starving.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“What are you?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Traveller. 
Not of Earth.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“An eater of
human flesh.  A drinker of human blood.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“No.  No.  Hiding
only.  Am small.  Shape hideous to you.  Feared death.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“You brought
death.”  The doctor spoke with the calm of perfect disbelief, himself as
incredible to him as the thing he spoke with.  It shook its head, the dull,
popped eyes glaring with an agony of thwarted expression.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Killed none. 
Hid in this.  Hid in this not to be killed.  Five days now.  Drowning in
decay.  Free me.  Please.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“No.  You have
come to feed on us, you are not hiding in fear.  We are your food, your meat
and drink.  You fed on those two men within your grave.  <i>Their</i> grave. 
For you, a delay.  In fact, a diversion that has ended the hunt for you.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“No!  No!  Used
men already dead.  For me, five days, starvation.  Even less.  Fed only from
need.  Horrible necessity!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The spoiled vocal
instrument made a mangled gasp of the last word – an inhuman snake-pit noise
the doctor felt as a cold flicker of ophidian tongues within his ears – while
the dead arms moved in a sodden approximation of the body language that swears
truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“No,” the doctor
said.  “You killed them all.  Including your … tool – this man.  <i>What are
you?</i>”  Panic erupted in the question that he tried to bury by answering
himself instantly.  “Resolute, yes.  That surely.  You used death for an escape
route.  You need no oxygen perhaps.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Extracted more
than my need from gasses of decay.  A lesser component of our metabolism.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The voice was
gaining distinctness, developing makeshifts for tones lost in the agonal
rupturing of the valves and stops of speech, more effectively wrestling vowel
and consonant from the putrid tongue and lips.  At the same time the body’s
crudity of movement did not quite obscure a subtle, incessant experimentation. 
Fingers flexed and stirred, testing the give of tendons, groping the palm for
old points of purchase and counterpressure there.  The knees, with cautious
repetitions, assessed the new limits of their articulation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“What was the
sphere?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“My ship.  Its
destruction our first duty facing discovery.”  (Fear touched the doctor, like a
slug climbing his neck; he had seen, as it spoke, a sharp spastic activity of
the tongue, a pleating and shrinkage of its bulk at the tug of some inward
adjustment.)  “No chance to re-enter.  Leaving this body takes far too long. 
Not even time to set it for destruct – must extrude a cilium, chemical key to
broach hull shield.  In shaft was my only chance to halt my host.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Though the dead
mask hung expressionless, conveyed no irony, the thing’s articulacy grew
uncannily – each word more smoothly shaped, nuances of tone creeping into its
speech.  Its right arm tested its wrist as it spoke, and the scalpel the hand
still held cut white sparks from the air, while the word <i>host</i> seemed
itself a little razor-cut, an almost teasing abandonment of fiction preliminary
to attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>But the doctor
found that fear had gone from him.  The impossibility with which he conversed,
and was about to struggle, was working in him an overwhelming amplification of
his life’s long helpless rage at death.  He found his parochial pity for Earth
alone stretched to the transstellar scope this traveller commanded, to the
whole cosmic trash yard with its bulldozed multitudes of corpses; galactic
wheels of carnage – stars, planets with their most majestic generations – all
trash, cracked bones and foul rags that pooled, settled, reconcatenated in
futile symmetries gravid with new multitudes of briefly animate trash.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>And this,
standing before him now, was the death it was given him particularly to deal –
his mite was being called in by the universal Treasury of Death, and Dr.
Winters found himself, an old healer, on fire to pay.  His own, more lethal,
blade tugged at his hand with its own sharp appetite.  He felt entirely the
Examiner once more, knew the precise cuts he would make, swiftly and without error. 
<i>Very soon now</i>, he thought and coolly probed for some further insight
before its onslaught:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Why must your
ship be destroyed, even at the cost of your host’s life?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“We must not be
understood.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“The livestock
must not understand what is devouring them.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Yes, Doctor. 
Not all at once.  But one by one.  You will understand what is devouring you. 
That is essential to my feast.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The doctor
shook his head.  “You are in your grave already, Traveller.  That body will be
your coffin.  You will be buried in it a second time, for all time.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The thing came
one step nearer and opened its mouth.  The flabby throat wrestled as with
speech, but what sprang out was a slender white filament, more than whip-fast. 
Dr. Winters saw only the first flicker of its eruption, and then his brain
nova-ed, thinning out at light-speed to a white nullity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>When the doctor came to himself, it
was in face to a part of himself only.  Before he had opened his eyes he found
that his wakened mind had repossessed proprioceptively only a bizarre
truncation of his body.  His head, neck, left shoulder, arm, and hand declared
themselves – the rest was silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>When he opened his eyes, he found
that he lay supine on the gurney, and naked.  Something propped his head.  A
strap bound his left elbow to the gurney’s edge, a strap he could feel.  His
chest was also anchored by a strap, and this he could not feel.  Indeed, save
for its active remnant, his entire body might have been bound in a block of
ice, so numb was it, and so powerless was he to compel the slightest movement
from the least part of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The room was
empty, but from the open door of the vault there came slight sounds: the creak
and soft frictions of heavy tarpaulin shifted to accommodate some business
involving small clicking and kissing noises.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Tears of fury
filled the doctor’s eyes.  Clenching his one fist at the starry engine of
creation that he could not see, he ground his teeth and whispered in the hot
breath of strangled weeping:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Take it back,
this dirty little shred of life!  I throw it off gladly like the filth it is.” 
The slow knock of boot soles loudened from within the vault, and he turned his
head.  From the vault door Joe Allen’s corpse approached him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>It moved with
new energy, though its gait was grotesque, a ducking, hitching progress, jerky
with circumventions of decayed muscle, while above this galvanised, struggling
frame, the bruise-coloured face hung inanimate, an image of detachment.  With
terrible clarity the thing was revealed for what it was – a damaged hand-puppet
vigorously worked from within.  And when that frozen face was brought to hang
above the doctor, the reeking hands, with the light, solicitous touch of
friends at sickbeds, rested on his naked thigh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The absence of
sensation made the touch more dreadful than it felt.  It showed him that the
nightmare he still desperately denied at heart had annexed his body while he –
holding head and arm free – had already more than half-drowned in its mortal
paralysis.  There, from his chest on down, lay his nightmare’s part, a
nothingness freely possessed by an unspeakability.  The corpse said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Rotten blood. 
Thin nourishment.  I had only one hour alone before you came.  I fed from my
neighbour to my left – barely had strength to extend a siphon.  Fed from the
right while you worked.  Tricky going – you are alert.  I expected Dr.
Parsons.  The energy needs of animating this” – one hand left the doctor’s
thigh and smote the dusty overalls – “and of host-transfer, very high.  Once I
have you synapsed, I will be near starvation again.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>A sequence of
unbearable images unfolded in the doctor’s mind, even as the robot carrion
turned from the gurney and walked to the instrument table: the sheriff’s
arrival just after dawn, alone of course, since Craven always took thought for
his deputies’ rest and because on this errand he would want privacy to consider
any indiscretion on behalf of the miners’ survivors that the situation might
call for; Craven’s finding his old friend, supine and alarmingly weak; his
hurrying over, his leaning near.  Then, somewhat later, a police car containing
a rack of still wet bones might plunge off the highway above some deep spot in
the gorge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The corpse took
an evidence box from the table and put the scalpel in it.  Then he turned and
retrieved the mortuary knife from the floor and put that in as well, saying as
it did so, without turning, “The sheriff will come in the morning.  You spoke
like close friends.  He will probably come alone.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The coincidence
with his thoughts had to be accident, but the intent to terrify and appal him
was clear.  The tone and timing of that patched-up voice were unmistakably
deliberate – sly probes that sought his anguish specifically, sought his mind’s
personal centre.  He watched the corpse – over at the table – dipping an apish
but accurate hand and plucking up rib shears, scissors, clamps, adding all to
the box.  He stared, momentarily emptied by shock of all but the will to know
finally the full extent of the horror that had appropriated his life.  Joe
Allen’s body carried the box to the worktable beside the gurney, and the
expressionless eyes met the doctor’s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“I have
gambled.  A grave gamble.  But now I have won.  At risk of personal discovery
we are obliged to disconnect, contract, hide as well as possible in the host-body. 
Suicide in effect.  I disregarded situational imperatives, despite starvation
before disinterment and subsequent autopsy being all but certain.  I caught up
with the crew, tackled Pollock and Jackson microseconds before the blast.  I
computed five days’ survival from this cache.  I could disconnect at limit of
my strength to do so, but otherwise I would chance autopsy, knowing the doctor
was an alcoholic incompetent.  And now see my gain.  You are a prize host. 
Through you I can feed with near impunity even when killing is too dangerous. 
Safe meals are delivered to you still warm.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The corpse had
painstakingly aligned the gurney parallel to the worktable but offset, the
table’s foot extending past the gurney’s, and separated from it by a distance
somewhat less than the reach of Joe Allen’s right arm.  Now the dead hands
distributed the implements along the right edge of the table, save for the
scissors and the box.  These the corpse took to the table’s foot, where it set
down the box and slid the scissors’ jaws round one strap of its overalls.  It
began to speak again, and as it did, the scissors dismembered its cerements in
unhesitating strokes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“The cut must
be medical, forensically right, though a smaller one is easier.  I must be
careful of the pectoral muscles or these arms will not convey me.  I am no
larva anymore – over fifteen hundred grams.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>To ease the
nightmare’s suffocating pressure, to thrust out some flicker of his own will
against its engulfment, the doctor flung a question, his voice more cracked
than the other’s now was:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Why is my arm
free?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“The last, fine
neural splicing needs a sensory-motor standard, to perfect my brain’s fit to
yours.  Lacking this eye-hand co-ordinating check, only a much coarser control
of the host’s characteristic motor patterns is possible.  This done, I flush
out the paralytic, unbind us, and we are free together.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The
grave-clothes had fallen in a puzzle of fragments, and the cadaver stood naked,
its dark gas-rounded contours making it seem some sleek marine creature,
ruddered with the black-veined, gas-distended sex.  Again the voice had teased
for his fear, had uttered the last word with a savouring protraction, and now
the doctor’s cup of anguish brimmed over; horror and outrage wrenched his
spirit in brutal alternation as if trying to tear it naked from its captive
frame.  He rolled his head in this deadlock, his mouth beginning to split with
the slow birth of a mind-emptying outcry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The corpse
watched this, giving a single nod that might have been approbation.  Then it
mounted the worktable and, with the concentrated caution of some practised
convalescent re-entering his bed, lay on its back.  The dead eyes again sought
the living and found the doctor staring back, grinning insanely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Clever
corpse!” the doctor cried.  “Clever, carnivorous corpse!  Able alien!  Please
don’t think I’m criticising.  Who am I to criticise?  A mere arm and shoulder,
a talking head, just a small piece of a pathologist.  But I’m confused.”  He
paused, savouring the monster’s attentive silence and his own buoyancy in the
hysterical levity that had unexpectedly liberated him.  “You’re going to use
your puppet there to pluck you out of itself and put you on me.  But once he’s
pulled you from your driver’s seat, won’t he go dead, so to speak, and drop
you?  You could get a nasty knock.  Why not set a plank between the tables –
the puppet opens the door and you scuttle, ooze, lurch, flop, slither, as the
case may be, across the bridge.  No messy spills.  And in any case, isn’t this
an odd, rather clumsy way to get around among your cattle?  Shouldn’t you at
least carry your own scalpels when you travel?  There’s always the risk you’ll
run across that one host in a million that isn’t carrying one with him.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He knew his
gibes would be answered to his own despair.  He exulted, but solely in the
momentary bafflement of the predator – in having, for just a moment, mocked its
gloating assurance to silence and marred its feast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Its right hand
picked up the post-mortem knife beside it, and the left wedged a roll of gauze
beneath Allen’s neck, lifting the throat to a more prominent arch.  The mouth
told the ceiling:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“We retain
larval form till entry of the host.  As larvae we have locomotor structures,
and sense buds usable outside our ships’ sensory amplifiers.  I waited coiled
round Joe Allen’s bed leg till night, entered by his mouth as he slept.” 
Allen’s hand lifted the knife, held it high above the dull, quick eyes, turning
it in the light.  “Once lodged, we have three instars to adult form,” the voice
continued absently – the knife might have been a mirror from which the corpse
read its features.  “Larvally we have only a sketch of our full neural tap. 
Our metamorphosis is cued and determined by the host’s endosomatic ecology.  I
matured in three days.”  Allen’s wrist flexed, tipping the knife’s point
downmost.  “Most supreme adaptations are purchased at the cost of inessential
capacities.”  The elbow pronated and slowly flexed, hooking the knife
bodyward.  “Our hosts are all sentients, ecodominants, are already carrying the
baggage of coping structures for the planetary environment we find them in. 
Limbs, sensory portals” – the fist planted the fang of its tool under the chin,
tilted it and rode it smoothly down the throat, the voice proceeding unmarred
from under the furrow that the steel ploughed – “somatic envelopes,
instrumentalities” – down the sternum, diaphragm, abdomen the stainless blade
painted its stripe of gaping, muddy tissue – “with a host’s brain we inherit
all these, the mastery of our planet, netted in its dominant’s cerebral nexus. 
Thus our genetic codings are now all but disencumbered of such provisions.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>So swiftly that
the doctor flinched, Joe Allen’s hand slashed four lateral cuts from the great
wound’s axis.  The seeming butchery left two flawlessly drawn thoracic flaps
cleanly outlined.  The left hand raised the left flap’s hem, and the right
coaxed the knife into the aperture, deepening it with small stabs and slices. 
The posture was a man’s who searches a breast pocket, with the dead eyes
studying the slow recoil of flesh.  The voice, when it resumed, had geared up
to an intenser pitch:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Galactically,
the chordate nerve/brain paradigm abounds, and the neural labyrinth is our
dominion.  Are we to make plank bridges and worm across them to our food?  Are
cockroaches greater than we for having legs to run up walls and antennae to
grope their way?  All the quaint, hinged crutches that life sports!  The
stilts, fins, fans, springs, stalks, flippers, and feathers, all in turn so
variously terminating in hooks, clamps, suckers, scissors, forks, or little
cages of digits!  And besides all the gadgets it concocts for wrestling through
its worlds, it is all knobbed, whiskered, crested, plumed, vented, spiked, or
measled over with perceptual gear for combing pittances of noise or colour from
the environing plenitude.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Invincibly calm
and sure, the hands traded tool and tasks.  The right flap eased back,
revealing ropes of ingeniously spared muscle while promising a genuine
appearance once sutured back in place.  Helplessly the doctor felt his
delirious defiance bleed away and a bleak fascination rebind him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“We are the
taps and relays that share the host’s aggregate of afferent nerve-impulses
precisely at its nodes of integration.  We are the brains that peruse these
integrations, integrate them with our existing banks of host-specific data, and
lastly, let their consequences flow down the motor pathway – either the
consequences they seek spontaneously, or those we wish to graft upon them.  We
are besides a streamlined alimentary/circulatory system and a reproductive
apparatus.  And more than this we need not be.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The corpse had
spread its bloody vest, and the feculent hands now took up the rib shears.  The
voice’s sinister coloration of pitch and stress grew yet more marked – the
phrases slid from the tongue with a cobra’s seeking sway, winding their liquid
rhythms round the doctor till a gap in his resistance should let them pour
through to slaughter the little courage left him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“For in this
form we have inhabited the densest brainweb of three hundred races, lain
intricately snug within them like thriving vine on trelliswork.  We’ve looked
out from too many variously windowed masks to regret our vestigial senses. 
None read their worlds definitively.  Far better then our nomad’s range and
choice than an unvarying tenancy of one poor set of structures.  Far better to
slip on as we do whole living beings and wear at once all of their limbs and
organs, memories and powers – wear all these as tightly congruent to our wills
as a glove is to the hand that fills it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The shears
clipped through the gristle, stolid, bloody jaws monotonously feeding, stopping
short of the sternoclavicular joint in the manubrium where the muscles of the
pectoral girdle have an important anchorage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“No
consciousness of the chordate type that we have found has been impermeable to
our finesse – no dendritic pattern so elaborate we could not read its
stitchwork and thread ourselves to match, precisely map its each synaptic seam
till we could loosen it and retailor all to suit ourselves.  We have strutted
costumed in the bodies of planetary autarchs, venerable manikins of moral
fashion, but cut of the universal cloth: the weave of fleet electric filaments
of experience that we easily reshuttled to the warp of our wishes.  Whereafter
– newly hemmed and gathered – their living fabric hung obedient to our bias,
investing us with honour and influence unlimited.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The tricky
verbal melody, through the corpse’s deft, unfaltering self-dismemberment – the
sheer neuromuscular orchestration of the compound activity – struck Dr. Winters
with the detached enthralment great keyboard performers could bring him.  He
glimpsed the alien’s perspective – a Gulliver waiting in a Brobdingnagian grave,
then marshalling a dead giant against a living, like a dwarf in a huge
mechanical crane, feverishly programming combat on a battery of levers and
pedals, waiting for the robot arms’ enactments, the remote, titanic impact of
the foes – and he marvelled, filled with a bleak wonder at life’s infinite
strategy and plasticity.  Joe Allen’s hands reached into his half-opened
abdominal cavity, reached deep below the uncut anterior muscle that was exposed
by the shallow, spurious incision of the epidermis, till by external measure
they were extended far enough to be touching his thighs.  The voice was still
as the forearms advertised a delicate rummaging with the buried fingers.  The
shoulders drew back.  As the steady withdrawal brought the wrists into view,
the dead legs tremored and quaked with diffuse spasms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“You called
your kind our food and drink, Doctor.  If you were merely that, an elementary
usurpation of your motor tracts alone would satisfy us, give us perfect
cattle-control – for what rarest word or subtlest behaviour is more than a
flurry of varied muscles?  That trifling skill was ours long ago.  It is not
mere blood that feeds this lust I feel now to tenant you, this craving for an
intimacy that years will not stale.  My truest feast lies in compelling you to
feed in that way.  Had gross nourishment been my prime need, then my
grave-mates – Pollock and Jackson  - could have eked out two weeks of life for
me or more.  But I scorned a cowardly parsimony in the face of death.  I
reinvested more than half the energy that their blood gave me in fabricating
chemicals to keep their brains alive, and fluid-bathed with oxygenated
nutriment.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The corpse
reached into its gaping abdomen, and out of its cloven groin the smeared hands
pulled two long skeins of silvery filament.  The material looked like masses of
nerve fibre, tough and scintillant – for the weave of it glittered with a
slight incessant movement of each single thread.  These nerve skeins were
contracting.  They thickened into two swollen nodes, while at the same time the
corpse’s legs tremored and faintly twitched, as the bright vermiculate roots of
the parasite withdrew from within Allen’s musculature.  When the nodes lay
fully contracted – the doctor could just see their tips within the abdomen –
then the legs lay still as death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“I had
accessory neural taps only to spare, but I could access much memory, and all of
their cognitive responses, and having in my banks all the organ of Corti’s
electrochemical conversions of English words, I could whisper anything to them
directly into the eighth cranial nerve.  Those are our true feast, Doctor, such
bodiless electric storms of impotent cognition as I tickled up in those two
little bone globes.  I was forced to drain them just before disinterment, but they
lived till then and understood everything – <i>everything</i> I did to them.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>When the voice
paused, the dead and living eyes were locked together.  They remained so a
moment, and then the dead face smiled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>It
recapitulated all the horror of Allen’s first resurrection – this waking of
expressive soul in that purple death mask.  And it was a demon-soul the doctor
saw awaken: the smile was barbed with fine, sharp hooks of cruelty at the
corners of the mouth, while the barbed eyes beamed fond, languorous anticipation
of his pain.  Remotely, Dr. Winters heard the flat sound of his own voice
asking:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“And Joe
Allen?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Oh, yes,
Doctor.  He is with us now, has been throughout.  I grieve to abandon so rare a
host!  He is a true hermit-philosopher, well-read in four languages.  He is
writing a translation of Marcus Aurelius – he was, I mean, in his free time …”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Long minutes
succeeded of the voice accompanying the surreal self-autopsy, but the doctor
lay resigned, emptied of reactive power.  Still, the full understanding of his
fate reverberated in his mind as the parasite sketched his future for him in
that borrowed voice.  And it did not stop haunting Winters, the sense of what a
<i>virtuoso</i> this entity was, how flawlessly this mass of neural fibres
played the tricky instrument of human speech.  As flawlessly as it had
puppeteered the corpse’s face into that ghastly smile.  And with the same
artistic aim: to waken, to amplify, to ripen its host-to-be’s outrage and
horror.  The voice, with ever more melody and gloating verve, sent waves of
realisation through the doctor, amplifications of the Unspeakable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The parasite’s
race had traced and tapped the complex interface between the cortical
integration of sense input and the neural output governing response.  It had
interposed its brain between, sharing consciousness while solely commanding the
pathways of reaction.  The host, the bottled personality, was mute and limbless
for any least expression of its own will, while hellishly articulate and agile
in the service of the parasite’s.  It was the host’s own hands that bound and
wrenched the life half out of its prey, his own loins that experienced the
repeated orgasms crowning his other despoliations of their bodies.  And when
they lay, bound and shrieking still, ready for the consummation, it was his own
strength that hauled the smoking entrails from them, and his own intimate
tongue and guzzling mouth he plunged into the rank, palpitating feast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>And the doctor
had glimpses of the racial history that underlay the aliens’ predatory present. 
Glimpses of a dispassionate, inquiring breed so advanced in the analysis of its
own mental fabric that, through scientific commitment and genetic
self-sculpting, it had come to embody its own model of perfected
consciousness.  It had grown streamlined to permit its entry of other beings
and its direct acquisition of their experiential worlds.  All strictest
scholarship at first, until their matured in the disembodied scholars their
long-germinal and now blazing, jealous hatred for all ‘lesser’ minds rooted and
clothed in the soil and sunlight of solid particular worlds.  The parasite
spoke of the ‘cerebral music,’ the ‘symphonies of agonised paradox’ that were
its invasion’s chief plunder.  The doctor felt the truth behind this
grandiloquence: the parasite’s actual harvest from the systematic violation of
encoffined personalities was the experience of a barren supremacy of means over
lives more primitive, perhaps, but vastly wealthier in the vividness and
passionate concern with which life for them was imbued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The corpse had
reached into its thorax and with its dead hands aided the parasite’s retraction
of its upper-body root system.  More and more of its livid mass had gone dead,
until only its head and the arm nearer the doctor remained animate, while the
silvery worming mass grew in its bleeding abdominal nest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>Then Joe Allen’s face grinned, and
his hands hoisted up the nude, regathered parasite from his sundered gut and
held it for the doctor to view – his tenant-to-be.  Winters saw that from the squirming
mass of nerve cord one thick filament still draped down, remaining anchored in
the canyoned chest toward the upper spine.  This, he understood, would be the
remote-control line by which it could work at a distance the crane of its old
host’s body, transferring itself to Winters by means of a giant apparatus it no
longer inhabited.  This, he knew, was his last moment.  Before his own personal
horror should begin, and engulf him, he squarely met the corpse’s eyes and
said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Goodbye, Joe
Allen.  Eddie Sykes, I mean.  I hope he gave you strength, the Golden Marcus. 
I love him too.  You are guiltless.  Peace be with you at last.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The demon smile
stayed fixed, but, effortlessly, Winters looked through it to the real eyes,
those of the encoffined man.  Tormented eyes foreseeing death and craving it. 
The grinning corpse reached out its viscid cargo – a seething, rippling,
multinodular lump that completely filled the erstwhile logger’s roomy palm.  It
reached this across and laid it on the doctor’s groin.  He watched the hand set
the bright medusa’s head – his new self – on his own skin, but felt nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He watched the
dead hand return to the table, take up the scalpel, reach back over, and make a
twelve-inch incision up his abdomen, along his spinal axis.  It was a deep,
slow cut – now sectioning, just straight down through the abdominal wall – and
it proceeded in the eerie, utter absence of physical sensation.  The moment
this was done, the fibre that had stayed anchored in the corpse snapped free,
whipped back across the gap, and rejoined the main body that now squirmed
toward the incision, its port of entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The corpse
collapsed.  Emptied of all innervating energy, it sagged slack and flaccid, of
course.  Or had it …?  Why was it …?  That nearer arm was <i>supinated</i>. 
Both elbow and wrist at the full upturned twist.  The palm lay open, offering. 
<i>The scalpel still lay in the palm</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Simple death
would have dropped the arm earthward, it would now hang slack.  With a blaze,
like a nova of light, Winters understood.  The man, Sykes, had – for a
microsecond before his end – repossessed himself.  Had flung a dying impulse of
<i>his</i> will down through his rotten, fading muscles and had managed a
single independent gesture in the narrow interval between the demon’s departure
and his own death.  He had clutched the scalpel and flung out his arm, locking
the joints as life left him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>It rekindled
Winters’s own will, lit a fire of rage and vengefulness.  He had caught hope
from his predecessor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>How
precariously the scalpel lay on the loosened fingers!  The slightest tremor
would unfix the arm’s joints, it would fall and hang and drop the scalpel down
farther than Hell’s deepest recess from his grasp.  And he could see that the
scalpel was just – only just – in the reach of his fingers at his forearm’s
fullest stretch from the bound elbow.  The horror crouched on him and, even now
slowly feeding its trunk line into his groin incision, at first stopped the
doctor’s hand with a pang of terror.  Then he reminded himself that, until implanted,
the enemy was a senseless mass, bristling with plugs, with input jacks for
senses, but, until installed in the physical amplifiers of eyes and ears, an
utterly deaf, blind monad that waited in a perfect solipsism between two
captive sensory envelopes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He saw his
straining fingers above the bright tool of freedom, thought with an insane
smile of God and Adam on the Sistine ceiling, and then, with a life span of
surgeon’s fine control, plucked up the scalpel.  The arm fell and hung.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Sleep,” the
doctor said.  “Sleep revenged.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>But he found
his retaliation harshly reined-in by the alien’s careful provisions.  His elbow
had been fixed with his upper arm almost at right angles to his body’s long
axis; his forearm could reach his hand inward and present it closely to the
face, suiting the parasite’s need of an eye-hand co-ordinative check, but could
not, even with the scalpel’s added reach, bring its point to within four inches
of his groin.  Steadily the parasite fed in its tapline.  It would usurp motor
control in three or four minutes at most, to judge by the time its extrication
from Allen had taken.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Frantically the
doctor bent his wrist inward to its limit, trying to pick through the strap
where it crossed his inner elbow.  Sufficient pressure was impossible, and the
hold so awkward that even feeble attempts threatened the loss of the scalpel. 
Smoothly the root of alien control sank into him.  It was a defenceless thing
of jelly against which he lay lethally armed, and he was still doomed – a
preview of all his thrall’s impotence-to-be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>But of course
there was a way.  Not to survive.  But to escape, and to have vengeance.  For a
moment he stared at his captor, hardening his mettle in the blaze of hate it
lit in him.  Then, swiftly, he determined the order of his moves, and began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He reached the
scalpel to his neck and opened his superior thyroid vein – his inkwell.  He
laid the scalpel to his ear, dipped his finger in his blood, and began to write
on the metal surface of the gurney, beginning by his thigh and moving toward
his armpit.  Oddly, the incision of his neck, though this was muscularly awake,
had been painless, which gave him hopes that raised his courage for what
remained to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>When he had
done the message read:</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN-GB>He went to write goodbye to his
friend, but the alien had begun to pay out smaller auxiliary filaments
collaterally with the main one, and all now lay in speed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>He took up the
scalpel, rolled his head to the left, and plunged the blade deep in his ear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>Miracle!  Last
accidental mercy!  It was painless.  Some procedural, highly specific
anaesthetic was in effect.  With careful plunges, he obliterated the right
inner ear and then thrust silence, with equal thoroughness, into the left.  The
slashing of the vocal cords followed, then the tendons in the back of the neck
that hold it erect.  He wished he were free to unstring knees and elbows too,
but it could not be.  But blinded, deaf, with centres of balance lost, with
only rough motor control – all these conditions should fetter the alien’s
escape, should it in the first place manage the reanimation of a bloodless
corpse in which it had not yet achieved a fine-tuned interweave.  Before he
extinguished his eyes, he paused, the scalpel poised above his face, and
blinked them to clear his aim of tears.  The right, then the left, both retinas
meticulously carved away, the yolk of vision quite scooped out of them.  The
scalpel’s last task, once it had tilted the head sideways to guide the blood
flow absolutely clear of possible effacement of the message, was to slash the
external carotid artery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>When this was
done, the old man sighed with relief and laid his scalpel down.  Even as he did
so, he felt the deep inward prickle of alien energy – something that flared,
crackled, flared, <i>groped for</i>, but did not quite find its purchase.  And
inwardly, as the doctor sank toward sleep – cerebrally, as a voiceless man must
speak – he spoke to the parasite these carefully chosen words:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>“Welcome to
your new house.  I’m afraid there’s been some vandalism – the light’s don’t
work, and the plumbing has a very bad leak.  There are some other things wrong
as well – the neighbourhood is perhaps a little <i>too</i> quiet, and you may
find it hard to get around very easily.  But it’s been a lovely home for me for
fifty-seven years, and somehow I think you’ll stay …”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.45pt'><span lang=EN-GB>The face,
turned toward the body of Joe Allen, seemed to weep scarlet tears, but its last
movement before death was to smile.</span></p>
