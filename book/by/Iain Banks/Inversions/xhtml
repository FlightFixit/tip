<h3 class="chapter">PROLOGUE</h3>

<p>The only sin is selfishness. So said the good Doctor. When she
first expressed this opinion I was young enough initially to be
puzzled and then to be impressed at what I took to be her
profundity.</p>

<p>It was only later, in my middle-age, when she was long gone from
us, that I began to suspect that the opposite is just as true.
Arguably there is a sense in which selfishness is the only true
virtue, and therefore that &mdash; as opposites are given to cancelling
each other out &mdash; selfishness is finally neutral, indeed valueless,
outside a supporting moral context. In later years still &mdash; my
maturity, if you will, or my old age, if you wish &mdash; I have with
some reluctance again come to respect the Doctor's point of view,
and to agree with her, tentatively at least, that selfishness is
the root of most evil, if not all.</p>

<p>Of course I always knew what she meant. That it is when we put
our own interests before those of others that we are most likely to
do wrong, and that there is a commonality of guilt whether the
crime is that of a child stealing coins from his mother's purse or
an Emperor ordering genocide. With either act, and all those in
between, we say: Our gratification matters more to us than whatever
distress or anguish may be caused to you and yours by our actions.
In other words, that our desire outranks your suffering.</p>

<p>My middle-years objection was that only by acting on our
desires, by attempting to bring about what pleases us because it
feels agreeable, are we able to create wealth, comfort, happiness
and what the good Doctor would have termed in that vague,
generalising way of hers 'progress'.</p>

<p>Eventually, though, I came to admit to myself that, while my
objection might be true, it is insufficiently all-embracing to
cancel out the Doctor's assertion entirely, and that while it may
sometimes be a virtue, selfishness by its nature is more often a
sin, or a direct cause of sin.</p>

<p>We never like to think of ourselves as being wrong, just
misunderstood. We never like to think that we are sinning, merely
that we are making hard decisions, and acting upon them. Providence
is the name of the mystical, divinely inhuman Court before which we
wish our actions to be judged, and which we hope will agree with us
in our estimation both of our own worth and the culpability or
otherwise of our behaviour.</p>

<p>I suspect the good Doctor (you see, I judge her too in naming
her so) did not believe in Providence. I was never entirely sure
what she did believe in, though I was always quite convinced that
she believed in something. Perhaps, despite all she said about
selfishness, she believed in herself and nothing else. Perhaps she
believed in this Progress that she talked about, or perhaps in some
strange way, as a foreigner, she believed in us, in the people she
lived with and cared for, in a way that we did not believe in
ourselves.</p>

<p>Did she leave us better off or not? I think, undeniably, better.
Did she do this through selfishness or selflessness? I believe that
in the end it does not matter in the least, except as it might have
affected her own peace of mind. That was another thing she taught
me. That you are what you do. To Providence &mdash; or Progress or the
Future or before any other sort of judgment apart from our own
conscience &mdash; what we have done, not what we have thought, is the
result we are judged by.</p>

<p>So, the following is the collected chronicle of our deeds. One
part of my tale is presented as something I can vouch for, for I
was there. As to the other part, I cannot confirm its veracity. I
stumbled across its original version by sheer chance, long after
the events described in it had taken place, and while I believe it
forms an interesting counterpoint to the story in which I was
involved, I present it more as an artistic flourish than as a
judgment born of intense study and reflection. Nevertheless, I
believe the two tales belong together, and carry more weight united
than they could separately. It was, I think there is no doubt, a
crucial time. Geographically the crux was divided, but &mdash; after all
 &mdash; much was, then. Division was the only order.</p>

<p>I have tried in what I have written here not to judge, yet I
confess that I hope the Reader &mdash; a sort of partial Providence,
perhaps &mdash; will do just that, and not think badly of us. I freely
admit that a specific of my motive (especially in amending and
adding to my earlier self's chronicle, as well as in refining the
language and grammar of my co-teller) is to try to make sure that
the Reader will not think ill of me, and of course that is a
selfish desire. Yet still I would hope that such selfishness might
lead to good, for the simple reason that otherwise this chronicle
might not exist.</p>

<p>Again, the Reader must decide whether that would have been the
more fortunate outcome, or not.</p>

<p>Enough. A young and rather earnest man wishes to address us:</p>

<h3 class="chapter">1. THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p>Master, it was in the evening of the third day of the southern
planting season that the questioner's assistant came for the Doctor
to take her to the hidden chamber, where the chief torturer
awaited.</p>

<p>I was sitting in the living room of the Doctor's apartments
using a pestle and mortar to grind some ingredients for one of the
Doctor's potions. Concentrating on this, it took me a moment or two
fully to collect my wits when I heard the loud and aggressive
knocking at the door, and I upset a small censer on my way to the
door. This was the cause both of the delay in opening the door and
any curses which Unoure, the questioner's assistant, may have
heard. These swear-words were not directed at him, neither was I
asleep or even remotely groggy, as I trust my good Master will
believe, no matter what the fellow Unoure &mdash; a shifty and unreliable
person, by all accounts &mdash; may say.</p>

<p>The Doctor was in her study, as was usual at that time in the
evening. I entered the Doctor's workshop, where she keeps the two
great cabinets containing the powders, creams, ointments, draughts
and various instruments that are the stock of her trade as well as
the pair of tables which support a variety of burners, stoves,
retorts and flasks. Occasionally she treats patients in here too,
when it becomes her surgery, While the unpleasant-smelling Unoure
waited in the living room, wiping his nose on his already filthy
sleeve and peering round with the look of one choosing what to
steal, I went through the workshop and tapped at the door to the
study which also serves as her bedroom.</p>

<p>'Oelph?' the Doctor asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, mistress.'</p>

<p>'Come in.'</p>

<p>I heard the quiet thud of a heavy book being closed, and smiled
to myself.</p>

<p>The Doctor's study was dark and smelled of the sweet istra
flower whose leaves she habitually burned in roof-hung censers. I
felt my way through the gloom. Of course I know the arrangement of
the Doctor's study intimately &mdash; better than she might imagine,
thanks to the inspired foresight and judicious cunning of my Master
 &mdash; but the Doctor is prone to leaving chairs, stools and shelf-steps
lying where one might walk, and accordingly I had to feel my way
across the room to where a small candle flame indicated her
presence, sitting at her desk in front of a heavily curtained
window. She sat upright in her chair, stretching her back and
rubbing her eyes. The hand-thick, fore-arm-square bulk of her
journal lay on the desk in front of her. The great book was closed
and locked, but even in that cave-darkness I noticed that the
little chain on the hasp was swinging to and fro. A pen stood in
the ink well, whose cap was open. The Doctor yawned and adjusted
the fine chain round her neck which holds the key for the
journal.</p>

<p>My Master knows from my many previous reports that I believe the
Doctor may be writing an account of her experiences here in Haspide
to the people of her homeland in Drezen.</p>

<p>The Doctor obviously wishes to keep her writings secret.
However, sometimes she forgets that I am in the room, usually when
she has set me the task of tracking down some reference in one of
the books in her extravagantly endowed library and I have been
silently doing so for some time. From the little that I have been
able to glimpse of her writings on such occasions I have determined
that when she writes in her journal she does not always use
Haspidian or Imperial &mdash; though there are passages in both &mdash; but
sometimes uses an alphabet I have never seen before.</p>

<p>I believe my Master has thought of taking steps to check with
other natives of Drezen regarding whether, in such instances, the
Doctor writes in Drezeni or not, and to this end I am attempting to
commit to memory as much as I can of the Doctor's relevant journal
writings whenever I can. On this occasion, however, I was unable to
gain a view of the pages she had surely been working on.</p>

<p>It is still my wish to be able to serve my Master better in this
regard and I would respectfully again submit that the temporary
removal of her journal would allow a skilled locksmith to open the
journal without damaging it and a better copy of her secret
writings to be taken, so allowing the matter to be settled. This
could easily be done when the Doctor is elsewhere in the palace, or
better still, elsewhere in the city, or even when she is taking one
of her frequent baths, which tend to be prolonged (it was during
one of her baths that I procured for my Master one of the Doctor's
scalpels from her medicine bag, which has now been delivered. I
would add that I was careful to do this immediately after a visit
to the Poor Hospital, so that someone there would be suspected).
However, I do of course how to my Master's superior judgment in
this regard.</p>

<p>The Doctor frowned at me. 'You're shaking,' she said. And indeed
I was, for the sudden appearance of the torturer's assistant had
been undeniably unsettling. The Doctor glanced past me towards the
door to the surgery, which I had left open so that Unoure might be
able to hear our voices and so perhaps be dissuaded from any
mischief he might be contemplating. 'Who's that?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Who's what, mistress?' I asked, watching her close the cap of
the ink well.</p>

<p>'I heard somebody cough.'</p>

<p>'Oh, that is Unoure, the questioner's assistant, mistress. He's
come to fetch you.'</p>

<p>'To go where?'</p>

<p>'To the hidden chamber. Master Nolieti has sent for you.'</p>

<p>She looked at me without speaking for a moment. 'The chief
torturer,' she said evenly, and nodded. 'Am I in trouble, Oelph?'
she asked, laying one arm across the thick hide cover of her
journal, as if looking to provide, or gain, protection.</p>

<p>'Oh no,' I told her. 'You're to bring your bag. And medicines.'
I glanced round at the door to the surgery, edged with light from
the living room. A cough came from that direction, a cough that
sounded like the sort of cough one makes when one wants to remind
somebody that one is waiting impatiently. 'I think it's urgent,' I
whispered.</p>

<p>'Hmm. Do you think chief torturer Nolieti has a cold?'
the Doctor asked, rising from her chair and pulling on her long
jacket, which had been hanging on the back of the seat.</p>

<p>I helped her on with her black jacket. 'No, mistress, I think
there is probably somebody being put to the question who is, umm,
unwell.'</p>

<p>'I see,' she said, stamping her feet into her boots and then
straightening. I was struck again by the Doctor's physical
presence, as I often am. She is tall for a woman, though not
exceptionally so, and while for a female she is broad at the
shoulder I have seen fish-wives and net-women who look more
powerful. No, what seems most singular about her, I think, is her
carriage, the way she, comports herself.</p>

<p>I have been afforded tantalising half-glimpses of her &mdash; after
one of her many baths &mdash; in a thin shift with the light behind her,
stepping in a coil of powdered, scented air from one room to
another, her arms raised to secure a towel about her long, damp red
hair, and I have watched her during grand court occasions when she
has worn a formal gown and danced as lightly and delicately &mdash; and
with as demure an expression &mdash; as any expensively tutored
season-maiden, and I freely confess that I have found myself drawn
to her in a physical sense just as any man (youthful or not) might
be to a woman of such healthy and generous good looks. Yet at the
same time there is something about her deportment which I &mdash; and I
suspect most other males &mdash; find off-putting, and even slightly
threatening. A certain immodest forthrightness in her bearing is
the cause of this, perhaps, plus the suspicion that while she pays
flawless lip service to the facts of life which dictate the
accepted and patent preeminence of the male, she does so with a
sort of unwarranted humour, producing in us males the unsettlingly
contrary feeling that she is indulging us.</p>

<p>The Doctor leaned over the desk and opened the curtains and the
shutters to the mid-eve Seigen glow. In the faint wash of light
from the windows I noticed the small plate of biscuits and cheese
at the edge of the Doctor's desk, on the far side of the journal.
Her old, battered dagger lay also on the plate, its dull edges
smeared with grease.</p>

<p>She picked up the knife, licked its blade and then, after
smacking her lips as she gave it a final wipe on her kerchief,
slipped the dagger into the top of her right boot. 'Come on,' she
said, 'mustn't keep the chief torturer waiting.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Is this really necessary?' the Doctor asked, looking at the
blindfold held in questioner's assistant Unoure's grubby hands. He
wore a long butcher's apron of blood-stained hide over his filthy
shirt and loose, greasy-looking trousers. The black blindfold had
been produced from a long pocket in the leather apron.</p>

<p>Unoure grinned, displaying a miscellany of diseased, discoloured
teeth and dark gaps where teeth ought to have been. The Doctor
winced. Her own teeth are so even that the first time I saw them I
naturally assumed they were a particularly fine false set.</p>

<p>'Rules,' Unoure said, looking at the Doctor's chest. She drew
her long jacket closed across her shirt. 'You're a foreigner,' he
told her.</p>

<p>The Doctor sighed, glancing at me.</p>

<p>'A foreigner,' I told Unoure forcibly, 'who holds the King's
life in her hands almost every day.'</p>

<p>'Doesn't matter,' the fellow said, shrugging. He sniffed and
went to wipe his nose with the blindfold, then looked at the
expression on the Doctor's face and changed his mind, using his
sleeve again instead. 'That's the orders. Got to hurry,' he said,
glancing at the doors.</p>

<p>We were at the entrance to the palace's lower levels. The
corridor behind us led off from the little-used passage-way beyond
the west-wing kitchens and the wine cellars. It was quite dark. A
narrow circular light-well overhead cast a dusty sheen of slaty
light over us and the tall, rusted metal doors, while a couple of
candles burned dimly further down the corridor.</p>

<p>'Very well,' the Doctor said. She leaned over a little and made
a show of inspecting the blindfold and Unoure's hands. 'But I'm not
wearing that, and you're not tying it.' She turned to me and pulled
a fresh kerchief from a pocket in her coat. 'Here,' she said.</p>

<p>'But&mdash;' Unoure said, then jumped as a bell clanged somewhere
beyond the flaking brown doors. He turned away, stuffing the
blindfold into his apron, cursing.</p>

<p>I tied the scented kerchief across the Doctor's eyes while
Unoure unlocked the doors. I carried the Doctor's bag with one hand
and with my other hand led her into the corridor beyond the doors
and down the many twisting steps and further doors and passageways
to the hidden chamber where Master Nolieti waited. Halfway there,
the bell rang again from somewhere ahead of us, and I felt the
Doctor jump, and her hand become damp. I confess my own nerves were
not entirely settled.</p>

<p>We entered the hidden chamber from a low doorway we each had to
stoop under (I placed my hand on the Doctor's head to lower her
head. Her hair felt sleek and smooth). The place smelled of
something sharp and noxious, and of burned flesh. My breathing
seemed to be quite beyond my control, the odours forcing their way
into my nostrils and down into my lungs.</p>

<p>The tall, wide space was lit by a motley collection of ancient
oil lamps which threw a sickly blue-green glow over a variety of
vats, tubs, tables and other instruments and containers &mdash; some in
human shape &mdash; none of which I cared to inspect too closely, though
all of them attracted my wide-open eyes like suns attract flowers.
Additional light came from a tall brazier positioned underneath a
hanging cylindrical chimney. The brazier stood by a chair made from
hoops of iron which entirely enclosed a pale, thin and naked man,
who appeared to be unconscious. The entire frame of this chair had
been swivelled over on an outer cradle so that the man appeared
caught in the act of performing a forward somersault, resting on
his knees in mid-air, his back parallel with the grid of a broad
light-well grille above.</p>

<p>The chief torturer Nolieti stood between this apparatus and a
broad workbench covered with various metal bowls, jars and bottles
and a collection of instruments that might have originated in the
workplaces of a mason, a carpenter, a butcher and a surgeon.
Nolieti was shaking his broad, scarred grey head. His rough and
sinewy hands were on his hips and his glare was fastened on the
withered form of the encaged man. Below the metal contraption
enclosing the unfortunate fellow stood a broad square tray of stone
with a drain hole at one corner. Dark fluid like blood had
splattered there. Long white shapes in the darkness might have been
teeth.</p>

<p>Nolieti turned round when he heard us approach. 'About fucking
time,' he spat, fixing his stare on first me, then the Doctor and
then Unoure (who, I noticed, as the Doctor stuffed her kerchief
back into a pocket in her jacket, was making a show of folding the
black blindfold he had been told to use on her).</p>

<p>'My fault,' the Doctor said in a matter-of-fact manner, stepping
past Nolieti. She bent down at the man's rear. She grimaced, nose
wrinkling, then came to the side of the apparatus and with one hand
on the iron hoops of the frame-chair brought it squeaking and
complaining round until the man was in a more conventional sitting
position. The fellow looked in a terrible state. His face was grey,
his skin was burned in places, and his mouth and jaw had collapsed.
Little rivulets of blood had dried under each of his ears. The
Doctor put her hand through the iron hoops and tried to open one of
the man's eyes. He made a terrible, low groaning sound. There was a
sort of sucking, tearing noise and the man gave a plaintive moan
like a kind of distant scream before settling into a ragged,
rhythmic, bubbling noise that might have been breathing.</p>

<p>The Doctor bent forward to peer into the man's face and I heard
her give a small gasp.</p>

<p>Nolieti snorted. 'Looking for these?' he asked the Doctor, and
flourished a small bowl at her.</p>

<p>The Doctor barely glanced at the bowl, but smiled thinly at the
torturer. She rotated the iron chair to its previous position and
went back to look at the caged man's rear. She pulled away some
blood-soaked rags and gave another grimace. I thanked the gods that
he was pointing away from me and prayed that whatever the Doctor
might have to do would not require my assistance.</p>

<p>'What seems to be the problem?' the Doctor asked Nolieti, who
seemed momentarily nonplussed.</p>

<p>'Well,' the chief torturer said after a pause. 'He won't stop
bleeding out his arse, will he?'</p>

<p>The Doctor nodded. 'You must have let your pokers get too cold,'
she said casually, squatting and opening her bag and laying it by
the side of the stone drain-tray.</p>

<p>Nolieti went to the Doctor's side and bent down over her. 'How
it happened isn't any of your fucking business, woman,' he said
into her ear. 'Your business is to get this fucker well enough to
be questioned so he can tell us what the King needs to know.'</p>

<p>'<em>Does</em> the King know?' the Doctor asked, looking up, an
expression of innocent interest on her face. 'Did he order this?
Does he even know of the existence of this unfortunate? Or was it
guard commander Adlain who thought the Kingdom would fall unless
this poor devil suffered?'</p>

<p>Nolieti stood up. 'None of that is your business,' he said
sullenly. 'Just do your job and get out.' He bent down again and
stuck his mouth by her ear. 'And never you mind the King or the
guard commander. <em>I'm</em> king down here, and I say you'd best attend to
your own business and leave me to mine.'</p>

<p>'But it is my business,' the Doctor said evenly, ignoring the
threatening bulk of the man poised over her. 'If I know what was
done to him, and how it was done, I might be better able to treat
him.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I could <em>show</em> you, Doctor,' the chief torturer said, looking
up at his assistant and winking. 'And we have special treats we
save just for the ladies, don't we, Unoure?'</p>

<p>'Well, we haven't time to flirt,' the Doctor said with a steely
smile. 'Just tell me what you did to this poor wretch.'</p>

<p>Nolieti's eyes narrowed. He stood up and withdrew a poker from
the brazier in a cloud of sparks. Its yellow-glowing tip was broad,
like the blade of a small flat spade. 'Latterly, we did him with
this,' Nolieti said with a smile, his face lit by the soft
yellow-orange glow.</p>

<p>The Doctor looked at the poker, then at the torturer. She
squatted and touched something at the encaged man's rear.</p>

<p>'Was he bleeding badly?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Like a man pissing,' the chief torturer said, winking at his
assistant again. Unoure quickly nodded and laughed.</p>

<p>'Better leave this in, then,' the Doctor muttered. She rose.
'I'm sure it's good you enjoy your job so, chief torturer,' she
said. 'However, I think you've killed this one.'</p>

<p>'You're the doctor, you heal him!' Nolieti said, stepping back
towards her, brandishing the orange-red poker. I do not think he
intended to threaten the Doctor, but I saw her right hand begin to
drop towards the boot where her old dagger was sheathed.</p>

<p>She looked up at the torturer, past the glowing metal rod. 'I'll
give him something that might revive him, but he may well have
given you all he ever will. Don't blame me if he dies.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but I will,' Nolieti said quietly, thrusting the poker back
into the brazier. Cinders splashed to the flag stones. 'You make
sure he lives, woman. You make sure he's fit to talk or the King'll
hear you couldn't do your job.'</p>

<p>'The King will hear anyway, no doubt,' the Doctor said, smiling
at me. I smiled nervously back. 'And guard commander Adlain, too,'
she added, 'perhaps from me.' She swung the man in the cage-chair
back upright and opened a vial in her bag, wiped a wooden spatula
round the inside of the vial and then, opening the bloody mess that
was the man's mouth, applied some of the ointment to his gums. He
moaned again.</p>

<p>The Doctor stood watching him for a moment, then stepped to the
brazier and put the spatula into it. The wood flamed and
spluttered. She looked at her hands, then at Nolieti. 'Do you have
any water down here? I mean clean water.'</p>

<p>The chief torturer nodded at Unoure, who disappeared into the
shadows for a while before bringing a bowl which the Doctor washed
her hands in. She was wiping them clean on the kerchief which had
been her blindfold when the man in the chair cage gave a terrible
screech of agony, shook violently for a few moments, then stiffened
suddenly and finally went limp. The Doctor stepped towards him and
went to put her hand to his neck but she was knocked aside by
Nolieti, who gave an angry, anguished shout of his own and reached
through the iron hoops to place his finger on the pulse-point on
the neck which the Doctor has taught me is the best place to test
the beat of a man's vitality.</p>

<p>The chief torturer stood there, quivering, while his assistant
gazed on with an expression of apprehension and terror. The
Doctor's look was one of grimly contemptuous amusement. Then
Nolieti spun round and stabbed a finger at her. 'You!' he hissed at
her. 'You killed him. You didn't want him to live!'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked unconcerned, and continued drying her hands
(though it seemed to me that they were both already dry, and
shaking). 'I am sworn to save life, chief torturer, not to take
it,' she said reasonably. 'I leave that to others.'</p>

<p>'What was in that stuff?' the chief torturer said, quickly
squatting to wrench open the Doctor's bag. He pulled out the open
vial she had taken the ointment from and brandished it in her face.
'This. What is it?'</p>

<p>'A stimulant,' she said, and dipped a finger into the vial,
displaying a small fold of the soft brown gel on her finger tip so
that it glinted in the light of the brazier. 'Would you like to try
it?' She moved the finger towards Nolieti's mouth.</p>

<p>The chief torturer grabbed her hand in one of his and forced the
finger back, towards her own lips. 'No. You do it. Do what you did
to him.'</p>

<p>The Doctor shook her hand free of Nolieti's and calmly put her
finger to her mouth, spreading the brown paste along her top gum.
'The taste is bitter-sweet,' she said in the same tone she uses
when she is teaching me. 'The effects last between two and three
bells and usually have no side effects, though in a body seriously
weakened and in shock, fits are likely and death is a remote
possibility.' She licked her finger. 'Children in particular suffer
severe side effects with almost no restorative function and it is
never recommended for them. The gel is made from the berries of a
biennial plant which grows on isolated peninsulae on islands in the
very north of Drezen. It is quite precious, and more usually
applied in a solution, in which form, too, it is most stable and
long-lasting. I have used it to treat the King on occasion and he
regards it as one of my more efficacious prescriptions. There is
not much left now and I would have preferred not to waste it on
either those who are going to die anyway, or on myself, but you did
insist. I am sure the King will not mind.' (I have to report,
Master, that as far as I am aware, the Doctor has never used this
particular gel &mdash; of which she has several jars &mdash; on the King, and I
am not sure she had ever used it to treat any patient.) The Doctor
closed her mouth and I could see her wipe her tongue round her top
gum. Then she smiled. 'Are you sure you won't try some?'</p>

<p>Nolieti said nothing for a moment, his broad, dark face moving
as though he was chewing on his tongue.</p>

<p>'Get this Drezen witch out of here,' he said eventually to
Unoure, and then turned away to stamp on the brazier's
foot-bellows. The brazier hissed and glowed yellow, showering
sparks up into its sooty chimney. Nolieti glanced at the dead man
in the cage-chair. 'Then take this bastard to the acid bath,' he
barked.</p>

<p>We were at the door when the chief torturer, still working the
foot-bellows with a regular, thrusting stroke, called out,
'Doctor?'</p>

<p>She turned to look at hire as Unoure opened the door and fished
the black blindfold from his apron. 'Yes, chief torturer?' she
said.</p>

<p>He looked round at us, smiling as he continued to fire the
brazier. 'You'll be here again, Drezen woman,' he said softly to
her. His eyes glittered in the yellow brazier light. 'And next time
you won't be able to walk out.'</p>

<p>The Doctor held his gaze for a good while, until she looked down
and shrugged. 'Or you will appear in my surgery,' she told him,
looking up. 'And may be assured of my best attention.'</p>

<p>The chief torturer turned away and spat into the brazier, his
foot stamping on the bellows and breathing life into that
instrument of death as we were ushered out of the low door by the
assistant Unoure.</p>

<p>Two hundred heartbeats later we were met at the tall iron doors
which led into the rest of the palace by a footman of the royal
chamber.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'It's my back again, Vosill,' the King said, turning on to his
front on the wide, canopied bed while the Doctor rolled up first
her own sleeves and then the King's tunic top and shift. And we
were in the principal bed-chamber of King Quience's private
apartments, deep within the innermost quadrangle of Efernze, the
winter palace of Haspide, capital of Haspidus!</p>

<p>This has become such a regular haunt of mine, indeed such a
regular place of work, that I confess I am inclined to forget that
I am honoured indeed to be present. When I stop to consider the
matter though, I think, Great Gods, I &mdash; an orphan of a disgraced
family &mdash; am in the presence of our beloved King! And regularly, and
intimately!</p>

<p>At such moments, Master, I thank you in my soul with all the
vigour that is mine to command, for I know that it was only your
kindness, wisdom and compassion that put me in such an exalted
position and entrusted me with such an important mission. Be
assured that I shall continue to try with all my might to be worthy
of that trust, and fulfil that task.</p>

<p>Wiester, the King's chamberlain, had let us into the apartments.
'Will that be all, sir?' he asked, bending and hunching over as
well as his ample frame would allow.</p>

<p>'Yes. That's all for now. Go.'</p>

<p>The Doctor sat on the side of the King's bed and kneaded his
shoulders and back with her strong, capable fingers. She had me
hold a small jar of rich-smelling unguent which she dipped her
fingers into every now and again, spreading the ointment across the
King's broad, hairy back and working it into his pale gold skin
with her fingers and palms.</p>

<p>As I sat there, with the Doctor's medicine bag open at my side,
I noticed that the jar of brown gel which she had used to treat the
wretch in the hidden chamber was still lying opened on one of the
bag's ingeniously fashioned internal shelves. I went to stick my
own finger into the jar. The Doctor saw what I was doing and
quickly took hold of my hand and pulled it away from the jar and
said quietly, 'I wouldn't, Oelph, if I were you. Just put the top
back on carefully.'</p>

<p>'What's that, Vosill?' the King asked.</p>

<p>'Nothing, sir,' the Doctor said, replacing her hands on the
King's back and leaning forward on to him.</p>

<p>'Ouch,' the King said.</p>

<p>'Mostly muscular tension,' the Doctor said softly, flicking her
head so that her hair, which had partly fallen across her face, was
sent spilling back over her shoulder.</p>

<p>'My father never had to suffer so,' the King said morosely into
his gold-threaded pillow, his voice made deeper by the thickness
and weight of fabric and feathers.</p>

<p>The Doctor smiled quickly at me. 'What, sir,' she said. 'You
mean he never had to suffer my clumsy ministrations?'</p>

<p>'No,' the King said, groaning. 'You know what I mean, Vosill.
This back. He never had to suffer this back. Or my leg cramps, or
my headaches, or my constipation, or any of these aches and pains.'
He was silent a moment as the Doctor pushed and pressed at his
skin. 'Father never had to suffer anything. He never&mdash;'</p>

<p>'&mdash;had a day's illness in his life,' the Doctor said, in chorus
with the King.</p>

<p>The King laughed. The Doctor smiled at me again. I held the jar
of ointment, inexpressibly happy for just that moment, until the
King sighed and said, 'Ah, such sweet torture, Vosill.'</p>

<p>Whereupon the Doctor paused in her rocking, kneading motion, and
a look of bitterness, even contempt, passed briefly over her
face.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="chapter">2. THE BODYGUARD</h3>

<p>This is the story of the man known as DeWar, who was principal
bodyguard to General UrLeyn, Prime Protector of the Tassasen
Protectorate, for the years 1218 to 1221, Imperial. Most of my tale
takes place in the palace of Vorifyr, in Crough, the ancient
capital city of Tassasen, during that fateful year of 1221.</p>

<p>I have chosen to tell the story after the fashion of the Jeritic
fabulists, that is in the form of a Closed Chronicle, in which &mdash; if
one is inclined to believe such information of consequence &mdash; one
has to guess the identity of the person telling the tale. My
motive in doing so is to present the reader with a chance to choose
whether to believe or disbelieve what I have to say about the
events of that time &mdash; the broad facts of which are of course well
known, even notorious, throughout the civilised world purely on the
evidence of whether the story 'rings true' for them or not, and
without the prejudice which might result from knowing the identity
of the narrator closing the mind of the reader to the truth I wish
to present.</p>

<p>And it is time the truth was finally told. I have read, I think,
all the various accounts of what happened in Tassasen during that
momentous time, and the most significant difference between those
reports seems to be the degree to which they depart most
outrageously from what actually happened. There was one travesty of
a version in particular which determined me to tell the true story
of the time. It took the form of a play and claimed to tell my own
tale, yet its ending could scarcely have been wider of the mark.
The reader need only accept that I am who I am for its
nonsensicality to be obvious.</p>

<p>I say this is DeWar's story, and yet I freely admit that it is
not the whole of his story. It is only part, and arguably only a
small part, measured solely in years. There was a part before, too,
but history allows only the haziest notion of what that earlier
past was like.</p>

<p>So, this is the truth as I experienced it, or as it was told to
me by those I trusted.</p>

<p>Truth, I have learned, differs for everybody. Just as no two
people ever see a rainbow in exactly the same place &mdash; and yet both
most certainly see it, while the person seemingly standing right
underneath it does not see it at all &mdash; so truth is a question of
where one stands, and the direction one is looking in at the
time.</p>

<p>Of course, the reader may choose to differ from me in this
belief, and is welcome to do so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'DeWar? Is that you?' The Prime Protector, First General and
Grand Aedile of the Protectorate of Tassasen, General UrLeyn,
shaded his eyes from the glare of a fan-shaped plaster-and-gem
window above the hall's polished jet floor. It was midday, with
Xamis and Seigen both shining brightly in a clear sky outside.</p>

<p>'Sir,' DeWar said, stepping from the shadows at the edge of the
room, where the maps were kept in a great wooden lattice. He bowed
to the Protector and set a map on the table in front of him. 'I
think this is the map you might need.'</p>

<p>DeWar: a tall, muscular man in early middle-age, dark-haired,
dark-skinned and dark-browed, with deep, hooded eyes and a
watchful, brooding look about him that quite suited his profession,
which he once described as assassinating assassins. He seemed both
relaxed and yet tensed, like an animal perpetually hunkered back
ready to pounce, yet perfectly capable of remaining in that coiled
position for as long as it might take for its prey to come into
range and let drop its guard.</p>

<p>He was dressed, as ever, in black. His boots, hose, tunic and
short jacket were all as dark as an eclipse-night. A narrow,
sheathed sword hung from his right hip, a long dagger from his
left.</p>

<p>'You fetch maps for my generals now, DeWar?' UrLeyn asked,
amused. The General of generals of Tassasen, the commoner who
commanded nobles, was a relatively small man who by dint of the
bustling, busy force of his character made almost everybody feel
that they were no taller than he. His hair was brindled, grey and
thinning but his eyes were bright. People generally called his gaze
'piercing'. He was dressed in the trousers and long jacket he had
made the fashion amongst many of his fellow generals and large
sections of the Tassasem trading classes.</p>

<p>'When my general sends me away from him, sir, yes,' DeWar
replied. 'I try to do whatever I can to help. And such actions help
prevent me dwelling on the risks my lord might be exposing himself
to when he has me leave his side.' DeWar tossed the map on to the
table, where it unrolled.</p>

<p>'The borders . . . Ladenscion,' UrLeyn breathed, patting the
soft surface of the old map, then looking up at DeWar with a
mischievous expression. 'My dear DeWar, the greatest danger I
expose myself to on such occasions is probably a dose of something
unpleasant from some lass newly brought in, or possibly a slap for
suggesting something my more demure concubines find excessively
rude.' The General grinned, hitching up the belt round his modest
pot-belly. 'Or a scratched back or bitten ear, if I'm lucky,
eh?'</p>

<p>'The General puts us younger men to shame in many ways,' DeWar
murmured, smoothing out the parchment map. 'But it is not unknown
for assassins to have less respect for the privacy of a great
leader's harem than, say, his chief bodyguard.'</p>

<p>'An assassin prepared to risk the wrath of .my dear concubines
would almost deserve to succeed,' UrLeyn said, eyes twinkling as he
pulled at his short grey moustache. 'Providence knows their
affection is rough enough at times.' He reached out and tapped the
younger man's elbow with one bunched fist. 'Eh?'</p>

<p>'Indeed, sir. Still, I think the General could &mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah! The rest of the gang,' UrLeyn said, clapping his hands as
the double doors at the far end of the hall opened to admit a
number of men &mdash; all clad similarly to the General &mdash; and a
surrounding flock of aides in military uniforms, frock-coated
clerks and assorted other helpers. 'YetAmidous!' the Protector
cried, walking quickly forward to greet the big, rough-faced man
leading the group, shaking his hand and clapping his back. He
greeted all of the other noble generals by name, then caught sight
of his brother. 'RuLeuin! Back from the Thrown Isles! Is all well?'
He wrapped his arms round the taller, thicker-set man, who smiled
slowly as he nodded and said, 'Yes, sir.' Then the Protector saw
his son and bent down to lift him into his arms. 'And Lattens! My
favourite boy! You finished your studies!'</p>

<p>'Yes, Father!' the boy said. He was dressed like a little
soldier, and flourished a wooden sword.</p>

<p>'Good! You can come and help us decide what to do about our
rebellious barons in the marches!'</p>

<p>'Just for a while, brother,' RuLeuin said. 'This is a treat. His
tutor needs him back on the bell.'</p>

<p>'Ample time for Lattens to make all the difference to our
plans,' UrLeyn said, sitting the child on the map table.</p>

<p>Clerks and scribes scuttled over to the great wooden map lattice
on one wall, fighting to be first. 'Never mind!' the General called
after them. 'Here's the map!' he shouted, as his brother and fellow
generals clustered round the great table. 'Somebody already...'
the General began, looking round the table for DeWar, then shaking
his head and returning his attention to the map.</p>

<p>Behind him, hidden from the Protector by the taller men gathered
about him but never more than a sword length away, his chief
bodyguard stood, arms casually crossed, hands resting on the
pommels of his most obvious weapons, unnoticed and almost unseen,
gaze sweeping the surrounding crowd.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Once there was a great Emperor who was much feared throughout
what was then all the known world, save for the outer wastelands
which nobody with any sense bothered about and where only savages
lived. The Emperor had no equals and no rivals. His own realm
covered the better part of the world and all the kings of all the
rest of the world bowed down before him and offered him generous
tribute. His power was absolute and he had come to fear nothing
except death, which comes eventually for all men, even
Emperors.</p>

<p>'He determined to try and cheat death too &mdash; by building a
monumental palace so great, so magnificent, so spell-bindingly
sumptuous that Death itself &mdash; which was believed to come for those
of royal birth in the shape of a great fiery bird visible only to
the dying &mdash; would be tempted to stay in the great monument and
dwell there and not return to the depths of the sky with the
Emperor clutched in its talons of flame.</p>

<p>'Accordingly the Emperor caused a great monumental palace to be
built on an island in the centre of a great circular lake on the
edge of the plains and the ocean, some way from his capital city.
The palace was fashioned in the shape of a mighty conical tower
half a hundred storeys tall. It was filled with every imaginable
luxury and treasure the empire and kingdoms could provide, all
secured deep within the furthest reaches of the monument, where
they would be hidden from the common thief yet visible to the fiery
bird when it came for the Emperor.</p>

<p>'There too were placed magical statues of all the Emperor's
favourites, wives and concubines, all guaranteed by his holiest
holy men to come alive when the Emperor died and the great bird of
fire came to take him.</p>

<p>'The chief architect of the palace was a man called Munnosh who
was renowned throughout the world as the greatest builder there had
ever been, and it was his skill and cunning that made the whole
great project possible. For this reason the Emperor showered
Munnosh with riches, favours and concubines. But Munnosh was ten
years younger than the Emperor, and as the Emperor grew old and the
great monument neared completion, he knew that Munnosh would
outlive him, and might speak, or be made to speak of how and where
the great cache of riches had been placed within the palace, once
the Emperor had died and was living there with the great bird of
fire and the magically alive statues. Munnosh might even have time
to complete a still greater monument for the next King who ascended
to the Imperial throne and became Emperor.</p>

<p>'With this in mind, the Emperor waited until the great mausoleum
was all but finished and then had Munnosh lured to the very deepest
level of the vast edifice, and while the architect waited in a
small chamber deep underground for what he had been promised would
be a great surprise, he was walled in by the Imperial guards, who
closed off all that part of the lowest level.</p>

<p>'The Emperor had his courtiers tell Munnosh's family that the
architect had been killed when a great block of stone fell on him
while he was inspecting the building, and they grieved loudly and
terribly.</p>

<p>'But the Emperor had misjudged the cunning and wariness of the
architect, who had long suspected something just like this might
happen. Accordingly, he had had constructed a hidden passage from
the lowest cellars of the great monumental palace to the outside.
When Munnosh realised he had been immured, he uncovered the hidden
passage and made his way to the ground above, where he waited until
the night and then stole away on one of the workers' boats, gliding
across the circular lake.</p>

<p>'When he returned to his home his wife, who thought she was a
widow, and his children, who thought they were without a father, at
first thought he was a ghost, and shrank from him in fear.
Eventually he persuaded them that he was alive, and that they
should accompany him into exile, away from the Empire. The whole
family made their escape to a distant Kingdom where the King had
need of a great builder to oversee the construction of
fortifications to keep out the savages of the wastelands, and where
everybody either did not know who this great architect was, or
pretended not to for the sake of the fortifications and the safety
of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>'However, the Emperor heard that a great architect was at work
in this distant Kingdom, and, through various rumours and reports,
came to suspect that this master builder was indeed Munnosh. The
Emperor, who was by now very frail and elderly and near death,
ordered the secret opening-up of the great mausoleum's lower
levels. This was done, and of course Munnosh was not there, and the
secret passage-way was discovered.</p>

<p>'The Emperor ordered the King to send his master builder to the
Imperial capital. The King at first refused, asking for more time
because the fortifications were not ready yet and the savages of
the wasteland were proving more tenacious and better organised than
had been anticipated, but the Emperor, still nearer to death now,
insisted, and eventually the King gave in and with great reluctance
sent the architect Munnosh to the capital. The architect's family
treated his departure as they had the false news that he had been
killed, those many years ago.</p>

<p>'The Emperor at this time was so close to dying that he spent
almost all his time in the great death-defying palace Munnosh had
constructed for him, and it was there that Munnosh was taken.</p>

<p>'When the Emperor saw Munnosh, and knew that it was his old
chief architect, he cried out, "Munnosh, treacherous Munnosh! Why
did you desert me and your greatest creation?"</p>

<p>'"Because you had me walled up within it and left to die, my
Emperor," Munnosh replied.</p>

<p>'"It was done only to assure the safety of your Emperor and to
preserve your own good name," the old tyrant told Munnosh. "You
ought to have accepted what was done and let your family mourn you
decently and in peace. Instead you led them into benighted exile
and only ensured that now they will have to mourn you a second
time."</p>

<p>'When the Emperor said this, Munnosh fell to his knees and began
to weep and to plead for forgiveness from the Emperor. The Emperor
held out one thin, shaking hand and smiled and said, "But that need
not concern you, because I have sent my finest assassins to seek
out your wife and your children and your grandchildren, to kill
them all before they can learn of your disgrace and death."</p>

<p>'At this Munnosh, who had concealed a mason's store chisel
beneath his robes, leapt forward and tried to strike the Emperor
down, aiming the chisel straight at the old man's throat.</p>

<p>'Instead Munnosh was struck down, before his blow could fall, by
the Emperor's chief bodyguard, who never left his master's
side. The man who had once been Imperial chief architect landed
dead at his Emperor's feet, head severed by a single terrible blow
from the bodyguard's sword.</p>

<p>'But the chief bodyguard was so full of shame that Munnosh had
come so close to the Emperor with a weapon, and also so appalled at
the cruelty which the Emperor intended to visit on the innocent
family of the architect &mdash; which was but the grain that breaks the
bridge, for he had witnessed a lifetime's cruelty from the old
tyrant &mdash; that he killed the Emperor and then himself, with another
two swinging blows from his mighty sword, before anybody else could
move to stop him.</p>

<p>'The Emperor got his wish then, dying within the great palatial
mausoleum he had built. Whether he succeeded in cheating death or
not we cannot know, but it is unlikely, as the Empire fell apart
very soon after his death and the vast monument he caused to be
constructed at such crippling expense to his empire was looted
utterly within the year and fell quickly into disrepair, so that
now it is used only as a ready source of dressed stone for the city
of Haspide, which was founded a few centuries later on the same
island, in what is now called Crater Lake, in the Kingdom of
Haspidus.'</p>

<p>'What a sad tale! But what happened to the family of Munnosh?'
asked the lady Perrund. The lady Perrund had once been the first
concubine of the Protector. She remained a prized partner of the
General's household and one
whom he was still known to visit on occasion.</p>

<p>The bodyguard DeWar shrugged. 'We don't know,' he told her. 'The
Empire fell, the Kings fought amongst themselves, the barbarians
invaded from all sides, fire fell from the sky and a dark age
resulted that lasted many hundreds of years. Little historical
detail survived the fall of the lesser kingdoms.'</p>

<p>'But we may hope that the assassins heard their Emperor was dead
and so did not carry out their mission, may we not? Or that they
were caught up in the chaos of the Empire's collapse and had to
look to their own safety. Would that not be likely?'</p>

<p>DeWar looked into the eyes of the lady Perrund and smiled.
'Perfectly possible, my lady.'</p>

<p>'Good,' she said, crossing one arm across the other and settling
back to lean over the game board again. 'That is what I shall
choose to believe, then. Now we can restart our game. It was my
move, I believe.'</p>

<p>DeWar smiled as he watched Perrund put one clenched fist to her
mouth. Her gaze, beneath long fair lashes, flicked this way and
that across the game board, coming to rest on pieces for a few
moments, then sweeping away again.</p>

<p>She wore the long, plain red day-gown of the senior ladies of
the court, one of the few fashions the Protectorate had inherited
from the earlier Kingdom, which the Protector and his fellow
generals had overthrown in the war of succession. It was a given
within the court that Perrund's seniority was founded more upon the
intensity of her earlier service to the Protector UrLeyn than on
her physical age, a reputation &mdash; that of most favoured concubine to
a man who had not yet chosen a wife &mdash; she was still fiercely proud
of.</p>

<p>There .was another reason for her promotion to such seniority,
and the mark of that was the second badge she wore, the sling &mdash;
also red &mdash; that supported her withered left arm.</p>

<p>Perrund, anybody in the court would tell you, had given more of
herself in the service of her beloved General than any other of his
women, sacrificing the use of a limb to protect him from an
assassin's blade and indeed very nearly losing her life altogether,
for the same cut that had severed muscles and tendons and broken
bone had opened an artery as well, and she had come close to
bleeding to death even as UrLeyn had been hurried away from the
melee by his guards and the assassin had been overpowered and
disarmed.</p>

<p>The withered arm was her only blemish, even if it was a terrible
one. Otherwise she was as tall and fair as any fairy-tale princess,
and the younger women of the harem, who saw her naked in the baths,
inspected her golden-brown skin in vain for the more obvious signs
of encroaching age. Her face was broad &mdash; too broad, she thought,
and so framed it carefully in her long blonde hair to make it look
slimmer when she did not wear a head-dress, and chose head-dresses
which performed the same function when she was to be seen in
public. Her nose was slim and her mouth at first plain until she
smiled, which she often did.</p>

<p>Her pupils were gold flecked with blue and her eyes were large
and open and somehow innocent. They could quickly look hurt at
insults and when she was told tales of cruelty and pain, but such
expressions were like summer storms &mdash; over quickly and immediately
replaced by a prevailing, temperate brightness. She seemed to take
an almost childish delight in life in general which was never far
from being embodied in the sparkle of those eyes, and people who
thought they knew about such things said they believed she was the
only person in the court whose force of gaze could match that of
the Protector himself.</p>

<p>'There,' she said composedly, moving a piece across the board
into DeWar's territory and then sitting back. Her good hand
massaged the withered one, which lay in the red sling, motionless
and unresponding. DeWar thought it looked like the hand of a sickly
child, it was so pale and thin and the skin so nearly translucent.
He knew that she still experienced pain from the disabled limb,
three years after the initial injury, and that she did not always
realise when her good hand stroked and kneaded the sick one, as it
did now. He saw this without looking at it, his gaze held by hers
as she leaned further back into the couch's cushions, which were as
plump, red and numerous as berries on a winter bush.</p>

<p>They sat in the visiting chamber of the outer harem, where on
special occasions close relatives of the concubines were sometimes
allowed to visit them. DeWar, once again waiting on UrLeyn while
the General spent a while with the harem's most recent young
recruits, had for some time been granted the singular dispensation
of being allowed to enter the visiting chamber whenever the
Protector was in the harem. This meant that DeWar was a little
closer to UrLeyn than the General would ideally have preferred his
chief bodyguard to be during such interludes, and much further away
than DeWar felt comfortable with.</p>

<p>DeWar knew the sort of jokes that circulated the Court about
him. It was said that his dream was to be so close to his master at
all times that he could wipe the General's backside in the toilet
and his prick in the harem-alcove. Another was that he secretly
desired to be a woman, so that when the General wanted sex he need
look no further than his faithful bodyguard, and no other bodily
contact need be risked.</p>

<p>Whether Stike, the harem's chief eunuch, had heard that
particular rumour was moot. Certainly he watched the bodyguard with
what appeared to be great and professional suspicion. The chief
eunuch sat massively in his pulpit at one end of the long chamber,
which was lit from above by three porcelain light-domes. The
chamber's walls were entirely covered with thickly pendulous
swathes of ornately woven brocade, while further loops and bowls of
fabric hung suspended from the roof spaces between the domes,
ruffling in the breeze from the ceiling louvres. The chief eunuch
Stike was dressed in great folds of white and his vast waist was
girdled with the gold and silver key-chains of his office. He
occasionally spared a glance for the few other veiled girls who had
chosen the visiting chamber for their giggled conversations and
petulant games of card and board, but he concentrated on the only
man in the room and his game with the damaged concubine
Perrund.</p>

<p>DeWar studied the board. 'Ah-ha,' he said. His Emperor piece was
threatened, or certainly would be in another move or two. Perrund
gave a dainty snort, and DeWar looked up to see his opponent's good
hand held up flat against her mouth, painted finger-nails golden
against her lips and an expression of innocence in her wide
eyes.</p>

<p>'What?' she asked.</p>

<p>'You know what,' he said, smiling. 'You're after my
Emperor.'</p>

<p>'DeWar,' she said, tutting. 'You mean I'm after your
Protector.'</p>

<p>'Hmm,' he said, putting his elbows on his knees and his chin on
his bunched fists. Officially the Emperor was called the Protector
piece now, after the dissolution of the old Empire and fall of the
last King of Tassasen. New sets of the game of 'Monarch's Dispute'
sold in Tassasen these days came in boxes which, to those who could
read, proclaimed the game they contained to be 'Leader's Dispute',
and held revised pieces: a Protector instead of an Emperor,
Generals in place of Kings, Colonels instead of Dukes, and Captains
where before there had been Barons. Many people, either fearful of
the new regime or simply wishing to show their allegiance to it,
had thrown out their old sets of the game along with their
portraits of the King. It seemed that only in the Palace of Vorifyr
itself were people more relaxed.</p>

<p>DeWar lost himself studying the position of the pieces for a few
moments. Then he heard Perrund make another noise, and looked up
again to see her shaking her head at him, eyes glittering.</p>

<p>Now it was his turn to say, 'What?'</p>

<p>'Oh, DeWar,' she said. 'I have heard people in the Court say you
are the most cunning person they know in it, and thank Providence
that you are so devoted to the General, because if you were a man
of independent ambition they would fear you.'</p>

<p>DeWar shrugged. 'Really? I suppose I ought to feel flattered,
but &mdash;'</p>

<p>'And yet you are so easy to play at Dispute,' Perrund said,
laughing.</p>

<p>'Am I?'</p>

<p>'Yes, and for the most obvious reason. You do too much to
protect your Protector piece. You sacrifice everything to keep it
free from threat.' She nodded at the board. 'Look. You are thinking
about blocking my Mounted piece with your eastern General, leaving
it open to my Tower after we've exchanged Caravels on the left
flank. Well, aren't you?'</p>

<p>DeWar frowned deeply, staring at the board. He felt his face
flush. He looked up again at those golden, mocking eyes. 'Yes. So I
am transparent, is that it?'</p>

<p>'You are predictable,' Perrund told him softly. 'Your obsession
with the Emperor &mdash; with the Protector &mdash; is a weakness. Lose the
Protector and one of the Generals takes its place. You treat it as
though its loss would be the end of the game. I was wondering . . .
Did you ever play "A Kingdom Unjustly Divided" before you learned
"Monarch's Dispute"?' she asked. 'Do you know of it?' she added,
surprised, when he looked blank. 'In that game the loss of either
King does indeed signify the end of the game.'</p>

<p>'I've heard of it,' DeWar said defensively, picking up his
Protector piece and turning it over in his hands. 'I confess I
haven't played it properly, but &mdash;'</p>

<p>Perrund clapped her good hand on her thigh, attracting the
frowning stare of the watchful eunuch. 'I knew it!' she said,
laughing and rocking forward on the couch. 'You protect the
Protector because you can't help it. You know it's not really the
game but it would hurt you to do otherwise because you are so much
the bodyguard!'</p>

<p>DeWar put the Protector piece back down on the board and drew
himself up on the small stool he sat upon, uncrossing his legs and
adjusting the positions of his sword and his dagger. 'It's not
that,' he said, pausing to study the board again briefly. 'It's not
that. It's just . . . my style. The way I choose to play the
game.'</p>

<p>'Oh, DeWar," Perrund said with an unladylike snort. 'What
nonsense! That is not style, it's fault! If you play like that it's
like fighting with one hand tied behind your back . . .' She looked
down ruefully at the arm in the red sling. 'Or one hand wasted,'
she added, then held up her good hand to him as he went to protest.
'Now just you never mind that. Attend to my point. You cannot stop
being a bodyguard even when playing a silly game to pass the time
with an old concubine while your master dallies with a younger one.
You must admit it and be proud &mdash; secretly or not, it's equal to me &mdash;
or I shall be quite thoroughly upset. Now, speak and tell me I'm
right.'</p>

<p>DeWar sat back, holding both hands out wide in a gesture of
defeat. 'My lady,' he said, 'it is just as you say.'</p>

<p>Perrund laughed. 'Don't give in so easily. Argue.'</p>

<p>'I can't. You're right. I am only glad that you think my
obsession might be commendable. But it is just as you say. My job
is my life, and I am never off-duty. And I never will be until I am
dismissed, I fail in my job, or &mdash; Providence consign such an
eventuality to the distant future &mdash; the Protector dies a natural
death.'</p>

<p>Perrund looked down at the board. 'In a ripe old age,
as you say,' she agreed before looking up at him again. 'And do
you still feel you're missing something which might prevent such a
natural end?'</p>

<p>DeWar looked awkward. He picked up the Protector piece again
and, as though addressing it, in a low voice said, 'His life is in
more danger than anybody here seems to think. Certainly it is in
more danger than he appears to believe.' He looked up at the lady
Perrund, a small, hesitant smile on his face. 'Or am I being too
obsessive again?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' Perrund said, sitting closer and dropping her
voice too, 'why you seem so sure that people want him dead.'</p>

<p>'Of course people want him dead,' DeWar said. 'He had the
courage to commit regicide, the temerity to create a new way of
governing. The Kings and Dukes who opposed the Protector from the
start found him a more skilled politician and far better field
commander than they'd expected. With great skill and a little luck
he prevailed, and the acclamation of the newly enfranchised in
Tassasen has made it difficult for anybody else in the old Kingdom
or indeed anywhere in the old Empire to oppose him directly.'</p>

<p>'There must be a "but" or a "however" about to make its
appearance here,' Perrund said. 'I can tell it.'</p>

<p>'Indeed. <em>But</em> there are those who have greeted UrLeyn's coming to
power with every possible expression of enthusiasm and who have
gone out of their way to support him in most public ways, yet who
secretly know that their own existence &mdash; or at the very least their
own supremacy &mdash; is threatened by his continued rule. They are the
ones I'm worried about, and they must have made their plans for our
Protector. The first few attempts at assassination failed, but not
by much. And only your bravery stopped the most determined of
them, lady,' DeWar said.</p>

<p>Perrund looked away, and her good hand went to touch the
withered one. 'Yes,' she said. 'I did tell your predecessor that as
I had stepped in to perform his job he ought to do the decent thing
and attempt to fulfil mine one day, but he just laughed.'</p>

<p>DeWar smiled. 'Commander ZeSpiole tells that story himself,
still.'</p>

<p>'Hmm. Well, perhaps as Commander of the Palace Guard, ZeSpiole
does such a good job keeping would-be assassins away from the
palace that none ever achieve the sort of proximity that might call
for your services.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps, but either way they will be back,' DeWar said quietly.
'I almost wish they had been back by now. The absence of
conventional assassins makes me all the more convinced there is
some very special assassin here, just waiting for the right time to
strike.'</p>

<p>Perrund looked troubled, even sad, the man thought. 'But come,
DeWar,' she said, 'is this not too gloomily contrary? Perhaps there
are no attempts on the Protector's life because no one of moment
any longer wishes him dead. Why assume the most depressing
explanation? Can you never be, if not relaxed, then content?'</p>

<p>DeWar took a deep breath and then released it. He replaced the
Protector piece. 'These are not times when people in my profession
can relax.'</p>

<p>'They say the old days were always better. Do you think so,
DeWar?'</p>

<p>'No, lady, I do not.' He gazed into her eyes. 'I think a lot of
nonsense is talked about the old days.'</p>

<p>'But, DeWar, they were days of legends, days of heroes!' Perrund
said, her expression indicating she was not being entirely serious.
'Everything was better, everybody says so!'</p>

<p>'Some of us prefer history to legends, lady,' DeWar said
heavily, 'and sometimes everybody can be wrong.'</p>

<p>'Can they?'</p>

<p>'Indeed. Once everybody thought the world was flat.'</p>

<p>'Many still do,' Perrund said, raising one brow. 'Few peasants
want to think they might fall out of their fields, and a lot of us
who know the truth find it hard to accept.'</p>

<p>'Nevertheless, it is the case.' DeWar smiled. 'It can be
proved.'</p>

<p>Perrund smiled too. 'With sticks in the ground?'</p>

<p>'And shadows, and mathematics.'</p>

<p>Perrund gave a quick, sideways nod. It was a mannerism that
seemed to acknowledge and dismiss at the same time. 'What a very
certain, if rather dismal world you seem to live in, DeWar.'</p>

<p>'It is the same world that everyone inhabits, if they but knew,
my lady. It's just that only some of us have our eyes open.'</p>

<p>Perrund drew in a breath. 'Oh! Well, those of us still stumbling
around with our eyes tightly shut had best be grateful to people
like you then, I should think.'</p>

<p>'I'd have thought that you at least, my lady, would have no need
of a sighted guide.'</p>

<p>'I am just a crippled, ill-educated concubine, DeWar. A poor
orphan who might have met a terrible fate if I had not caught the
eye of the Protector.' She made her withered arm move by flexing
her left shoulder towards him. 'Sadly I later caught a blow as well
as a glance, but I am as glad of one as the other.' She paused and
DeWar drew a breath to speak, but then she nodded down at the board
and said, 'Are you going to move, or not?'</p>

<p>DeWar sighed and gestured at the board. 'Is there any point, if
I am so deficient an adversary?'</p>

<p>'You must play, and play to win even if you know you will
probably lose,' Perrund told him. 'Otherwise you should not have
agreed to begin the game in the first place.'</p>

<p>'You changed the nature of the game when you informed me of my
weakness.'</p>

<p>'Ah no, the game was always the same, DeWar,' Perrund said,
sitting suddenly forward, her eyes seeming to flash as she added
with a degree of relish, 'I merely opened your eyes to it.'</p>

<p>DeWar laughed. 'Indeed you did, my lady.' He sat forward and
went to move his Protector piece, then sat back again and with a
despairing gesture said, 'No. I concede, my lady. You have
won.'</p>

<p>There was some commotion amongst the group of concubines nearest
to the doors which led into the rest of the harem. In his high
pulpit, the chief eunuch Stike wobbled to his feet and bowed to the
small figure bustling into the long chamber.</p>

<p>'DeWar!' the Protector UrLeyn called, hauling his jacket on over
his shoulders as he strode towards them. 'And Perrund! My dear! My
darling!'</p>

<p>Perrund stood suddenly, and DeWar watched her face come alive
again, the eyes widening, her expression softening and her face
blossoming into the most dazzling smile as UrLeyn approached. DeWar
stood too, the faintest of hurt expressions vanishing from his
face, to be replaced by a relieved smile and a look of professional
seriousness.</p>

<h3 class="chapter">3. THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p>Master, you asked to know most particularly of any sorties which
the Doctor made outside the Palace of Efernze. What I am about to
relate took place the afternoon following our summons to the hidden
chamber and our encounter with the chief torturer Nolieti.</p>

<p>A storm raged above the city, making of the sky a darkly boiling
mass. Fissures of lightning split that gloom with an eye-blinding brightness,
as though they were the
concentrated blues of the everyday sky fighting to prise the
blackness of the clouds apart and shine upon the ground again,
however briefly. The westerly waters of Crater Lake leapt against
the city's ancient harbour walls and surged amongst the deserted
outer docks. It made even the ships within the sheltered inner
quays roll and shift uneasily, their hulls compressing the cane
fenders to make them creak and crack in protest, while their tall
masts swung across the black sky like a forest of disputing
metronomes.</p>

<p>The wind whistled through the streets of the city as we made our
way out of the Blister Gate and headed across Market Square towards
the Warren. An empty stall had been blown over in the square and
its sack roof flapped and tore in the gusts, clapping against the
cobblestones like a trapped wrestler slapping the ground as he begs
for mercy.</p>

<p>The rain came in blustery torrents, stinging and cold. The
Doctor handed me her heavy medicine bag as she wrapped and buttoned
her cloak more tightly about her. I still believe that this &mdash; along
with her jacket and coat &mdash; should be purple, as she is a physician.
However, when she had first arrived two years earlier the doctors
of the city had let it be known that they would take a dim view of
her pretending to this badge of their rank, and the Doctor herself
had seemed indifferent in the matter, and so as a rule she wore
mostly dark and black clothes (though sometimes, in a certain
light, in some of the garments she paid to have made by one of the
court tailors, I thought one could just catch a hint of purple in
the weave).</p>

<p>The wretch who had brought us out into this awfulness limped on
ahead, glancing back at us every now and again as if to make sure
we were still there. How I wished we were not. If ever there was a
day for curling up by a roaring fire with a cup of mulled wine and
a Heroic Romance, this was it. Come to that, a hard bench, a tepid
cup of leaf and one of the Doctor's recommended medical texts would
have seemed like bliss to me, compared to this.</p>

<p>'Filthy weather, eh, Oelph?'</p>

<p>'Yes, mistress.'</p>

<p>They do say the weather has been much more violent since the
fall of the Empire, which is either Providence punishing those who
helped overthrow it, or an Imperial ghost exacting revenge froze
beyond the grave.</p>

<p>The cur who had lured us into this absurd mission was a
hobble-legged child from the Barrows. The palace guards hadn't even
let her into the outer bastion. It had been sheer bad luck that
some fool of a servant, bringing the guards a note of instruction,
had overheard the brat's preposterous pleadings and taken sympathy
on her, coming to find the Doctor in her workshop &mdash; mortar and
pestling her pungently arcane ingredients with my help &mdash; and report
that her services were requested. By some bastard from the slums! I
could not believe it when she agreed. Couldn't she hear the storm
groaning round the lanterns in the roof above? Hadn't she noticed
I'd had to light all our lamps in the room? Was she deaf to the
gurgle of drain water in the walls?</p>

<p>We were on our way to see some destitute breed who were
distantly related to the servants of the Mifelis, the chiefs of the
trader clan the Doctor had worked for when she had first come to
Haspide. The King's personal physician was about to pay a call in a
storm, not on anyone noble, likely to be ennobled or indeed even
respectable, but on a family of slack-witted all-runt
ne'er-do-wells, a tribe of contagiously flea'd happen-ills so
fundamentally useless they were not even servants but merely the
hangers-on of servants, itinerant leeches on the body of the city
and the land.</p>

<p>Coinless and hopeless, to be short about it, and even the Doctor
might have had the sense to refuse but for the fact that she had,
bizarrely, heard of this sickly urchin. 'She has a voice from
another world,' she'd told me as she'd swirled on her cloak, as
though this was all the explanation required.</p>

<p>'Please hurry, mistress!' wailed the whelp who'd come to summon
us. Her accent was thick and her voice made irksome by her
disease-dark snaggle teeth.</p>

<p>'Don't tell the Doctor what to do, you worthless piece of shit!'
I told her, trying to be helpful. The lame brute ducked and hobbled
away in front, across the glistening cobbles of the square.</p>

<p>'Oelph! Kindly keep a civil tongue in your head,' the Doctor
told me, grabbing her medicine bag back from me.</p>

<p>'But mistress!' I protested. At least, though, the Doctor had
waited until our limping guide was out of earshot before chastising
me.</p>

<p>She screwed up her eyes against the lashing rain and raised her
voice above the howl of the wind. 'Do you think we can get a
cab?'</p>

<p>I laughed, then turned the offending noise into a cough. I made
a show of looking around as we approached the lower edge of the
Square, where the lame child had disappeared down a narrow street.
I could just make out a few scavenging people scattered along the
eastern side of the Square, flapping back and forth in their rags
as they collected the half-rotted leaves and rain-sodden husks
which had been blown there from the centre of the Square, where the
vegetable market had been. Not another soul to be seen. Certainly
not a cabbie, rickshaw puller or chair carrier. They had more sense
than to be out in weather like this. 'I think not, mistress,' I
said.</p>

<p>'Oh dear,' the Doctor said, and seemed to hesitate. For one
wonderful moment I thought she might see sense and return us both
back to the warmth and comfort of her apartments, but it was not to
be. 'Oh well,' she said, holding the top of her cloak closed at her
neck, settling her hat more firmly on her gathered-up hair and
putting her head down to hurry onwards. 'Never mind. Come on,
Oelph.'</p>

<p>Cold water was creeping down my neck. 'Coming, mistress.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The day had passed reasonably well until then. The Doctor had
bathed, spent more time writing in her journal, then we had visited
the spice market and nearby bazaars while the storm was still just
a dark brew on the western horizon. She had met with some merchants
and other doctors at the house of a banker to talk about starting a
school for doctors (I was consigned to the kitchen with the
servants and so heard nothing of consequence and little of sense),
then we walked smartly back up to the palace while the sky clouded
over and the first few rain squalls swept in over from the outer
docks. I fondly and quite mistakenly congratulated myself for
escaping back to the comfort and warmth of the palace before the
storm set in.</p>

<p>A note on the door to the Doctor's rooms informed us that the
King desired to see her and so it was off towards his private
apartments as soon as we'd put down our bags full of spices,
berries, roots and earths. A servant intercepted us in the Long
Corridor with news that the King had been wounded in a practice
duel and &mdash; hearts in our mouths &mdash; we made quickly for the game
halls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Sire, a leech! We have the finest! The rare Emperor leech, from
Brotechen!'</p>

<p>'Nonsense! A burn-glass veining is what is required, followed by
an emetic!'</p>


<p>'A simple letting will suffice. Your majesty, if I may&mdash;'</p>


<p>'No! Get away from me, you wittering purple rogues! Away and
become bankers the lot of you &mdash; admit what you really love! Where's
Vosill? Vosill!' the King cried up the broad stairs as he started
up them, left hand clutched round his right upper arm. We were just
starting down.</p>

<p>The King had been injured in a duelling round and it seemed as
if every other doctor of repute in the city must have been in the
duelling chamber that day, for they were clustered round the King
and the two men at his side like purple-coated chasers round a
beast at bay. Their own masters followed at their heels, holding
duelling swords and half-masks, with one large, grey-faced
individual isolated near the rear presumably being the one who'd
cut the King.</p>

<p>Guard Commander Adlain was to one side of the King, Duke Walen
on the other. Adlain, I will record only for posterity, is a man
the nobility and grace of whose features and carriage are matched
only by our good King, though the Guard Commander's appearance is
swarthy where King Quience's is fair &mdash; a faithful, loyal shadow
ever at the side of our splendid ruler. But what monarch could wish
for a more glorious shadow!</p>

<p>Duke Walen is a short, stooped man with leathery skin and small,
deeply recessed eyes which are slightly crossed.</p>

<p>'Sir, are you sure you won't let my physician tend to that
wound?' Walen said in his high, grating voice, while Adlain shooed
away a couple of the harrying doctors. 'Look,' the Duke cried,
'it's dripping! The royal blood! Oh, my word! Physician! Physician!
Really, my lord, this doctor fellow is quite the best. Let me
just&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No!' the King bellowed. 'I want Vosill! Where is she?'</p>

<p>'The lady would appear to have more pressing engagements,'
Adlain said, not unreasonably. 'Lucky it's just a scratch, eh, my
lord?' Then he looked up the steps to see the Doctor and myself
descending. His expression became a smile.</p>

<p>'Vo&mdash;!' the King roared, head down as he bounded up the curve of
steps, briefly leaving both Walen and Adlain behind.</p>

<p>'Here, Sir,' the Doctor said, stepping down to meet him.</p>

<p>'Vosill! Where in the name of all the skies of hell have you
been?'</p>

<p>'I&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Never mind that! Let's to my chambers. You.' (And the King
addressed me!) 'See if you can hold off this pack of bloodsucking
scavengers. Here's my duelling sword.' The King handed me his own
sword! 'You have full permission to use it on anyone who looks
remotely like a physician. Doctor?'</p>

<p>'After you, sir.'</p>

<p>'Yes <em>of</em> <em>course</em> after me, Vosill. I am the
King, dammit!'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has always struck me how well our glorious King resembles the
portraits one sees displayed of him in paintings and in the
profiles which grace our coins. I was fortunate enough to have the
opportunity to study those magnificent features that mid-Xamis, in
the King's private apartments, while the Doctor treated the
duelling wound and the King stood, clad in a long gown with one
sleeve rolled up, in silhouette against the luminous expanse of an
ancient plaster window, face raised and jaw set, as the Doctor
worked at his out-held arm.</p>

<p>What a noble visage! What a regal demeanour! A mane of
majestically curling blond hair, a brow of intelligence and stern
wisdom, clear, flashing eyes the colour of the summer sky, a
sharply defined, heroic nose, a broad, gracefully cultured mouth
and a proud, brave chin, all set on the frame both strong and lithe
which would be the envy of an athlete in his prime (and the King is
in his most magnificent middle-age, when most men have started to go
to fat). They do say that King Quience is excelled in his
appearance and physique only by his late father, Drasine (whom they
are already calling Drasine the Great, I am happy to report. And
rightly so).</p>

<p>'Oh, Sir! Oh dear! Oh my goodness! Oh, help! Oh, what a
calamity! Oh!'</p>

<p>'Leave us, Wiester,' the King said, sighing.</p>

<p>'Sir! Yes, Sir. Immediately, Sir.' The fat chamberlain, still
alternately waving and kneading his hands, left the apartments,
muttering and moaning.</p>

<p>'I thought you had armour to stop this sort of thing happening,
sir,' the Doctor said. She wiped the last of the blood away with a
swab which she then handed to me for disposal. I handed her the
alcohol in exchange. She soaked another swab and applied it to the
gash on the King's bicep. The wound was a couple of fingers long
and a couple of pinches deep.</p>

<p>'Ouch!'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, sir.'</p>

<p>'Aow! <em>Aow!</em> Are you sure this isn't some quackery of your own,
Vosill?'</p>

<p>'The alcohol kills the ill humours which can infect a wound,'
the Doctor said frostily. 'Sir.'</p>

<p>'As does, you claim, mouldy bread,' the King snorted.</p>

<p>'It has that effect.'</p>

<p>'And sugar.'</p>

<p>'That too, sir, in an emergency.'</p>

<p>'Sugar,' the King said, shaking his head.</p>

<p>'Don't you, sir?'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Have armour?'</p>

<p>'Of course we have armour, you imbecile&mdash; Aow! Of course we have
armour, but you don't wear it in the <em>duelling chamber</em>. In
the name of Providence, if you were going to wear armour you might
as well not duel at all!'</p>

<p>'But I thought it was a practice, sir. For real fighting.'</p>


<p>'Well, of course it's a <em>practice</em>, Vosill. If it wasn't a practice
the fellow who cut me wouldn't have stopped and damn near fainted,
he'd have leapt in for the kill, if it was that sort of duel.
Anyway, yes, it was a practice.' The King shook his magnificent
head and stamped one foot. '<em>Damn</em> me, Vosill, you ask the
most stupid questions.'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, sir.'</p>

<p>'It's only a scratch, anyway.' The King looked around, then
gestured at a footman standing by the main doors, who quickly went
to a table and drew his majesty a glass of wine.</p>

<p>'How much less than a scratch is an insect bite,' the Doctor
said. 'And yet people die from those, sir.'</p>

<p>'They do?' the King said, accepting the wine goblet.</p>

<p>'So I've been taught. A poisonous humour transmitted from the
insect to the bloodstream.'</p>

<p>'Hmm,' the King said, looking sceptical. He glanced at the
wound. 'Still just a scratch. Adlain wasn't very impressed.' He
drank.</p>

<p>'I imagine it would take a great deal to impress Guard Commander
Adlain,' the Doctor said, though not I think unkindly.</p>

<p>The King gave a small smile. 'You don't like Adlain, do you,
Vosill?'</p>

<p>The Doctor flexed her brows. 'I don't regard him as a friend,
sir, but equally I don't regard him as an enemy, either. We both
seek to serve you in our appointed ways according to the skills at
our command.'</p>

<p>The King's eyes narrowed as he considered this. 'Spoken like a
politician, Vosill,' he said quietly. 'Expressed like a
courtier.'</p>

<p>'I shall take that as a compliment, sir.'</p>

<p>He watched her clean out the wound for a while. 'Still, perhaps
you ought to be wary of him, eh?'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked up. I believe she might have been surprised.
'If your majesty says so.'</p>

<p>'And Duke Wen,' the King said with a grunt. 'Your ears should
burn when he talks about women being doctors, or for that matter
women being anything other than whores, wives and mothers.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, sir,' the Doctor said through gritted teeth. She looked
to me to ask for something, then saw that I already held the
appropriate jar in my hand. I was rewarded with a smile and a nod
of appreciation. I took the alcohol-soaked swab and dropped it in
the rubbish bag.</p>

<p>'What's that?' the King said, brows furrowed in suspicion.</p>

<p>'It's an ointment, sir.'</p>

<p>'I can <em>see</em> it's an ointment, Vosill. What does it&mdash; Oh.'</p>

<p>'As you feel, sir, it dulls the pain. Also it fights the
particles of ill humour which infest the air, and aids the healing
process.'</p>

<p>'Is that like the stuff you put on my leg that time, on the
abscess?'</p>

<p>'It is, sir. What an excellent memory your majesty has. That was
the first time I treated you, I believe.'</p>

<p>The King caught sight of his reflection in one of the great
mirrors which adorned his private resting chambers and drew himself
up straighter. He looked at the footman by the door, who came over
and took the wine goblet from him, then the King lifted up his chin
and pushed his hand through his hair, shaking his head so that his
locks, which had been flattened by the sweat under his duelling
half-mask, fell bouncing free again.</p>

<p>'That's right,' he said, inspecting his noble outline in the
looking glass. 'I was in a poor state, from what I can recall. All
the saw-bones thought I was going to die.'</p>

<p>'I was very glad your majesty sent for me,' the Doctor said
quietly, binding the wound.</p>

<p>'It was an abscess that killed my father, you know,' the King
told the Doctor.</p>

<p>'So I have heard, sir.' She smiled up at him. 'But it did not
kill you.'</p>

<p>The King smiled and looked ahead. 'No. Indeed.' Then he
grimaced. 'But then he did not suffer from my twisted guts, or my
aching back, or my other aches.'</p>

<p>'He is not recorded as mentioning such things, sir,' the Doctor
said, rolling the dressing round and round the King's mightily
muscled arm.</p>

<p>He looked at her sharply. 'Are you suggesting I'm a whiner,
Doctor?'</p>

<p>Vosill looked up, surprised. 'Why, no, sir. You bear your many
unfortunate ills with great fortitude.' She kept on unwinding the
bandage. (The Doctor has bandages specially made for her by the
court tailor, and insists upon the cleanliness of the conditions of their manufacture.
Even so, before she will use then she boils them in already-boiled
water which she has treated with the bleaching powder she also has
specially made for her, by the palace apothecary.) 'Indeed your
majesty is to be extolled for his willingness to talk of his
ailments,' the Doctor told him. 'Some people &mdash; taking stoicism,
manly pride or simple reticence beyond its fit limit &mdash; suffer in
silence until they are at death's door, and then promptly pass over
that threshold, when a word, a single complaint at a much earlier
stage in their illness would have let a doctor diagnose the
problem, treat it and cause them to live. Pain, or even just
discomfort, is like the warning sent by a frontier guard, sir. You
are free to choose to ignore it, but you should not be unduly
surprised if you are subsequently over-run by invaders.'</p>

<p>The King gave a small laugh and looked on the Doctor with a
tolerant, kindly expression. 'Your cautionary military metaphor is
duly appreciated, Doctor.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, sir.' The Doctor adjusted the bandage so that it
would sit properly on the King's arm. 'There was a note on my door
which said you wanted to see me, sir. I assume whatever that was
about must have predated your fencing injury.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' the King said. 'Yes.' He put one hand up to the back of
his neck. 'My neck. That stiffness again. You might look at it
later.'</p>


<p>'Of course, sir.'</p>


<p>The King sighed, and I could not help noticing that his stance
altered, so that he was less upright, less regal, even. 'Father had
the constitution of a haul. They say he once took on a yoke and
pulled one of the poor beasts backwards through a paddy.'</p>


<p>'I heard it was a calf, sir.'</p>


<p>'So? A haul <em>calf</em> weighs more than most men,' the King said
sharply. 'And besides, were you there, Doctor?'</p>

<p>'I was not, sir.'</p>

<p>'No. You weren't.' The King stared into the distance, a look of
sadness on his face. 'But, you're right, I think it was a calf.' He
sighed again. 'The old stories talk of the kings of old lifting
hauls &mdash; <em>adult</em> hauls, Doctor &mdash; lifting hauls above their heads and
then throwing them at their enemies. Ziphygr of Anlios ripped a
wild ertheter in half with his bare hands, Scolf the Strong tore
off the head of the monster Gruissens with one hand, Mimarstis the
Sompolian&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Might these not be simply legends, sir?'</p>

<p>The King stopped talking and looked straight ahead for a moment
(I confess I froze), then he turned as far round towards the Doctor
as he could with the bandage still being wound. 'Doctor Vosill,' he
said quietly.</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>'You do not interrupt the King.'</p>

<p>'Did I interrupt you, sir?'</p>

<p>'You did. Do you know nothing?'</p>

<p>'App&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Do they teach you naught in this archipelago anarchy of yours?
Do they instil no manners whatsoever in their children and their
women? Are you so degenerate and impolite that you have no
conception of how to behave towards your betters?'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked hesitantly at the King.</p>

<p>'You may answer,' he told her.</p>

<p>'The archipelagic republic of Drezen is notorious for its ill
manners, sir,' the Doctor said, with every appearance of meekness.
'I am ashamed to report that I am considered one of the polite
ones. I do apologise.'</p>

<p>'My father would have had you flogged, Vosill. And that was <em>if</em>
he'd decided to take pity on you as a foreigner and therefore
unused to our ways.'</p>

<p>'I am grateful that in your sympathy and understanding you
surpass your noble father, sir. I will try never to interrupt you
again.'</p>

<p>'Good.' The King resumed his proud stance. The Doctor kept on
winding the last of the bandage. 'Manners were better in the old
days too,' the King said.</p>

<p>'I'm sure they were,' the Doctor said. 'Sir.'</p>

<p>'The old gods walked amongst our ancestors. The times were
heroic. Great deeds could still be done. We had not fallen from our
strength then. The men were greater and braver and stronger. And
the women were more fair and more graceful.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure it was just as you say, sir.'</p>

<p>'Everything was better then.'</p>

<p>'Just so, sir,' the Doctor said, tearing the end of the bandage
lengthwise.</p>

<p>'Everything just gets...worse,' the King said with another
sigh.</p>

<p>'Hmm,' the Doctor said, securing the dressing with a knot.
'There, sir, is that better?'</p>

<p>The King flexed his arm and shoulder, inspected his bulging arm,
then rolled the gown's sleeve down over the wound. 'How long till I
can fence again?'</p>

<p>'You can fence tomorrow, gently. Pain will let you know when to
stop, sir.'</p>

<p>'Good,' the King said, and clapped the Doctor on the shoulder.
She had to take a step to one side, but looked pleasantly
surprised. I thought I saw a blush on her face. 'Well done,
Vosill.' He looked her up and down. 'Shame you're not a man. You
could learn to fence too, hmm?'</p>

<p>'Indeed, sir.' The Doctor nodded to me and we started to put
away the instruments of her profession.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sick brat's family lived in a pair of filthy, stinking rooms
at the top of a cramped and rickety tenement in the Barrows, above
a street the storm had turned into a rushing brown sewer.</p>

<p>The concierge was not worthy of the name. She was a fat drunken
harridan, a repulsively odoured toll-taker who demanded coin from
the Doctor on the pretext that our coming in from the street with
such filth on our feet and hose would mean she'd be put to extra
work removing it. Judging from the state of the hallway &mdash; or as
much of it as could be made out in the one-lamp gloom &mdash; the city
fathers might as well charge her for bringing the muck of its
interior out on to the streets of the city, but the Doctor just
tutted and dug into her purse. The harridan then demanded and got
more coin for letting the crippled child up the stairs with us. I
knew better than to attempt to say anything on the Doctor's behalf,
and so had to content myself with glaring at the obese nag in the
most threatening way I could.</p>

<p>The way up the narrow, creaking, alarmingly pitched staircase
led us through a variety of stenches. I experienced in turn sewage,
animal ordure, unwashed human bodies, rotting food and some foul
form of cooking. This medley was accompanied by an orchestration of
noises: the buffeting screech of the wind outside, the wail of
babies crying from what seemed like most of the rooms, the shouts,
curses, screams and thuds of an argument behind one half-splintered
door and the woeful-sounding lowing of beasts shackled in the
courtyard.</p>

<p>Raggedly dressed children ran up and down the stairs in front of
us, squealing and grunting like animals. People crowded on to the
cramped and ill-lit landings on each level to watch us pass and
make remarks about the fineness of the Doctor's cloak and the
contents of her big dark bag. I kept a handkerchief to my mouth all
the way up the stairs, and wished I had soaked it in perfume more
recently than I had.</p>

<p>Achieved by a final flight of stairs even more fragilelooking
and shaky than those we had encountered on the way up, the top
floor of this cess-pile was, I swear, swaying in the wind.
Certainly I felt dizzy and sick.</p>

<p>The two cramped, crowded rooms we found ourselves in were
probably unbearably hot in the summer and cold in the winter. The
wind howled through two small windows in the first chamber. They
had probably never had any plaster in them, just a frame with
material for blinds and perhaps some shutter-planks. The shutters
were long gone, probably burned for winter fuel, and the ragged
flaps which were all that remained of the blinds did little to keep
out the gale's blast, letting wind and rain billow in.</p>

<p>In this room ten or more people, from babes-in-arms to shrunken
ancients, huddled on the floor and a single pallet bed. Their
hollow eyes watched as we were ushered quickly towards the room
beyond by the crippled waif who'd brought us to this midden-rack.
We entered this next chamber by pushing through a tattered fabric
door-covering. Behind us, the people muttered to each other with a
harsh, lisping sound that might have been a native dialect or a
foreign language.</p>

<p>This room was darker, its shutters just as absent as in the room
before but its windows covered with the bellying forms of coats or
jackets pinned across the frames. Rain had collected in the sodden
fabric of the garments before flowing in little rivulets from their
bottom edges down the stained plaster of the walls to the floor,
where it had pooled and spread.</p>

<p>The floor was curiously sloped and ridged. We were in one of
those extra storeys that are added to already cheaply built
tenements by builders, landlords and residents who value economy
above safety. There was a slow groaning noise from the walls and a
sharp cracking, snapping noise from overhead. Water leaked from the
sagging ceiling in a handful of places, dripping to the grimy,
strawcovered floor.</p>

<p>A thick-set, wild-haired woman in a gruesomely filthy dress
greeted the Doctor with much wailing and crying and hoarse,
foreign-sounding words and led her through a press of dark,
foul-smelling bodies to a low bed set against the far end of the
room beneath a bowed wall whose lathe showed through straw-hung
lumps of plaster. Something scuttled away along the wall and
disappeared into a long crack near the ceiling.</p>

<p>'How long has she been like this?' I heard the Doctor ask,
kneeling by the lamp-lit bed and opening her bag. I edged forward,
to see a thin girl dressed in rags lying on the bed, her face grey,
her thin dark hair plastered to her forehead, her eyes bulging
behind her tremulous, flickering eyelids while her breath came in
quick, shallow gasps. Her whole body shook and quivered on the bed
and her head twitched and her neck muscles spasmed continually.</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't know!' wailed the woman in the dirty gown who had
greeted the Doctor. Under the unwashed scent she smelled of
something sickly sweet. She sat down heavily on a torn straw
cushion by the bed, making it bulge. She elbowed a few of the other
people around her out of the way and put her head in her hands
while the Doctor felt the sick child's forehead and pulled one of
her eyelids open. 'All day, maybe, Doctor. I don't know.'</p>

<p>'Three days,' said a slight child standing near the head of the
bed, her arms clamped round the thin frame of the crippled one
who'd brought us here.</p>

<p>The Doctor looked at her. 'You're . . . ?'</p>

<p>'Anowir,' the girl replied. She nodded at the slightly older
girl on the bed. 'Zea is my sister.'</p>

<p>'Oh no, not three days, not my poor dear girl!' the woman on the
straw cushion said, rocking back and forth and shaking her head
without looking up. 'No, no, no.'</p>

<p>'We wanted to send for you before now,' Anowir said, looking
from the wild-haired woman to the stricken face of the crippled
girl she was holding and who was holding her, 'but&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh no, no, no,' the fat woman wailed from behind her hands.
Some of the children whispered to each other, in the same tongue
we'd heard in the outer room. The thick-set woman ran her grubby
fingers through her unkempt hair.</p>

<p>'Anowir,' the Doctor said in a kindly fashion to the girl
holding the crippled child, 'can you and some of your brothers and
sisters go down to the docks as fast as you can and find an ice
merchant? Fetch some ice. It doesn't have to be in first-quality
blocks, crushed is fine, in fact it's best. Here.' The Doctor
reached into her purse and counted out some coins. 'How many want
to go?' she asked, looking round the host of mostly young, tearful
faces.</p>

<p>Quickly a number was settled on and she gave them a coin each.
This struck me as far too much for ice at this point in the season,
but the Doctor is unworldly in these matters. 'You may keep any
change,' she told the suddenly eagerlooking children, 'but you must
each bring all you can carry. Apart from anything else,' she said,
smiling, 'it'll help weigh you down in that gale outside and stop
you blowing away. Now, go!'</p>

<p>The room suddenly emptied and only the sick child on the bed,
the fat woman on the cushion &mdash; whom I took to be the invalid's
mother &mdash; and the Doctor and I were left. Some of the people in the
outer room came to peer through the tattered door-cloth, but the
Doctor told them to keep away.</p>

<p>Then she turned to the wild-haired woman. 'You must tell me the
truth, Mrs Elund,' she said. She nodded to me to open her bag while
she pulled the sick child further up the bed and then had me bunch
the straw mattress up underneath her back and head. As I knelt to
this, I could feel the heat coming off the girl's fevered skin.
'Has she been like this for three days?'</p>

<p>'Three, two, four .. . who knows!' wailed the wildhaired woman.
'All I know is my precious daughter is dying! She's going to die!
Oh, Doctor, help her! Help us all, for no one else will!' The
thick-set woman suddenly threw herself, with some awkwardness, off
the cushion and on to the floor, burying her head in the folds of
the Doctor's cloak even as the Doctor was unfastening the garment
and trying to free herself from it.</p>

<p>'I'll do what I can, Mrs Elund,' the Doctor said, and then
looked at me as she let the cloak fall off her shoulders and the
girl on the bed started to splutter and cough. 'Oelph, we'll need
that cushion, too.'</p>

<p>Mrs Elund sat up and looked round. 'That's mine!' she cried as I
gathered up the burst cushion and stuffed it behind the sick girl's
head while the Doctor held her upright. 'Where am I to sit? I've
given up my bed for her already!'</p>

<p>'You must find somewhere else,' the Doctor told her. She reached
down and pulled up the girl's thin dress. I looked away as she
examined the child's mid-parts, which appeared inflamed.</p>

<p>The Doctor bent closer, rearranging the child's legs and taking
some instrument from her bag. After a while she put the girl's legs
back together and pulled the patient's dress and skirts back down.
She busied herself with the child's eyes and mouth and nose, and
held her wrist for a while, eyes closed. There was silence in the
room save for the noises of the storm and the occasional sniffle
from Mrs Elund, who had settled on the floor with the Doctor's cape
wrapped half around her. I had the distinct impression the Doctor
was trying to control a desire to shout and scream.</p>

<p>'The money for the song school,' the Doctor said tersely. 'If I
went to the school now, do you think they would tell me it had been
spent there on Zea's lessons?'</p>

<p>'Oh, Doctor, we're a poor family!' the wild-haired woman said,
putting her face in her hands again. 'I can't watch what they all
do! I can't keep watch on what she does with the money I give her!
She does what she wants to do, that one, I tell you! Oh, save her,
Doctor! Please save her!'</p>

<p>The Doctor shifted her position where she knelt and reached in
under the bed. She pulled out a couple of fat clays, one stoppered,
one not. She sniffed the empty clay and shook the stoppered one. It
sloshed. Mrs Elund looked up, her eyes wide. She swallowed. I
caught a whiff from the clay. The smell was the same as that on Mrs
Elund's breath. The Doctor looked at the other woman over the top
of the empty clay. 'How long has Zea known men, Mrs Elund?' the
Doctor asked, replacing the clays under the bed.</p>

<p>'Known men!' the wild-haired woman screeched, sitting upright.
'She&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And on this bed, too, I'd think,' the Doctor said, pulling up
the girl's dress to look at the bed's covers again. 'That's where
she's picked up the infection. Somebody's been too rough with her.
She's too young.' She looked at Mrs Elund with an expression I can
only say I was devoutly glad was not directed at me. Mrs Elund's
jaw worked and her eyes went wide. I thought she was about to
speak, then the Doctor said, 'I understood what the children said
when they left, Mrs Elund. They thought Zea might be pregnant, and
they mentioned the sea captain and the two bad men. Or did I
misunderstand something?'</p>

<p>Mrs Elund opened her mouth, then she went limp and her eyes
closed and she said, 'Oooh . . .' and fell in what looked like a
dead faint to the floor, folding herself on to the Doctor's
cloak.</p>

<p>The Doctor ignored Mrs Elund and busied herself at her bag for a
moment before bringing out a jar of ointment and a small wooden
spatula. She drew on a pair of the rike's bladder gloves she'd had
the Palace hide-tailor make for her and pulled the girl's dress up
once more. I looked away again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Doctor used various of her precious ointments and fluids on
the sick child, telling me as she did so what effect each ought to
have, how this one alleviated the effects of high temperature on
the brain, how this one would fight the infection at its source,
how this one would do the same job from inside the girl's body, and
how this one would give her strength and act as a general tonic
when she recovered. The Doctor had me remove her cloak from
underneath Mrs Elund and then hold the cloak out of a window in the
other room, waiting &mdash; with arms that became increasingly sore &mdash;
until it was saturated with water before bringing it back inside
and placing its dark, sopping folds over the child, whose clothes,
save for a single tatty shift, the Doctor had removed. The girl
continued to shake and twitch, and seemed no better than when we
had arrived.</p>

<p>When Mrs Elund made the noises that indicated she was coming
back from her faint, the Doctor ordered her to find a fire, a
kettle and some clean water to boil. Mrs Elund seemed to resent
this, but left without too many curses muttered under her
breath.</p>

<p>'She's burning up,' the Doctor whispered to herself, one
graceful, long-fingered hand on the child's forehead. It occurred
to me then, for the first time, that the girl might die. 'Oelph,'
the Doctor said, looking at me with worry in her eyes. 'Would you
see if you can find the children? Hurry them up. She needs that
ice.'</p>

<p>'Yes, mistress,' I said wearily, and made for the stairs and
their mixture of sights, sounds and smells. I had just been
starting to think that parts of me were drying off.</p>

<p>I exited into the loud darkness of the storm. Xamis had set by
now and poor Seigen, somewhere beyond the clouds, seemed to have no
more power to penetrate them than an oil lamp. The rain-lashed
streets were deserted and gloomy, full of deep shadows and
buffeting squalls that threatened to bowl me over into the gurgling
open sewer overflowing at the centre of each thoroughfare. I headed
downhill under the darkly threatening bulk of the over-hanging
buildings, in what I imagined must be the direction of the docks,
hoping that I could find my way back and starting to wish that I'd
taken one of the people in the outer room as a guide.</p>

<p>I think sometimes the Doctor forgets that I am not a native of
Haspide. Certainly I have lived here longer than she, for she only
arrived a little over two years ago, but I was born in the city of
Derla, far to the south, and passed the majority of my childhood in
the province of Ormin. Even since I came to Haspide most of the
time I have spent here has been not in the city itself but in the
Palace, or in the summer palace in the Yvenage hills, or on the
road to it or on the way back from it.</p>

<p>I wondered if the Doctor had really sent me out to look for the
children or whether there was some arcane or secret treatment she
intended to carry out which she did not want me to witness. They
say all doctors are secretive &mdash; I have heard that one medical clan
in Oartch kept the invention of birthing forceps secret for the
best part of two generations &mdash; but I had thought Doctor Vosill was
different. Perhaps she was. Perhaps she really did think I'd be
able to make the ice she'd requested arrive quicker, though it
seemed to me there was little I could really do. A cannon boomed
out over the city, marking the end of one watch and the start of
another. The sound was muffled by the storm and seemed almost like
part of it. I buttoned my coat up as far as I could. While I was
doing this the wind whipped my hat off my head and sent it tumbling
down the street until it fetched up in the street's central drain.
I ran after it and lifted it out of the stinking stream, wrinkling
my nose in disgust at the smell. I rinsed it as best I could under
an overflowing drain, wrung it out and sniffed at it, then threw it
away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found the docks after a while, by which time I was thoroughly
soaked again. I hunted in vain for an ice warehouse, and was told
in no uncertain terms, by the odd sea-faring and trading types I
discovered in a few small ramshackle offices and a couple of
crowded, smoke-stuffed taverns, that I was in the wrong place to
find ice warehouses. This was the salt-fish market. I was able to
confirm this when I slipped on some fish guts lying rotting under a
windruffled puddle and was nearly pitched into the troubled,
tossing waters of the dock alongside. I could have got wetter as a
result of such a fall, but unlike the Doctor I cannot swim.
Eventually I found myself being forced &mdash; by a tall stone wall which
started sheer on a wind-whipped quay and extended off into the
distance &mdash; to walk back uphill into the maze of tenements.</p>

<p>The children had beaten me to it. I arrived back at the accursed
building, ignored the frightful threats of the foul-smelling
harridan at the door, dragged myself up the steps past the smells
and through the cacophony of sounds, following a trail of dark
water spots to the top floor, where the ice had been delivered and
the girl packed in it, still covered in the Doctor's cloak and now
again surrounded by her siblings and friends.</p>

<p>The ice arrived too late. We had arrived too late, perhaps by a
day or so. The Doctor struggled through into the night, trying
everything she could think of, but the girl slipped away from her
in a blazing fever the ice could not alleviate, and sometime around
when the storm started to abate, in the midnight of Xamis, while
Seigen still struggled to pierce the tattering dark shrouds of the
storm clouds and the voices of the singers were carried away and
lost on the quickness of the wind, the child died.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="chapter">4. THE BODYGUARD</h3>

<p>' Let me search him, General.'</p>

<p>'We can't search him, DeWar, he's an ambassador.'</p>

<p>'ZeSpiole is
right, DeWar. We can't treat him as though he's some peasant
supplicant.'</p>

<p>'Of course not, DeWar,' said BiLeth, who was the Protector's
advisor on most matters foreign. He was a tall, thin, imperious man
with long, scant hair and a short, considerable temper. He did his
best to look down his very thin nose at the taller DeWar. 'What
sort of ruffians do you want us to appear?'</p>

<p>'The ambassador certainly comes with all the usual diplomatic
accoutrements,' UrLeyn said, striding onwards along the
terrace.</p>

<p>'From one of the Sea Companies, sir,' DeWar protested. 'They're
hardly an Imperial delegation of old. They have the clothes and the
jewels and the chains of office, but do any of them match?'</p>

<p>'Match?' UrLeyn said, mystified.</p>

<p>'I think,' ZeSpiole said, 'the chief bodyguard means that all
their finery is stolen.'</p>

<p>'Ha!' BiLeth said, with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>'Aye, and recently, too,' DeWar said.</p>

<p>'Nevertheless,' UrLeyn said. 'In fact, all the more so because
of that.'</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>'All the more so ?'</p>

<p>BiLeth looked confused for a moment, then nodded wisely.</p>

<p>General UrLeyn came to a sudden stop on the white and black
tiles of the terrace. DeWar seemed to stop in the same instant,
ZeSpiole and BiLeth a moment later. Those following them along the
terrace between the private quarters and the formal court chambers
 &mdash; generals, aides, scribes and clerks, the usual attenders &mdash;
 bumped into each scribes
other with a muffled clattering of armour, swords and writing
boards as they drew to a stop behind.</p>

<p>'The Sea Companies may be all the more important now that the
old Empire is in tatters, my friends,' General UrLeyn said, turning
in the sunlight to address the tall, balding figure of BiLeth, the
still taller and shadow-dark bodyguard and the smaller, older man
in the uniform of the palace guard. ZeSpiole &mdash; a thin, wizened man
with deeply lined eyes &mdash; had been DeWar's predecessor as chief
bodyguard. Now instead of being charged with the immediate
protection of UrLeyn's person he was in command of the palace guard
and therefore with the security of the whole palace. 'The Sea
Companies' knowledge,' UrLeyn said, 'their skills, their ships,
their cannons . . . they have all become more important. The
collapse of the Empire has brought us a surfeit of those who call
themselves Emperors . . .'</p>

<p>'At least three, brother!' RuLeuin called.</p>

<p>'Precisely,' UrLeyn said, smiling. 'Three Emperors, a lot of
happy Kings, or at least Kings who are happier than they were under
the old Empire, and indeed a few more people calling themselves
Kings who would not have dared to do so under the old regime.'</p>

<p>'Not to mention one for whom the title King would be an insult,
indeed a demotion, sir!' YetAmidous said, appearing at the
General's shoulder.</p>

<p>UrLeyn clapped the taller man's back. 'You see, DeWar, even my
good friend General YetAmidous rightly numbers me with those who
have benefited from the demise of the old order and reminds me that
it was neither my cunning and guile nor exemplary generalship which
led me to the exalted position I now hold,' UrLeyn said, his eyes
twinkling.</p>

<p>'General!' YetAmidous said, his broad, furrowed, rather
doughy-looking face taking on a hurt expression. 'I meant to imply
no such thing!'</p>

<p>The Grand Aedile UrLeyn laughed and clapped his friend on the
shoulder again. 'I know, Yet, don't worry. But you take the point,
DeWar?' he said, turning to him again, yet raising his voice to
make it clear he was addressing all the rest of those present, not
just his chief bodyguard. 'We have been able,' UrLeyn told them,
'to take more control of our own affairs because we do not have the
threat of Imperial interference hanging over us. The great forts
are deserted, the drafts are returned home or have become aimless
bands of brigands, the fleets were sunk vying with one another or
left rotting, deserted.  A few of the ships had commanders who could
hold them together
with respect rather than fear, and some of those ships are now part
of the Sea Companies. The older Companies have found a new power
now that the Empire's ships no longer harry them. With that power
they have a new responsibility, a new station in life. They have
become the protectors, not the raptors, the guards, not the
raiders.'</p>

<p>UrLeyn looked round all the people in the group, standing
blinking on the terrace of black and white tiles under the fierce
glare of Xamis and Seigen at their mid.</p>

<p>BiLeth nodded even more wisely than before. 'Indeed, sir. I have
often&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The Empire was the parent,' UrLeyn went on, 'and the Kingdoms &mdash;
and the Sea Companies, to a lesser degree &mdash; were the children. We
were left to play amongst ourselves for much of the time, unless we
made too much noise, or broke something, whereupon the adults would
come and punish us. Now the father and the mother are dead, the
degenerate relatives dispute the will, but it is too late, and the
children have grown to young adulthood, left the nursery and taken
over the house. Indeed, we have quit the tree-house to occupy the
whole estate, gentlemen, and we must not show too much disrespect
to those who used to play with their boats in the pond.' He smiled.
'The least we can do is treat their ambassadors as we would wish
ours to be treated.' He clapped BiLeth on the shoulder, making the
taller man waver. 'Don't you think?'</p>

<p>'Absolutely, sir,' BiLeth said, with a scornful look at
DeWar.</p>

<p>'There you are,' UrLeyn said. He turned on his heel. 'Come.' He
paced away.</p>

<p>DeWar was still at his side, a piece of blackness moving across
the tiles. ZeSpiole had to walk fast to catch up. BiLeth took
longer strides. 'Delay the meeting, sir,' DeWar said. 'Let it be
held in less formal circumstances.  Invite the ambassador to meet you
. . . in the baths, say, then&mdash;'</p>

<p>'In the <em>baths</em>, DeWar,' the General scoffed.</p>

<p>'How ridiculous!' BiLeth said.</p>

<p>ZeSpiole just chuckled.</p>

<p>'I have seen this ambassador, sir,' DeWar told the General as
the doors were opened for them and they entered the coolness of the
great hall, where half a hundred courtiers, officials and military
men were waiting, scattered about its plain stone floor. 'He does
not fill me with confidence, sir,' DeWar said quietly, quickly
looking round. 'In fact he fills me with suspicion. Especially as
he has requested a private meeting.'</p>

<p>They stopped near the doors. The General nodded to a small
alcove set into the thickness of the wall where there was just
enough room for two to sit. 'Excuse us, BiLeth, Commander
ZeSpiole,' he said. ZeSpiole looked discomfited, but nodded. BiLeth
drew back a little as though profoundly insulted, but then bowed
gravely. UrLeyn and DeWar sat in the alcove. The General held up
one hand to prevent the people approaching them from coming too
close. ZeSpiole held out his arms, keeping people back.</p>

<p>'What do you find suspicious, DeWar?' he asked softly.</p>

<p>'He is like no ambassador I've ever seen. He doesn't have the
look of one.'</p>

<p>UrLeyn laughed quietly. 'What, is he dressed in seaboots and a
storm cape? Are there barnacles on his heels and seabird-shit on
his cap? Really, DeWar. . .'</p>

<p>'I mean his face, his expression, his eyes, his whole bearing. I
have seen hundreds of ambassadors, sir, and they are as various as
you might expect, and more. They are unctuous, open-seeming,
blustering, resigned, modest, nervous, severe . . . every type. But
they all seem to care, sir, they all seem to have some sort of
common interest in their office and function. This one . . .' DeWar
shook his head.</p>

<p>UrLeyn put his hand on the other man's shoulder. 'This one just
feels wrong to you, is that right?'</p>


<p>'I confess you put it no better than I, sir.'</p>


<p>UrLeyn laughed. 'As I said, DeWar, we live in a time when values
and roles and people are changing. You do not expect me to behave
as other rulers have behaved, do you?'</p>


<p>'No, sir, I do not.'</p>


<p>'Just so we cannot expect every functionary of every new power
to conform to expectations formed in the days of the old
Empire.'</p>

<p>'I understand that, sir. I hope I am already taking that into
account. What I am talking about is simply a feeling. But it is, if
I may term it so, a professional feeling. And it is partly for
those, sir, that you employ me.' DeWar searched his leader's eyes
to see if he was convinced, if he had succeeded in transmitting any
of the apprehension he felt. But the Protector's eyes still
twinkled, amused more than concerned. DeWar shifted uncomfortably
on the stone bench. 'Sir,' he said, leaning closer, his expression
pained. 'I was told the other day, by someone whose opinion I know
you value, that I am incapable of being other than a bodyguard,
that my every waking moment, even when I am meant to be relaxing,
is spent thinking of how better to keep you from harm.' He took a
deep breath. 'My point is that if I live only to shield you from
danger and think of nothing else even when I might, how much more
must I attend to my anxieties when I am at the very core of my
duty, as now?'</p>

<p>UrLeyn regarded him for a moment. 'You ask me to trust your
mistrust,' he said quietly.</p>


<p>'Now the Protector does put it better than I could have.'</p>


<p>UrLeyn smiled. 'And why would any of the Sea Companies wish me
dead in the first place?'</p>

<p>DeWar dropped his voice still further. 'Because you are thinking
of building a Navy, sir.'</p>


<p>'Am I?' UrLeyn asked with seeming surprise.</p>

<p>'Aren't you, sir?'</p>

<p>'Why would anyone think that?'</p>


<p>'You turned over some of the Royal Forests to the people, and
then recently introduced the condition that some of the older trees
might be thinned.'</p>


<p>'They're dangerous.'</p>


<p>'They are healthy, sir, and of the age and shape for ships'
timbers. Then there is the Mariners' Refuge in Tyrsk, a naval
college in the making, and&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Enough. Have I been so indiscreet? Are the Sea Companies' spies
so numerous and so perceptive?'</p>

<p>'And you have held talks with Haspidus and Xinkspar about
enlisting, I'd imagine, the wealth of one and the skills of the
other in the formation of such a Navy.'</p>

<p>UrLeyn looked troubled now. 'You know about this? You must
eavesdrop from a great distance, DeWar.'</p>

<p>'I hear nothing that you would not expect me to hear through
simple proximity, sir. What I hear, without searching them out,
are rumours. People are not stupid and functionaries have their
specialities, sir, their areas of expertise. When an ex-admiral
comes to call, one may guess it is not to discuss breeding better
pack animals for crossing the Breathless Plains.'</p>

<p>'Hmm,' UrLeyn said, looking out at the people gathered around
them but not seeing them. He nodded. 'You can draw the blinds in a
brothel, but people still know what you're doing.'</p>


<p>'Exactly, sir.'</p>


<p>UrLeyn slapped his knee and made to stand. DeWar was on his feet
first. 'Very well, DeWar, to humour you, we'll meet in the painted
chamber. And we'll make the meeting more private even than he has
asked for, just me and him. You may eavesdrop. Are you
mollified?'</p>


<p>'Sir.'</p>

<p class="chapter"><em>*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>*</em></p>


<p>Fleet Captain Oestrile, ambassador of the Kep's Haven Sea
Company, dressed in an ornate rendition of a nautical uniform, with
long turned-over boots of blue hide, trousers of grey pike-fish
skin and a thick, high-collared frock coat of aquamarine edged with
gold &mdash; all topped by a tricorn hat embellished with angel-bird
feathers &mdash; strode slowly into the painted chamber in the palace of
Vorifyr.</p>

<p>The ambassador walked down a narrow carpet of gold thread which
ended at a small stool set a couple of strides from the front of
the only other article of furniture which the gleaming wooden floor
supported, namely a small dais topped by a plain chair on which sat
the Prime Protector, First General and Grand Aedile of the
Protectorate of Tassasen, General UrLeyn.</p>

<p>The ambassador took off his hat and executed a small bow to the
Protector, who motioned the ambassador to the stool. The ambassador
looked at the low stool for a moment, then unbuttoned a couple of
buttons at the lower edge of his coat and sat carefully, laying his
extravagantly feathered hat to one side. He had no obvious weapons,
not even a ceremonial sword, though around his neck was a belt
supporting a stout cylinder of polished hide, with a buttoned cap
at one end and finished with inscribed gold filigree. The
ambassador looked round the walls of the chamber.</p>

<p>The walls were painted in a series of panels depicting the
various parts of the old Kingdom of Tassasen: a forest full of
game, a dark and towering castle, a bustling city square, a harem,
a pattern of fields sectioning a flood plain, and so on. If the
subjects were relatively mundane, the artwork was almost
definitively so. People who had heard of the painted chamber &mdash;
which was rarely opened and even more rarely used &mdash; and who
expected something special, were invariably disappointed. The
paintings were, it was generally agreed, rather dull and
unexceptional.</p>

<p>'Ambassador Oestrile,' the Protector said. He was dressed in his
usual style of the long jacket and trousers he had made the
fashion. The old Tassasen chain of state, with the crown removed,
was his only concession to formality.</p>

<p>'Sire,' the fellow said.</p>

<p>UrLeyn thought he saw in the ambassador's manner a little of
what DeWar had meant. There was a sort of empty gleam in the young
man's gaze. An expression which included such open eyes and such a
wide smile in such a young, shiningly smooth face ought not to be
quite as disquieting as it somehow contrived to be. The fellow was
of average build, his hair was short and dark, though red-powdered
after some fashion UrLeyn did not recognise. He sported fine
whiskers for one so young. Young. Perhaps that was part of it,
thought UrLeyn. Ambassadors tended to be older and fatter. Well, he
should not talk of changing times and changing roles and then be
himself surprised.</p>


<p>'Your journey?' UrLeyn asked. 'I trust it was unexciting?'</p>


<p>'Unexciting?' the young fellow said, seemingly confused. 'How
so?'</p>

<p>'I meant safe,' the Protector said. 'Your journey was safe?'</p>

<p>The fellow looked relieved for a moment. 'Ah,' he said, smiling
broadly and nodding. 'Yes. Safe. Our journey was safe. Very safe.'
He smiled again.</p>

<p>UrLeyn began to wonder if the young fellow was entirely right in
the head. Perhaps he was young for an ambassador because he was
some doting father's favourite son, and the father was blind to the
fact the lad was soft in the brain. He didn't speak Imperial very
well, either, but UrLeyn had heard a few strange accents from those
who were of the nautical powers.</p>

<p>'Well, ambassador,' he said, holding his hands out to each side.
'You asked for an audience.'</p>

<p>The young man's eyes went wider still. 'Yes. An audience.' He
slowly took the belt from round his neck and then looked down at
the polished hide cylinder in his lap. 'First of all, sir,' he
said, 'I have a gift for you. From the Fleet Captain Vritten.' He
looked up expectantly at UrLeyn.</p>

<p>'I confess I have not heard of Fleet Captain Vritten, but
continue.'</p>

<p>The young fellow cleared his throat. He wiped sweat from his
brow. Perhaps, UrLeyn thought, he has a fever. It is a little warm
in here, but insufficiently so to make a man sweat like that. The
Sea Companies spend much of their time in the tropics so it cannot
be that he is unused to heat, sea breezes or not.</p>

<p>The captain undid the buttoned end of the cylinder and withdrew
another cylinder, also clad in gold-inscribed hide, though its ends
appeared to be gold, or brass, and one end was tapered by a series
of shining metal rings. 'What I have here, sir,' the ambassador
said, looking down at the cylinder, which he now held in both
hands, 'is a seeing-piece. An optiscope, or telescope as such
instruments are also known.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' UrLeyn said. 'I have heard of such things. Naharajast,
the last Imperial mathematician, claimed to have used one directed
at the skies to make his predictions concerning the fire-rocks
which appeared in the year of the Empire's fall. Last year an
inventor &mdash; or someone who claimed to be an inventor &mdash; came to our
palace and showed us one. I had a look through it myself. It was
interesting. The view was cloudy, but it was undeniably
closer.'</p>

<p>The young ambassador seemed not to hear. 'The telescope is a
fascinating device . . . a most fascinating device, sir, and this
one is a particularly fine example.' He pulled the device apart so
that it clicked out to three or so times its compacted length, then
held it up to one eye, looking at UrLeyn, then round the painted
panels of the room. UrLeyn formed the impression he was hearing a
memorised script. 'Hmm,' the young ambassador said, nodding his
head. 'Extraordinary. Would you care to try it, sir?' He stood and
held out the instrument to the Protector, who motioned the
ambassador to approach. Clutching the hide instrument's protective
cylinder awkwardly in his other hand, the captain stepped forward,
offering the eye-piece end of the device to UrLeyn, who leant
forward in his chair and duly took hold of it. The ambassador let
go of the thicker end of the instrument. It began to fall to the
floor.</p>

<p>'Oh, heavy, isn't it?' UrLeyn said, quickly bringing his other
hand round to save the device. He had almost to jump out of the
chair to keep his balance, going down on one knee towards the young
captain, who took a single step back.</p>

<p>Ambassador Oestrile's hand suddenly held a long, thin dagger
which he swept up and then brought swinging down. UrLeyn saw this
even as his knee hit the dais and he finally caught the
seeing-piece. With his hands full, still off-balance and kneeling
beneath the other man, UrLeyn knew instantly that there was nothing
he could do to parry the blow.</p>

<p>The crossbow bolt slammed into Ambassador Oestrile's head an
instant after glancing off the high collar of his coat. The bolt
lodged in his skull just above his left ear, most of its length
protruding. If either man had had the time and inclination to look,
they would have seen that a small hole had appeared in the painting
of the bustling city square. Oestrile staggered back still
clutching the dagger, his feet slipping on the polished wooden
floor. UrLeyn let himself fall back against the chair, putting both
hands to the eye-piece end of the telescope. He started to swing it
back behind him, thinking to use it as a club.</p>

<p>Ambassador Oestrile gave a roaring bellow of pain and rage, put
one hand to the crossbow bolt and gripped it, shaking his head,
then suddenly threw himself forward again at UrLeyn, dagger
first.</p>

<p>With a resounding crash DeWar burst through the thin plaster
panel depicting the city square. A wave of dust rolled out across
the gleaming floor and plaster shards scattered everywhere as
DeWar, sword already drawn, thrust the blade straight at the ambassador's
midriff. The blade
broke. DeWar's momentum carried him onwards so that he side-charged
into the ambassador. Still roaring, the ambassador was toppled to
the floor with a thud, waving his dagger. DeWar threw away the
broken sword, spun to one side and drew his own dagger.</p>

<p>UrLeyn had dropped the heavy telescope and stood. He drew a
small knife from his jacket and took shelter behind the tall chair.
Oestrile reared to his feet, the crossbow bolt still in his skull.
His boots struggled to find purchase on the polished wooden floor
as he stumbled towards the Protector. DeWar, bare footed, was on
him before he'd taken half a step, coming quickly up behind him,
putting one hand over his face and pulling his head back with
fingers stuck into the man's nostrils and one eye. Ambassador
Oestrile screamed as DeWar sliced his dagger across the man's
exposed throat. Blood sprayed and bubbled as the scream was
drowned.</p>

<p>Oestrile crashed to his knees, finally dropped the dagger, then
fell sideways, neck spurting blood on to the gleaming floor.</p>

<p>'Sir?' DeWar asked UrLeyn breathlessly, still half watching the
body twitching on the floor. Sounds of a commotion came from
outside the chamber's doors. Thuds sounded. 'Sir! Protector!
General!' a dozen voices babbled.</p>

<p>'I'm fine! Stop breaking the damn door down!' UrLeyn shouted.
The commotion became a little less intense. He looked at where the
painted plaster scene of the busy city square had been. In the
little cupboard-sized room which had been revealed behind there was
a stout wooden post with a crossbow fastened to it. UrLeyn looked
back at DeWar, and put his own small knife back in its pocket
sheath. 'No damage done, thank you, DeWar. And you?'</p>

<p>'I am uninjured too, sir. Sorry I had to kill him.' He looked
down at the body, which gave out one final bubbling sigh and then
seemed to collapse in on itself a little. The pool of blood on the
floor was deep and dark and still spreading viscously. DeWar knelt,
keeping his dagger at what was left of the man's throat as he felt
for a pulse. .</p>

<p>'Never mind,' the Protector said. 'Took some killing, too, did
you not think?' He gave an almost girlish chuckle.</p>

<p>'I think some of his strength and his bravery came from a potion
or some such drug-brew, sir.'</p>

<p>'Hmm,' UrLeyn said, then looked to the doors. 'Will you shut
up!' he yelled. 'I'm perfectly all right, but this piece of shit
tried to kill me! Palace guard?'</p>


<p>'Aye, sir! Five present!' shouted a muffled voice.</p>


<p>'Get Commander ZeSpiole. Tell him to find the rest of the
diplomatic mission and arrest them. Clear everybody away from those
doors, then enter. Nobody but the palace guards are allowed in here
until I say so. Got all that?'</p>

<p>'Sir!' The commotion intensified for a while, then began to
subside again until there was almost no noise in the painted
chamber.</p>

<p>DeWar had unbuttoned the failed assassin's coat. 'Chain mail,'
he said, fingering the coat's lining. He tapped the garment's
collar. 'And metal.' He gripped the shaft of the crossbow bolt,
strained, then stood and put one bare foot on Ambassador Oestrile's
head, eventually pulling the bolt free with a delicate crunching
noise. 'No wonder it was deflected.'</p>

<p>UrLeyn stepped to the side of the dais. 'Where did the dagger
come from? I didn't see.'</p>

<p>DeWar crossed to the tall chair, leaving bloody footprints. He
lifted first the telescope and then the hide cylinder it had been
transported within. He peered into the case. 'There's some sort of
clip at the bottom.' He inspected the telescope. 'There is no glass
at the large end. The dagger must have nested inside the device
when it was inside the case.'</p>


<p>'Sir?' a voice came from the door.</p>


<p>'What?' UrLeyn shouted.</p>

<p>'Guard Sergeant HieLiris and three others here, sir.'</p>

<p>'Come in,' UrLeyn told them. The guards entered, looking warily
about. All looked surprised at the hole where the city painting had
been. 'You have not seen that,' the Protector told them. They
nodded. DeWar stood cleaning his dagger on a piece of cloth. UrLeyn
stepped forward and kicked the dead man in the shoulder, sending
him flopping on to his back.</p>

<p>'Take this away,' he told the guards. Two of them sheathed their
swords and took one end of the body each.</p>

<p>'Better take a limb each, lads,' DeWar told them. 'That coat's
heavy.'</p>

<p>'See to the clear-up, will you, DeWar?' asked UrLeyn.</p>

<p>'I should be at your side, sir. If this is a determined attack
there might be two assassins, the second waiting for us to relax
when we think the attack has failed.'</p>

<p>UrLeyn drew himself up and took a deep breath. 'Don't worry
about me. I'm going off to lie down now,' he said.</p>

<p>DeWar frowned. 'Are you sure you're all right, sir?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm fine, DeWar,' the Protector said, following the trail
of blood as the guards carried the body to the doors. 'I'm going
off to lie down on top of somebody very young and plump and firm.'
He grinned back at DeWar from the doors. 'Proximity to death does
this to me,' he announced. He laughed, looking down at the trail of
blood, then at the black pool of it by the dais. 'I should have
been an undertaker.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="chapter">5. THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p>Master, it was now about the time of year when the Court works
itself into the most excited and febrile state as everyone prepares
for the Circuition and the move to the Summer Palace. The Doctor
was busy with her preparations just as everybody else was busy with
theirs, though of course in her case there might have been expected
to be an added excitement given that this would be her first
Circuition. I did all that I could to help her, though I was
constrained in this for a while by a slight fever which kept me in
my bed for a few days.</p>

<p>I confess I hid the symptoms of my illness for as long as I
could, feeling that the Doctor would think me weak, and also
because I had heard from the apprentices of other doctors that
however kindly and pleasant their masters might be with their
paying patients, when their own devoted helpers took poorly they
were, to a man (which naturally they all were), notoriously brusque
and unsympathetic.</p>

<p>Doctor Vosill was, however, a very agreeable and understanding
doctor to me while I was ill, and tended to my needs as though she
were my mother (which I do not think she is quite old enough to
be).</p>

<p>I would not record anything beyond my brief infirmity, and might
even have skipped over it entirely, save to explain to my Master
why there was a gap in my reports, but for the following, which
struck me as possibly shedding some light on the Doctor's
mysterious past before she appeared in the city two years ago.</p>

<p>I was, I freely confess, in a strange state at the height of my
sickness, devoid of appetite, sweating freely and falling into a
state of semi-unconsciousness. Whenever I closed my eyes I was
convinced I was seeing odd and vexatious shapes and figures who
tormented me with their manic and incomprehensible shiftings and
cavortings.</p>

<p>My greatest fear, as may be imagined, was that I might say
something that would reveal to the Doctor the fact that I had been
charged with reporting on her actions. Of course, given that she is
obviously a good and trustworthy person from all that I have seen
and reported so far (and so evidently devoted to our good King), it
may be that no ultimate damage would result from such a revelation,
but however that may be I will of course heed my Master's wishes
and keep my mission a secret.</p>

<p>Be assured then, Master, that no word or hint of that assignment
was transmitted by me, and the Doctor remains none the wiser
regarding these reports. Still, while that most precious confidence
remained locked well within myself, other of my normal inhibitions
and self-constraints had slackened off due to the influence of the
fever, and I found myself on my bed in my cell one day,
while the Doctor &mdash; who had just returned from treating the King (he
had a bad neck around this time, I think) &mdash; was washing my
much-sweated upper body.</p>

<p>'You are too good to me, Doctor. A nurse should do this.'</p>

<p>'A nurse will do this if I am called away to the King again.</p>

<p>'Our dear King! How I love him!' I cried (which was sincere, if
a little embarrassing).</p>

<p>'As do we all, Oelph,' the Doctor said, squeezing water from a
cloth over my chest and &mdash; with what seemed like a thoughtful look &mdash;
rubbing my skin clean. She was crouched at the side of my bed,
which is a very low one due to the constraints of space within my
cell.</p>

<p>I looked into the Doctor's face, which seemed sad just then, I
thought. 'Don't fear, Doctor. You will keep him well! He worries
that his father was the stronger man and he died young, but you'll
keep him well, won't you?'</p>

<p>'What? Yes, yes, of course.'</p>

<p>'Oh! You weren't worried about me, were you?' (And I confess my
heart gave a little leap within my hot and breathless chest, for
what young man would not be taken with the idea of a good and
handsome woman, especially one tending so intimately to his bodily
needs as at that point, worrying about and caring for him?) 'Don't
worry,' I said, putting out a hand. 'I'm not going to die.' She
looked uncertain, so I added, 'Am I?'</p>

<p>'No, Oelph,' she said, and smiled kindly. 'No, you're not going
to die. You're young and strong and I'll look after you. Another
half-day and you should start to come round again.' She looked down
at the hand I had extended to her, which I now realised was on her
knee. I gulped.</p>

<p>'Ah, this old dagger of yours,' I said, not so fevered that I
could not feel embarrassed. I tapped the old knife's pommel where
it protruded from the top of the Doctor's boot, near where my hand
had rested. 'It has, ah, always fascinated me. What sort of knife
is it? Have you ever had to use it? I dare say it cannot be a
surgical tool. It looks too dull. Or is it some ceremonial token?
What&mdash; ?'</p>

<p>The Doctor smiled and put one hand over my lips, quieting me.
She reached down and pulled the dagger from its sheath in her boot,
handing it to me. 'Here,' she said. I took its battered-looking
length in my hands. 'I'd tell you to be careful,' she said, still
smiling, 'but there's little point.'</p>

<p>'Nor much in the way of edge,' I said, running one sweaty thumb
along it.</p>

<p>The Doctor laughed loudly. 'Why, Oelph, a joke,' she said,
clapping me gently on the shoulder. 'And one that works in many a
language too. You must be getting better.' Her eyes looked
bright.</p>

<p>I felt suddenly shy. 'You have looked after me so well, mistress
. . .' I was not sure what else to say, and so I studied the
dagger. It was a heavy old thing, about a hand and a half long and
made of old steel which had become minutely pitted with small rusty
holes. The blade was slightly bent and the tip had been broken off
and rounded with time. There were a few nicks on each blade-edge,
which truly were so dull one would have to saw away with some force
to cut anything much more robust than a jellyfish. The tusk grip
was pitted too, though on a larger scale. Around the pommel and in
a trio of lines down the length of the grip down to the stop there
were a few semiprecious stones each no bigger than a crop grain,
and many holes where it appeared similar stones had once rested.
The top of the pommel was formed by a large dark smoky stone which,
when I held it up to the light, I could just see through. Round the
pommel's bottom rim what I mistook at first for some wavy carving
was really a line of little pits which had lost all but one of the
small pale stones.</p>

<p>I ran a finger down them. 'You should have this repaired,
mistress,' I told her. 'The palace armourer would oblige, I'm sure,
for the stones do not look expensive and the workmanship is not of
the first order. Let me take it down to the armoury when I am well.
I know the deputy armourer's assistant. It would be no trouble. It
would please me to do something for you.'</p>

<p>'There is no need,' the Doctor said. 'I like it well enough just
as it is. It has sentimental value. I carry it as a keepsake.'</p>

<p>'From whom, mistress?' (The fever! Normally I would not have
been so bold!)</p>

<p>'An old friend,' she said easily, mopping off my chest and then
putting the cloths aside and sitting back on the floor.</p>

<p>'From Drezen?'</p>

<p>'From Drezen,' she nodded. 'Given to me the day I set sail.'</p>

<p>'It was new then?'</p>

<p>She shook her head. 'It was old then.' The thin light of a
Seigen sunset shone through a cracked-open window and reflected
redly on her netted, gathered hair. 'A family heirloom.'</p>

<p>'They do not take very good care of their heirlooms if they let
them fall into such disrepair, mistress. There must be more holes
than stones.'</p>

<p>She smiled. 'The stones that are missing were used to good
effect. Some bought protection in uncultured places where a person
travelling alone is seen more as prey than as guest, and others
paid my way on some of the sea passages that brought me here.'</p>

<p>'They do not look very valuable.'</p>

<p>'They are more highly prized elsewhere, perhaps. But the knife,
or what it carried, kept me safe and it kept me moving. I have
never had to use it &mdash; well, I have had to brandish it and wave it
around a bit &mdash; but I have never had to use it to hurt anyone. And
as you say, that is just as well for me, for it is quite the
dullest knife I have seen since I arrived here.'</p>

<p>'Quite so, mistress. It would not do to have the dullest dagger
in the Palace. All the others are so very sharp.'</p>

<p>She looked at me (and I can only say, she looked at me <em>sharply</em>,
for that was a piercing gaze). She gently took the dagger from me
and rubbed a thumb down one blade. 'I think perhaps I will have you
take it to the armoury, though only to have an edge put on it.'</p>

<p>'They might re-point it too, mistress. A dagger is for
stabbing.'</p>


<p>'Indeed.' She put it back in its sheath.</p>


<p>'Oh, mistress!' I cried, suddenly full of fear. 'I'm sorry!'</p>

<p>'For what, Oelph?' she said, her beautiful face, so concerned,
suddenly close to mine.</p>

<p>'For &mdash; for talking to you like this. For asking you personal
questions. I am only your servant, your apprentice. This is not
seemly.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Oelph,' she said, smiling, her voice soft, her breath cool
on my cheek. 'We can ignore seemliness, at least in private, don't
you think?'</p>

<p>'May we, mistress?' (And I confess my heart, fevered though it
was, leapt at these words, wildly expecting what I knew I could not
expect.)</p>

<p>'I think so, Oelph,' she said, and took my hand in hers and
squeezed it gently. 'You may ask me whatever you like. I can always
say no, and I am not the type to take offence easily. I would like
us to be friends, not just Doctor and apprentice.' She tilted her
head, a quizzical, amused expression on her face. 'Is that all
right with you?'</p>


<p>'Oh, yes, mistress!'</p>


<p>'Good. We'll&mdash;' Then the Doctor cocked her head again, listening
to something. 'There's the door,' she said, rising. 'Excuse
me.'</p>

<p>She returned holding her bag. 'The King,' she said. Her
expression, it seemed to me, was half-regretful, half-radiant.
'Apparently his toes are sore.' She smiled. 'Will you be all right
by yourself, Oelph?'</p>


<p>'Yes, mistress.'</p>


<p>'I'll be back as soon as I can. Then maybe we'll see if you're
ready for something to eat.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a five-day later, I think, that the Doctor was called to
the Slave Master Tunch. His house was an imposing one in the
Merchants' Quarter, overlooking the Grand Canal. Its tall, raised
front doors sat imposingly above the sweeping double staircase
leading from the street, but we were not able to enter that way.
Instead our hired seat was directed to a small quay a few streets
away, where we transferred to a little cabin-punt which took us,
shutters closed, down a side canal and round to the rear of the
building and a small dock hidden from the public waters.</p>

<p>'What is all this about?' the Doctor asked me as the punt's
shutters were opened by the boatman and the vessel bumped against
the dark timbers of a pier. It was well into summer yet still the
place seemed chilly and smelled of dankness and decay.</p>

<p>'Mistress?' I said, fastening a spiced kerchief round my mouth
and nose.</p>


<p>'This secrecy.'</p>


<p>'And why are you doing that?' she asked, obviously annoyed, as a
servant helped the boatman secure the punt.</p>


<p>'What, this, mistress?' I asked, pointing to the kerchief.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said, standing up and rocking our small craft.</p>

<p>'It is to combat the evil humours, mistress.'</p>


<p>'Oelph, I have told you before that infectious agents are
transmitted in breath or bodily fluids, even if they are insect
body fluids,' she said. 'A bad smell by itself will not make you
ill. Thank you.' The servant accepted her bag and laid it carefully
on the small dock. I did not reply. No doctor knows everything and
it is better to be safe than sorry. 'Anyway,' she said, 'I am still
unclear why all this secrecy is required.'</p>

<p>'I think the Slave Master does not want his own doctor to know
of your visit,' I told her as I clambered on to the dock. 'They are
brothers.'</p>

<p>'If this Slaver is so close to death, why isn't his doctor at
his side?' the Doctor said. 'Come to that, why isn't he there as
his brother?' The servant held out a hand to help the Doctor out of
the boat. 'Thank you,' she said again. (She is always thanking
servants. I think the menials of Drezen must be a surly lot. Or
just spoiled.)</p>

<p>'I don't know, mistress,' I confessed.</p>

<p>'The Master's brother is in Trosila, ma'am,' the servant said
(which just goes to show what happens when you start speaking to
servants).</p>

<p>'Is he?' the Doctor said.</p>

<p>The servant opened a small door leading to the rear of the
house. 'Yes, ma'am,' he said, looking nervously at the boatman. 'He
has gone in person to seek some rare earth which is said to help
the condition the Master is suffering from.'</p>

<p>'I see,' the Doctor said. We entered the house. A female servant
met us. She wore a severe black dress and had a forbidding face.
Indeed her expression was so bleak my first thought was that Slave
Master Tunch had died. However, she gave the tiniest of nods to the
Doctor and in a precise, clipped voice said, 'Mistress Vosill?'</p>

<p>'That's me.'</p>

<p>She nodded at me. 'And this?'</p>

<p>'My apprentice, Oelph.'</p>

<p>'Very good. Follow me.'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked round as we started up some bare wooden
stairs, a conspiratorial look on her face. I was caught in the act
of directing a most harsh stare at the black back of the woman
leading us, but the Doctor just smiled and winked.</p>

<p>The servant who had talked to the Doctor locked the dock door
and disappeared through another which I guessed led to the
servants' floor.</p>

<p>The passage-way was steep and narrow and unlit save for a slit
window every storey, where the wooden steps twisted to double back
on themselves. There was a narrow door at each floor, too. It
crossed my mind that perhaps these confined quarters were for
children, for the Slaver Tunch was well known for specialising in
child slaves.</p>

<p>We came to the second landing. 'How long has Slaver Tunch&mdash;?' the
Doctor began.</p>

<p>'Please do not talk on these stairs,' the strict-looking woman
told her. 'Others may hear.'</p>

<p>The Doctor said nothing, but turned back to look at me again,
her eyes wide and the corners of her mouth turned down.</p>

<p>We were led into the rest of the house at the third storey. The
corridor we found ourselves in was broad and plush. Paintings
adorned the walls, and facing us were wall-high glass windows
letting in the sight of the tops of the grand houses on the far
side of the canal and the sky and clouds beyond. A series of tall,
wide doors opened off the corridor. We were ushered towards the
tallest and widest.</p>

<p>The woman put her hand on the door's handle. 'The servant,' she
said. 'On the dock.'</p>

<p>'Yes?' said the Doctor.</p>

<p>'He talked to you?'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked into the woman's eyes for a moment. 'I asked
him a question,' she said (this is one of the few times I have ever
heard the Doctor directly lie).</p>

<p>'I thought so,' the woman said, opening the door for us.
We stepped into a large, dark room lit only by candies and
lanterns. The floor underfoot felt warm and furry. At first I
thought I'd stepped on a hound. There was a perfume of great
sweetness in the room and I thought I detected the scent of various
herbs known to have a healing or tonic effect. I tried to detect a
smell of sickness or corruption, but could not. A huge canopied bed
sat in the middle of the room. It held a large man attended by
three people: two servants and a well-dressed lady. They looked
round as we entered and light flooded into the room. The light
started to wane behind us as the severe-looking woman closed the
doors from outside.</p>

<p>The Doctor turned round and said through the narrowing gap, 'The
servant&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Will be punished,' the woman said with a wintry smile.</p>

<p>The doors thudded shut. The Doctor breathed deeply and then
turned to the candle-lit scene in the centre of the room.</p>

<p>'You are the woman doctor?' the lady asked, approaching us.</p>

<p>'My name is Vosill,' the Doctor told her. 'Lady Tunch?'</p>

<p>The woman nodded. 'Can you help my husband?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, ma'am.' The Doctor looked round the shadowy,
half-hidden spaces of the room, as if trying to guess its extent.
'It would help if I could see him. Is there a reason for the
curtains being drawn?'</p>

<p>'Oh. We were told the darkness would reduce the swellings.'</p>

<p>'Let's take a look, shall we?' the Doctor said. We crossed to the
bed. Walking on the thick floor covering was an odd, disconcerting
experience, like walking on the deck of a pitching ship.</p>

<p>The Slave Master Tunch had, by repute, always been a huge man.
He was bigger now. He lay on the bed, breathing quickly and
shallowly, his skin grey and blotched. His eyes were closed. 'He
seems to sleep almost all the time,' the lady told us. She was a thin
little thing, scarcely more
than a child, with a pinched, pale face and hands that were forever
kneading each other. One of the two servants was mopping her
husband's brow. The other was fussing at the bottom of the bed,
tucking in bed clothes. 'He was soiled, just earlier,' the lady
explained.</p>

<p>'Did you keep the stool?' the Doctor asked.</p>

<p>'No!' the lady said, shocked. 'We have no need to. The house has
a water closet.'</p>

<p>The Doctor took the place of the servant mopping the man's brow.
She looked into his eyes, she looked in his mouth and then she
pulled back the coverings over the huge bulge of his body before
pulling up his shirt. I think the only fatter people I have seen
have been eunuchs. Master Tunch was not just fat (though goodness
knows, there is nothing wrong with being fat!), he bulged. Oddly. I
saw this myself, even before the Doctor pointed this out.</p>

<p>She turned to the lady. 'I need more light,' she told her.
'Would you have the curtains opened?'</p>

<p>The lady hesitated, then nodded to the servants.</p>

<p>Light washed into the great room. It was even more splendid than
I had imagined. All the furniture was covered in gold leaf. Cloth
of gold hung from the bed's great frame. It was drawn up into a
great sphincter shape in the centre of the ceiling and even formed
the curtains themselves. Paintings and mirrors covered every wall
and pieces of sculpture &mdash; mostly nymphs and a few of the old, wanton
goddesses &mdash; stood on the floor or sat upon the tables, desks and
sideboards, where a veritable profusion of what looked like human
skulls covered in gold leaf were scattered. The carpets were a soft
and lustrous blue-black, and were, I guessed, zuleon fur, from the
far south. They were so thick I wasn't surprised that walking on
them had been unsettling.</p>

<p>Slave Master Tunch looked no better in the light of day than he
had by candle glow. His flesh was everywhere puffy and discoloured
and his body seemed a strange shape, even for one so large. He
moaned and one fat hand came fluttering up like a doughy bird. His
wife took it and held it to her cheek one-handed. There was an
awkwardness about the way she tried to use both hands that
mystified me at the time.</p>

<p>The Doctor pressed and prodded the giant frame in a variety of
places. The man groaned and whimpered but uttered no intelligible
word.</p>

<p>'When did he start to bloat like this?' she asked.</p>

<p>'About a year past, I think,' the lady said. The Doctor looked
at her quizzically. The lady looked bashful. 'We were only married
a half-year ago,' the Slaver's wife said. The Doctor was looking at
her oddly, but then she smiled.</p>


<p>'Was there much pain at the start?'</p>


<p>'The Housemistress has told me that his last wife said it was
about Harvest when he began to get the pains, and then his . . .'
She patted her own waist. 'His girth began to become greater.'</p>

<p>The Doctor kept prodding the great body. 'Did he become ill
tempered?'</p>

<p>The lady smiled a small, hesitant smile. 'Oh, I think he was
always . . . he was never one to suffer fools gladly.' She started
to hug herself, then winced with pain before she could cross her
arms, settling instead for massaging her upper left arm with her
right hand.</p>

<p>'Is your arm sore?' the Doctor asked her.</p>

<p>The lady stepped back, eyes wide. 'No!' she exclaimed, still
clutching her arm. 'No. There's nothing wrong with it. It's
fine.'</p>

<p>The Doctor pulled the man's night dress back down and drew the
covers over him. 'Well, there's nothing I can do for him. Best let
him sleep.'</p>

<p>'Sleep?' the lady wailed. 'All day, like an animal?'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry,' the Doctor said. 'I should have said best let him
remain unconscious.'</p>


<p>'Is there nothing you can do for him?'</p>


<p>'Not really,' the Doctor said. 'The illness is so advanced that
he is hardly even feeling the pain now. It's unlikely he'll come
round again. I can write you a prescription for something to give
him if he does, but I imagine his brother has already dealt with
that.'</p>

<p>The lady nodded. She was staring at the great form that was her
husband, one fist at her mouth, her teeth biting on her knuckle.
'He's going to die!'</p>


<p>'Almost certainly. I'm sorry.'</p>


<p>The lady shook her head. Eventually she tore her gaze away from
the bed. 'Should I have called you earlier? If I had, would that&mdash;
?'</p>

<p>'It would have made no difference,' the Doctor told her. 'There
is nothing any doctor could have done for him. Some diseases are
not treatable.' She looked down &mdash; with a cold expression, it seemed
to me &mdash; at the body lying panting on the great bed. 'Happily some
are also not transmissible.' She looked up at the lady. 'You need
have no fear on that point.' She glanced round at the servants as
she said this.</p>


<p>'How much do I owe you?' the wife asked.</p>


<p>'Whatever you think fit,' the Doctor said. 'I have been able to
do nothing. Perhaps you feel I deserve nothing.'</p>

<p>'No. No, not at all. Please.' The lady went to a bureau near the
bed and took out a small plain purse. She handed it to the
Doctor.</p>

<p>'You really should have that arm seen to,' the Doctor said
softly, while studying the other woman's face, and her mouth, most
closely. 'It might mean&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No,' the lady said quickly, looking away and then walking off
to the nearest of the tall windows. 'I am perfectly well, Doctor.
Perfectly. Thank you for coming. Good day.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We sat in the hired chair on the way back, wobbling and weaving
through the crowds of Land Street, heading for the Palace. I was
folding away my spiced kerchief. The Doctor smiled sadly. She had
been in a thoughtful, even morose mood all the way back (we had
left the same way we had arrived, via the private dock). 'Still
worried about ill humours, Oelph?'</p>

<p>'It is how I was raised, mistress, and it seems like a sensible
precaution.'</p>

<p>She sighed heavily and looked out at the people. 'Ill humours,'
she said, and seemed to be talking more to herself than to me.</p>

<p>'Those ill humours you talked about from insects, mistress . .
.' I began, recalling something that my master had communicated to
me.</p>

<p>'Hmm?'</p>

<p>'Can they be extracted from the insects and used? I mean, might
some assassin, say, be able to have made a concentrate of such
insects and administer the potion to a victim?' I tried to look
innocent.</p>

<p>The Doctor had a look about her I thought I recognised. Usually
it meant that she was about to launch into some extremely long and
involved explanation concerning how some aspect of medicine worked,
and how all the assumptions that I might have held about the
subject were completely wrong. On this occasion, though, she seemed
to fall back from the brink of such a lecture, and looked away and
just said, 'No.'</p>

<p>There was silence between us for a while. During that time I
listened to the braided canes of the chair as they creaked and
cracked around us.</p>

<p>'What was wrong with the lady Tunch's arm, mistress?' I asked
eventually.</p>

<p>The Doctor sighed. 'It had been broken, I think, and then set
badly,' she said.</p>

<p>'But any saw-smith can set a bone, mistress!'</p>

<p>'It was probably a radial fracture. Those are always more
difficult.' She looked out at the milling people all walking,
bargaining, arguing and yelling on the street. 'But yes, a rich
man's wife . . . especially one with a doctor in the family . . .'
She looked round slowly at me. 'You would think such a person would
receive the best of attention, wouldn't you? Instead of, it would
seem, none.'</p>


<p>'But . . .' I began, then started to understand. 'Ah.'</p>

<p>'Ah, indeed,' the Doctor said.</p>


<p>We both watched the people for a while, as our quartet of hired
men carried the chair through them, uphill towards the Palace. The
Doctor sighed after a while and said, 'Her jaw had been broken not
long ago, too. It hadn't been treated, either.' Then she took the
purse mistress Tunch had given her out of her coat and said
something that wasn't really like her at all. 'Look, here's a
drinking house. Let's go for a drink.' She looked at me closely.
'Do you drink, Oelph?'</p>


<p>'I don't, that is, I'm not really, well, I have but not&mdash;'</p>


<p>She held a hand up out of the side of the chair. One of the rear
men shouted to those in front and we drew to an orderly halt right
outside the door of the inn.</p>

<p>'Come on,' she said, slapping me on the knee, 'I'll teach
you.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="chapter">6. THE BODYGUARD</h3>

<p>The concubine lady Perrund, attended at a discreet distance by a
eunuch of the harem guard, took her daily constitutional as usual a
little after breakfast. Her route that day took her to one of the
higher towers on the east wing where she knew she could gain access
to the roof. It was a fine, clear day and the view could be
particularly fine, looking out over the palace grounds to the
spires and domes of the city of Crough, the plains beyond, and the
hills in the deep distance.</p>

<p>'Why, DeWar!'</p>

<p>The chief bodyguard DeWar sat in a large, sheet-covered chair
that was one of twenty or so pieces of furniture which had been
stored in the tower room. His eyes were closed, his chin was
resting on his chest. His head jerked up, he looked around and
blinked. The concubine Perrund sat in a seat beside him, her red
gown bright against the dark blue of the sheet. The white-clad
eunuch guard stood by the door.</p>

<p>DeWar cleared his throat. 'Ah, Perrund,' he said. He drew
himself up in the chair and straightened his black tunic. 'How are
you?'</p>

<p>'Pleased to see you, DeWar, though surprised,' she told him,
smiling. 'You looked as though you were slumbering. I thought of
all people the Protector's chief bodyguard would be the least
likely to need sleep during the day.'</p>

<p>DeWar glanced round at the eunuch guard. 'The Protector has
given me the Xamis-morning off,' he said. 'There's a formal
breakfast for the Xinkspar delegation. There are guards everywhere.
He thinks I am surplus.'</p>

<p>'You think otherwise.'</p>

<p>'He is surrounded by men with weapons. Just because they're our
guards doesn't mean there isn't a threat. Naturally I think I ought
to be there but he will not be told.' DeWar rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>'So you became unconscious out of pique?'</p>

<p>'Did I look asleep?' DeWar asked innocently. 'I was only
thinking.'</p>

<p>'And very fast a-thought you looked. What did you conclude?'</p>

<p>'That I must not answer so many questions.'</p>

<p>'A fine decision. People do pry so.'</p>

<p>'And you?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I rarely think. There are so many people who think &mdash; or
think they think &mdash; better than I. It would be presumptuous.'</p>

<p>'I meant what brings you here? Is this your morning walk?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I like to take the air from the roof.'</p>

<p>'I must remember not to position myself here next time I want to
think.'</p>

<p>'I vary my route, DeWar, There is no certain escape in any
public part of the palace. The only safe place might be within your
own chambers.'</p>

<p>'I shall try to remember.'</p>

<p>'Good. I trust you are happy now?'</p>

<p>'Happy? Why would that be?'</p>

<p>'There has been an attempt on the Protector's life. I understood
you were there.'</p>

<p>'Ah, that.'</p>

<p>'Aye, that.'</p>

<p>'Yes. I was there.'</p>

<p>'So, are you happy now? The last time we talked you expressed
dismay that there had been so few assassins recently, taking this
as incontrovertible proof that we must be entirely surrounded by
them.'</p>

<p>DeWar smiled ruefully. 'Ah yes. Then, no, I am no happier, my
lady.'</p>

<p>'I thought not.' The lady Perrund rose to go. DeWar stood as she
did. 'I understand the Protector visits us in the harem later
today,' she said. 'Will you be joining us then?'</p>

<p>'I imagine so.'</p>

<p>'Good. I'll leave you to your thinking.' The lady Perrund
smiled, then made for the door which led to the roof, followed by
the eunuch guard.</p>

<p>DeWar watched her and the guard go, then stretched and
yawned.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The palace concubine Yalde was a favourite of General YetAmidous
and was often called to his home in the palace grounds. The girl
could not speak, though she appeared to have a tongue and
everything else required for speech, and understood imperial well
enough and the local language of Tassaseni a very little. She had
been a slave. Perhaps there was something that had happened to her
during that time which had addled whatever part of her brains would
normally have granted her the power of speech. Still, she could
whimper and moan and shout when she was being pleasured, as the
General never tired of telling his friends.</p>

<p>Yalde sat on the same vast couch as the General, in the
principal receiving room of his house, feeding him finger fruits
from a crystal bowl while he played with her long black hair,
twisting and untwisting it in one large hand. It was night, a bell
or so after a small banquet YetAmidous had thrown. The men still
wore their dining robes. Present with YetAmidous were RuLeuin,
UrLeyn's brother, BreDelle, the Protector's physician, Guard
Commander ZeSpiole, the Generals Duke Simalg and Duke Ralboute and
a few aides and court juniors.</p>

<p>'No, there are paper screens or something,' said RuLeuin. 'He
must have burst through those.'</p>

<p>'It was the ceiling, I tell you. Think. It would be the best
place. Hint of danger, and &mdash; whumpf! Straight down. Why, you could
just drop a cannon ball on whoever was causing the trouble. Quite
easy, really. A fool could do it.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense. The walls.'</p>

<p>'ZeSpiole should know,' YetAmidous said, interrupting RuLeuin
and Simalg. 'ZeSpiole? What do you have to say?'</p>

<p>'I wasn't there,' ZeSpiole said, waving a goblet around. 'And
the painted chamber was never used while I was chief
bodyguard.'</p>

<p>'Still, you must know of it,' YetAmidous said.</p>

<p>'Of course I know of it,' ZeSpiole said. He stopped waving his
goblet round long enough for a passing servant to fill it with
wine. 'Lots of people <em>know</em> of it, but no one goes in
there.'</p>

<p>'So how did DeWar surprise the Sea Company assassin?' Simalg
asked. Simalg was a Duke with vast lands in the east, but
had been one of the first of the old noble families to declare for
UrLeyn during the war of succession. He was a thin,
ever-languorous-looking man with long straight brown hair. 'The
ceiling, was it not, ZeSpiole? Do tell me I'm right.'</p>

<p>'The walls,' RuLeuin said. 'Through a painting, a portrait in
which the eyes had been cut out!'</p>

<p>'I can't say.'</p>

<p>'But you must!' Simalg protested.</p>

<p>'It's a secret.'</p>

<p>'Is it?'</p>

<p>'It is.'</p>

<p>'There we are,' YetAmidous said to the others. 'It is a
secret.'</p>

<p>'Does the Protector say so, or his smug saviour?' Ralboute
asked. A stout but muscled man, Duke Ralboute had been another
early convert to UrLeyn's cause.</p>

<p>'You mean DeWar?' ZeSpiole asked.</p>

<p>'Does he not seem smug to you?' Ralboute asked, and drank from
his goblet.</p>

<p>'Yes, smug,' Doctor BreDelle said. 'And too clever by half. Or
even more.'</p>

<p>'And hard to pin down,' Ralboute added, pulling his dining robe
more loosely over his huge frame and brushing some crumbs away.</p>

<p>'Try lying on him,' Simalg suggested.</p>

<p>'I'll lie on you,' Ralboute told the other noble.</p>

<p>'I think not.'</p>

<p>'Do you think DeWar would lie with the Protector?' YetAmidous
asked. 'Do we think he really is a lover of men? Or are these only
rumours?'</p>

<p>'You never see him inside the harem,' RuLeuin said.</p>

<p>'Would he be allowed?' BreDelle asked. The court physician was
only allowed to make professional calls to the harem when its own
female nurse could not cope.</p>

<p>'Chief bodyguard?' ZeSpiole said. 'Yes. He could pick amongst
the household concubines. The ones dressed in blue.'</p>

<p>'Ah,' YetAmidous said, and stroked under the chin of the
dark-haired girl at his side. 'The household girls. One level
beneath my little Yalde.'</p>

<p>'I think DeWar does not make use of that particular privilege,'
Ralboute said.</p>

<p>'They say he keeps the company of the concubine Perrund,'
RuLeuin said.</p>

<p>'The one with the wasted arm.' YetAmidous nodded.</p>

<p>'I have heard that too,' BreDelle agreed.</p>

<p>'One of UrLeyn's own?' Simalg looked aghast. 'You don't mean
that he has her? Providence! The Protector would make sure he could
stay in the harem as long as he liked &mdash; as a eunuch.'</p>

<p>'I cannot imagine that DeWar is that foolish or so intemperate,'
BreDelle said. 'It could only be courtly love.'</p>

<p>'Or they could be plotting something, could they not?' Simalg
suggested.</p>

<p>'I hear he visits a house in the city, though not often,'
RuLeuin said.</p>

<p>'A house with girls?' YetAmidous asked. 'Not boys?'</p>

<p>'Girls,' RuLeuin confirmed.</p>

<p>'I think I'd ask for double fare, if I were a girl who had to
accommodate that fellow,' Simalg said. 'He has a sour smell about
him. Have you never noticed?'</p>

<p>'You may have a nose for these things,' said Doctor
BreDelle.</p>

<p>'Perhaps DeWar has a special dispensation from the Protector,'
Ralboute suggested. 'A secret one which lets him bed Perrund.'</p>

<p>'She's crippled!' YetAmidous said.</p>

<p>'Yet still, I think, beautiful,' Simalg said.</p>

<p>'And it must be said that some people have been known to find
infirmity attractive,' Doctor BreDelle added.</p>

<p>'Cleaving the regal lady Perrund. A privilege you enjoyed,
ZeSpiole?' Ralboute asked the older man.</p>

<p>'Sadly not,' ZeSpiole said. 'And I do not think DeWar does
either. I suspect theirs is a meeting of minds, not bodies.'</p>

<p>'Too clever by twice,' Simalg muttered, beckoning more wine.</p>

<p>'What privileges do you most miss from the post DeWar now has?'
Ralboute asked, looking down as he peeled a piece of fruit. He
shooed away a servant who offered to do this for him.</p>

<p>'I miss being near the Protector every day, but little else. It
is an unnerving job. A young man's job. My present post is quite
exciting enough without having to deal with murderous
ambassadors.'</p>

<p>'Oh, come, ZeSpiole,' Ralboute said, sucking at his fruit and
then spitting out a mush of seeds into a waste bowl before sucking
again and swallowing. He wiped his lips. 'You must resent DeWar,
mustn't you? He usurped you.'</p>

<p>ZeSpiole was silent for a moment. 'Usurpation can be the right
course, sometimes, Duke, don't you think?' He looked round the
others. 'We all of us usurped the old King. It needed to be
done.'</p>

<p>'Absolutely,' said YetAmidous.</p>

<p>'Of course,' RuLeuin agreed.</p>

<p>'Mmmm!' BreDelle nodded, mouth full of a sweetmeat.</p>

<p>Ralboute nodded. Simalg gave a sigh. 'Our Protector did the
usurping,' he said. 'The rest of us helped.'</p>

<p>'And proud to do so,' YetAmidous said, slapping the edge of his
couch.</p>

<p>'So you don't resent the fellow at all?' Ralboute asked
ZeSpiole. 'You are a child of Providence indeed.' He shook his head
and used his fingers to break the flesh of another fruit.</p>

<p>'I no more resent him than you ought to resent the Protector,'
ZeSpiole said.</p>

<p>Ralboute was stopped in his eating. 'Why should I resent
UrLeyn?' he asked. 'I honour UrLeyn and what he has done.'</p>

<p>'Including putting us here in the palace,' Simalg said. 'We
might have still been juniors, out of favour. We owe the Grand
Aedile as much as any trader who pins his voting document &mdash; what do
you call it? Franchisement. His Franchisement high on his
wall.'</p>

<p>'Just so,' ZeSpiole said. 'And yet if anything was to happen to
the Protector &mdash;'</p>

<p>'Providence forbid!' YetAmidous said.</p>

<p>'&mdash; might not a Duke such as you &mdash; a person of high birth under
the old regime yet who had also been a faithful general under the
Protector's new order &mdash; be just the sort of person the people might
turn to, as successor?'</p>

<p>'Or there's the boy,' Simalg said, yawning.</p>

<p>'This talk's uncomfortable,' RuLeuin said.</p>

<p>'No,' ZeSpiole said, looking at RuLeuin. 'We must be able to
talk of such things. Those who wish Tassasen and UrLeyn ill most
certainly will not shrink from such talk. You need to think of such
things, RuLeuin. You are the Protector's brother. People might turn
to you if he was taken from us.'</p>

<p>RuLeuin shook his head. 'No,' he said. 'I have risen so
considerably on his cloak-tails. People already think I have
climbed too far.' He glanced over at Ralboute, who looked back with
wide, expressionless eyes.</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' Simalg said, waving a hand, 'we Dukes are frightfully
against such accidents of birth.'</p>

<p>'Where's that housemaster?' YetAmidous said. 'Yalde, be a dear
and go and fetch the musicians back, would you? All this talk is
making my head ache. We need music and songs!'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Here!'</p>

<p>'There! There he is!'</p>

<p>'Quick! Catch him! Catch him! Quickly!'</p>

<p>'Aah!'</p>

<p>'Too late!'</p>

<p>'I win I win I win!'</p>

<p>'You win again! What cunningness in one so young!' Perrund
picked the boy up with her good arm and swung him on to the seat
beside her. Lattens, UrLeyn's son, squirmed as he was tickled then
yelped and dived under a fold in the concubine's gown and tried to
hide there as DeWar, who had run most of the length of the visiting
chamber of the outer harem in a vain attempt to head Lattens off,
arrived panting and growling.</p>

<p>'Where's that child?' he demanded gruffly.</p>

<p>'Child? Why, what child could that be?' the lady Perrund asked,
hand at her throat, her blue-flecked eyes wide.</p>

<p>'Ach, never mind. I'll just have to sit down here to get my
breath back after chasing the young scamp.' There was a giggle as
DeWar sat down right beside the boy, whose hose and shoes stuck out
from the woman's robe. 'What's this? Here are that rascal's shoes.
And look!' DeWar grabbed Lattens' ankle. There was a muffled
shriek. 'And his leg! I'll bet the rest is attached! Yes! Here he
is!' Perrund pulled away the fold of her gown to let DeWar tickle
the boy, then brought a cushion from another part of the couch and
put it under the boy's bottom. DeWar plonked him there. 'Do you
know what happens to boys who win at hide-and-seek?' DeWar asked.
Lattens, wide-eyed, shook his head and made to suck his thumb.
Perrund gently stopped him from doing this. 'They get,' DeWar
growled, coming very close to the child, 'sweets!'</p>

<p>Perrund handed him the box of crystallised fruits. Lattens
squealed with delight and rubbed his hands together, staring into
the box and trying to decide which to have first. Eventually he
grabbed a small handful.</p>

<p>Huesse, another red-gowned concubine, sat heavily down on a
couch across from Perrund and DeWar. She too had been involved in
the game of hide-and-seek. Huesse was Lattens' aunt. Her sister had
died giving birth to Lattens towards the start of the war of
succession. Huesse was a plumply supple woman with unruly fair
ringleted hair.</p>

<p>'And have you had your lessons for today, Lattens?' Perrund
asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' the boy said. He was small made, like his father, though
he had the red-tinged golden hair of his mother and his aunt.</p>

<p>'And what did you learn today?'</p>

<p>'More things about equal triangles, and some history, about
things which have happened.'</p>

<p>'I see,' Perrund said, settling the boy's collar back down and
patting his hair flat again.</p>

<p>'There was this man called Narajist,' the boy said, licking his
fingers free of sugar dust.</p>

<p>'Naharajast,' DeWar said. Perrund motioned him quiet.</p>

<p>'Who looked in a tube at the sky and told the Emperor. . .'
Lattens screwed up his eyes and peered up at the three glowing
plaster domes lighting the chamber. 'Poeslied &mdash;'</p>

<p>'Puiside,' DeWar muttered. Perrund frowned severely and
tutted.</p>

<p>'&mdash; there were big fiery rocks up there and Watch Out!' The boy
stood and shouted the last two words, then sat down again and leant
over the box of sweets, one finger to his lips. 'And the Emperor
didn't and the rocks killed him dead.'</p>

<p>'Well, it's a little simplified,' DeWar began.</p>

<p>'What a sad story!' Perrund said, now ruffling the boy's hair.
'The poor old Emperor!'</p>

<p>'Yes,' the boy shrugged. 'But Daddy came along and made
everything all right again.'</p>

<p>The three adults looked at each other and laughed. 'Indeed he
did,' Perrund said, taking away the box of sweets and hiding it
behind her. 'Tassasen is powerful again, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'Mm-hmm,' Lattens said, trying to squirm behind Perrund in
pursuit of the box of sweets.</p>

<p>'I think it might be time for a story,' Perrund said, and pulled
the boy back to a sitting position. 'DeWar?'</p>

<p>DeWar sat and thought for a moment. 'Well,' he said, 'it's not
much of a story, but it is a story of sorts.'</p>

<p>'Then tell it.'</p>

<p>'It is suitable for the boy?' Huesse asked.</p>

<p>'I shall make it so.' DeWar sat forward and shifted his sword
and dagger. 'Once upon a time there was a magical land where every
man was a king, every woman a queen, each boy a prince and all
girls princesses. In this land there were no hungry people and no
crippled people.'</p>

<p>'Were there any poor people?' asked Lattens.</p>

<p>'That depends what you mean. In a way no, because they could all
have any amount of riches they wanted, but in a way yes, for there
were people who chose to have nothing. Their hearts' desire was to
be free from owning anything, and they usually preferred to stay in
the desert or in the mountains or the forests, living in caves or
trees or just wandering around. Some lived in the great cities,
where they too just roved about. But wherever they chose to wander,
the decision was always theirs.'</p>

<p>'Were they holy people?' Lattens asked.</p>

<p>'Well, in a way, maybe.'</p>

<p>'Were they all handsome and beautiful, too?' Huesse asked.</p>

<p>'Again, that depends what you mean by beautiful,' DeWar said
apologetically. Perrund sighed with exasperation. 'Some people see
a sort of beauty in ugliness,' DeWar said. 'And if everybody is
beautiful there is something singular in being ugly, or just plain.
But, generally, yes, everybody was as beautiful as they wanted to
be.'</p>

<p>'So many ifs and buts,' Perrund said. 'This sounds a very
equivocal land.'</p>

<p>'In a way,' DeWar smiled. Perrund hit him with a cushion.
'Sometimes,' DeWar continued, 'as people in the land brought more
of it under cultivation&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What was the name of the land?' Lattens interrupted.</p>

<p>'Oh . . . Lavishia, of course. Anyway, sometimes the citizens of
Lavishia would discover whole groups of people who lived a bit like
the wanderers, that is, like the poor or holy people in their own
land, but who did not have the choice of living like that. Such
people lived like that because they had to. These were people who
hadn't had the advantages in life the people of Lavishia were used
to. In fact, dealing with such people soon became the biggest
problem the people of Lavishia had.'</p>

<p>'What? They had no war, famine, pestilence, taxes?' Perrund
asked.</p>

<p>'None. And no real likelihood of the last three.'</p>

<p>'I feel my credulity being stretched,' Perrund muttered.</p>

<p>'So in Lavishia everybody was happy?' Huesse asked.</p>

<p>'As happy as they could be,' DeWar said. 'People still managed
to make their own unhappinesses, as people always do.'</p>

<p>Perrund nodded. 'Now it begins to sound plausible.'</p>

<p>'In this land there lived two friends, a boy and a girl who were
cousins and who had grown up together. They thought they were
adults but really they were still just children. They were the best
of friends but they disagreed on many things. One of the most
important things they disagreed about was what to do when Lavishia
chanced upon one of these tribes of poor people. Was it better to
leave them alone or was it better to try and make life better for
them? Even if you decided it was the right thing to do to make life
better for them, which way did you do this? Did you say, Come and
join us and be like us? Did you say, Give up all your own ways of
doing things, the gods that you worship, the beliefs you hold most
dear, the traditions that make you who you are? Or do you say, We
have decided you should stay roughly as you are and we will treat
you like children and give you toys that might make your life
better? Indeed, who even decided what was better?'</p>

<p>Lattens was shifting and wriggling on the couch. Perrund was
trying to keep him still. 'Were there really not any wars?' the
child asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Perrund said, looking concernedly at DeWar. 'This may all
be a little abstract for a child of Lattens' age.'</p>

<p>DeWar smiled sadly. 'Well, there were some very small wars very
far away, but to be brief, the two friends decided that they would
put their arguments to a test. They had another friend, a lady, who
. . . very much liked both of the friends, and who was very clever
and very beautiful and who had a favour which she was prepared to
grant either of them.' DeWar looked at Perrund and Huesse.</p>

<p>'<em>Either</em> of them?' Perrund asked with a small smile.
Huesse looked at the floor.</p>

<p>'She was broad-minded,' DeWar said, and cleared his throat.
'Anyway, it was agreed that the two cousins would present their
arguments to her and whoever lost the argument had to leave and let
the favour be granted to the other one alone.'</p>

<p>'Did this third friend know about the cousins' amusing
agreement?' Perrund inquired.</p>

<p>'Names! What are the names?' Lattens demanded.</p>

<p>'Yes, what are they called?' Huesse said.</p>

<p>'The girl was called Sechroom and the boy's name was Hiliti.
Their beautiful friend was called Leleeril.' DeWar looked at
Perrund. 'And no, she did not know about the agreement.'</p>

<p>'Tut,' Perrund pronounced.</p>

<p>'So, the three met in a hunting lodge in the high, high
mountains-'</p>

<p>'As high as the Breathless Plains?' Lattens asked.</p>

<p>'Not so high, but steeper, with very sharp peaks. Now&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And which cousin believed in what?' Perrund asked.</p>

<p>'Hmm? Oh, Sechroom believed that one should always interfere, or
try to help, while Hiliti thought it best to leave people be,'
DeWar said. 'Anyway, they had good food and fine wine and they
laughed and told each other stories and jokes and the two friends
Sechroom and Hiliti explained their different ideas to Leleeril and
asked which she thought was right. She tried to say that they were
both right in their own ways, and that sometimes one was right and
one wrong and sometimes the other way round . . . but eventually
Sechroom and Hiliti said Leleeril had to choose one or the other,
and she chose Hiliti, and poor Sechroom had to leave the hunting
lodge.'</p>

<p>'What was it Leeril was going to give Hiliti?' Lattens
asked.</p>

<p>'Something sweet,' DeWar said, and, magician-like, produced a
crystallised fruit from his pocket. He presented the sweet to the
delighted boy, who bit happily into it.</p>

<p>'What happened?' Huesse asked.</p>

<p>'Leleeril found out that her favours had been subject to a bet
and she was hurt. She went away for a while&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Did she <em>have</em> to go away?' Perrund asked. 'You know,
the way girls in polite society sometimes have to, while nature
takes its course?'</p>

<p>'No, she just wanted to be somewhere else, away from everybody
she knew.'</p>

<p>'What, without her parents?' Huesse asked sceptically.</p>

<p>'Without anybody. Then Sechroom and Hiliti realised that perhaps
Leleeril had felt more for one of them than they had imagined and
that they had done a bad thing.'</p>

<p>'There are three Emperors now,' Lattens said suddenly, munching
on his sugary fruit. 'I know their names.' Perrund shushed him.</p>

<p>'Leleeril came back,' DeWar told them, 'but she had made new
friends where she had been, and she had changed while she had been
away, and so went away again, to stay. As far as is known she lived
happily ever after. Sechroom became a soldier-missionary in the
Lavishian army, to help fight in the very small, very far-away
wars.'</p>

<p>'A female soldier?' asked Huesse.</p>

<p>'Of a sort,' DeWar said. 'Perhaps more missionary, or even spy,
than soldier.'</p>

<p>Perrund shrugged. 'The balnimes of Quarreck are said all to be
warrior women.'</p>

<p>DeWar sat back, smiling.</p>

<p>'Oh,' Huesse said, looking disappointed. 'Is that all?' she
asked.</p>

<p>'That's all for now.' DeWar shrugged.</p>

<p>'You mean there's more?' Perrund said. 'You'd better tell us.
The suspense might be too much to bear.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps I'll tell you more some other time.'</p>

<p>'What about Hiliti?' Huesse asked. 'What became of him after his
cousin left?'</p>

<p>DeWar just smiled.</p>

<p>'Very well then,' Perrund chided him. 'Be mysterious.'</p>

<p>'Where is Lavishia?' Lattens asked. 'I know geography.'</p>

<p>'Far away,' DeWar told the boy.</p>

<p>'Far away across the sea?'</p>

<p>'Far away, over the sea.'</p>

<p>'Further than Tyrsk?'</p>

<p>'Much further.'</p>

<p>'Further than the Thrown Isles?'</p>

<p>'Oh, a lot further than that.'</p>

<p>'Further than . . . Drizen?'</p>

<p>'Even further than Drezen. In the land of make-believe.'</p>

<p>'And are the mountains sugar hills?' Lattens asked.</p>

<p>'All of them. And the lakes are fruit juice. And all the game
animals grow on trees, ready cooked. And other trees grow their own
tree-houses, and catapults and bows and arrows grow on them like
fruits.'</p>

<p>'And I suppose the rivers run with wine?' Huesse asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, and the houses and the buildings and the bridges are made
of diamond and gold and everything precious.'</p>

<p>'I've got a pet eltar,' Lattens told DeWar. 'It's called Wintle.
Want to see it?'</p>

<p>'Certainly.'</p>

<p>'It's in the garden, in a cage. I'll fetch it. Come on, let's
go,' Lattens said to Huesse, pulling her on to her feet.</p>

<p>'Probably time he had his run round the garden anyway,' Huesse
said. 'I shall be back soon, with the unruly Wintle.'</p>

<p>DeWar and Perrund watched the woman and the child leave the
chamber under the watchful eyes of a white-clad eunuch in the high
pulpit.</p>

<p>'Now then, Mr DeWar,' Perrund said. 'You have delayed long
enough. You must tell me all about this ambassador assassin you
foiled.'</p>

<p>DeWar told her as much as he felt he could about what had
happened. He left out the details of exactly how he had been able
to respond so promptly to the assassin's attack, and Perrund was
too polite to press him further.</p>

<p>'What of the delegation that came with the Sea Company's
ambassador?'</p>

<p>DeWar looked troubled. 'I think they knew nothing of what he
intended. One of them did, maybe. He had charge of the drugs the
assassin had taken, but the rest were ignorant. Naive innocents who
thought this was a great adventure.'</p>

<p>'Were they sorely questioned?' Perrund asked quietly.</p>

<p>DeWar nodded. He looked down at the floor. 'Only their heads are
going back. I'm told at the end they were glad to lose them.'</p>

<p>Perrund put her hand briefly on the man's arm, then drew it away
again, glancing at the eunuch in the pulpit. 'The blame lies with
their masters who sent them to their deaths, not with you. They
would not have suffered less if their plan had succeeded.'</p>

<p>'I know that,' DeWar said, smiling as best he could. 'Perhaps it
might be called professional lack of empathy. My training is to
kill or disable as quickly as possible, not as slowly.'</p>

<p>'So are you really not content?' Perrund asked. 'There has been
an attempt, and a serious one at that. Do you not feel this
disproves your theory that there is someone here at court?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' DeWar said awkwardly.</p>

<p>Perrund smiled. 'You are not really appeased by this at all, are
you?'</p>

<p>'No,' DeWar admitted. He looked away. 'Well, yes; a little, but
more because I think I have decided you are right. I will worry
whatever happens and always put the worst construction on it. I am
unable not to worry. Worrying is my natural state.'</p>

<p>'So you should not worry about worrying so much,' Perrund
suggested, a smile playing about her lips.</p>

<p>'That is more or less it. Otherwise one might never stop.'</p>

<p>'Most pragmatic.' Perrund leant forward and put her chin in her
hand. 'What was the point of your story about Sechroom, Hiliti and
Leleeril?'</p>

<p>DeWar looked awkward. 'I don't really know,' he confessed. 'I
heard the story in another language. It doesn't survive the
translation very well, and . . . there was more than just the
language that needed translation. Some of the ideas and . . . ways
that people do things and behave required alteration to make sense,
too.'</p>

<p>'Well then, you were mostly successful. Did your story really
happen?'</p>

<p>'Yes. It really happened,' DeWar said, then sat back and
laughed, shaking his head. 'No, I'm jesting with you. How could it
happen? Search the latest globes, scour the newest maps, sail to
the ends of the world. You will not find Lavishia, I swear.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' Perrund said, disappointed. 'So you are not from
Lavishia?'</p>

<p>'How can one be from a place that does not exist?'</p>

<p>'But you are from . . . Mottelocci, wasn't it?'</p>

<p>'Mottelocci indeed.' DeWar frowned. 'I don't recall ever telling
you that.'</p>

<p>'There are mountains there, aren't there? It is one of the . . .
what are they called, now? The Half-Hiddens. Yes. The Half-Hidden
Kingdoms. Unreachable half the year. But a small paradise, they
say.'</p>

<p>'Half a paradise. In spring and summer and autumn it is
beautiful. In winter it is terrible.'</p>

<p>'Three seasons from four would be sufficient to please most
people.'</p>

<p>'Not when the fourth season lasts longer than the other three
put together.'</p>

<p>'Did something like your story happen there?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps.'</p>

<p>'Were you one of the people?'</p>

<p>'Maybe.'</p>

<p>'Sometimes,' Perrund said, sitting back with a look of
exasperation on her face, 'I can quite understand why rulers employ
torturers.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I can always understand,' DeWar said softly. 'Just not . .
.' He seemed to catch himself, then sat upright, pulling his tunic
tighter down. He looked up at the vague shadows cast on the softly
glowing bowl of the light dome overhead. 'Perhaps we have time for
a game of something. What do you say?'</p>

<p>Perrund remained looking at him for a moment, then sighed and
also drew herself upright. 'I say we had better play "Monarch's
Dispute". It is the one game you might be suited for. Though there
are also,' she said, waving to a servant at a distant door,
'"Liar's Dice" and "Secret Keep".'</p>

<p>DeWar sat back on the couch, watching Perrund as she watched the
servant approach. 'And "Subterfuge",' she added, 'and "Blaggard's
Boast" and "Whiff of Truth" and "Travesty" and "The Gentleman
Misinformant" and . . .'</p>

<h3 class="chapter">7. THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p>'My master has a plan for your mistress. A little surprise.'</p>

<p>'I'll bet!'</p>

<p>'More like a big one! Eh?'</p>

<p>'So would mine.' </p>

<p>There were
various other comments and whistles from round the table, though
nothing, in retrospect, that seemed much like wit.</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' I asked.</p>

<p>Feulecharo, apprentice to Duke Walen, just winked. He was a
stocky fellow, with wild brown hair that resisted all attempts to
control it save those employing shears. He was polishing a pair of
boots while the rest of us tucked into our evening meal, in a tent
on the Prospect Plain, one day into the 455th Circuition. On this
first rest stop it was traditional for the senior pages and
apprentices to dine together. Feulecharo had been allowed to join
us by his master, but he was being punished for one of his regular
misdemeanours with extra work, hence the boots, and a set of
rustily ancient ceremonial armour he was supposed to polish before
we set off the next day.</p>

<p>'What sort of plan?' I insisted. 'What can the Duke want with
the Doctor?'</p>

<p>'Let's just say he's suspicious,' Feulecharo said, tapping his
nose with a polishing brush.</p>

<p>'Of what?'</p>

<p>'My master is suspicious, too,' Unoure said, breaking a piece of
bread in half and smearing some gravy round his plate.</p>

<p>'How very true,' drawled Epline, page to Guard Commander
Adlain.</p>

<p>'Well, he is,' Unoure insisted sullenly.</p>

<p>'Still testing out his new ideas on you, is he, Unoure?' one of
the other pages called. He turned to the others. 'We saw Unoure in
the baths once&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Aye, it would be the once!'</p>

<p>'What year was that?'</p>

<p>'We did,' continued the page, 'and you should see the lad's
scars! I tell you, Nolieti is a perfect beast to him!'</p>

<p>'He teaches me everything!' Unoure said, standing up, his eyes
bright with tears.</p>

<p>'Shut up, Unoure,' Jollisce said. 'Don't let this rabble bait
you so.' Slight but elegantly fair, and older than most of us,
Jollisce was page to Duke Ormin, who was the Doctor's employer
after the Mifeli trading family and before the King commandeered
her services. Unoure sat down again, muttering under his breath.
'What plans, Feulecharo?' Jollisce asked.</p>

<p>'Never mind,' Feulecharo said. He started whistling and began to
pay uncharacteristically close attention to the boots he was
polishing, and soon started to talk to them, as though trying to
persuade them to clean themselves.</p>

<p>'That boy is intolerable,' Jollisce said, and took up a pitcher
of the watered wine which was the strongest drink we were
allowed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A little after supper, Jollisce and I wandered along one edge of
the camp. Hills stretched ahead of us and on both sides. Behind us,
past the lip of the Prospect Plain, Xamis was still slowly setting
in a fiery riot of colour, somewhere far beyond the near-circle of
Crater Lake, falling over the round edge of sea.</p>

<p>Clouds, caught half in Xamis's dying light and half in the late
morning glare of Seigen, were lit with gold on one side, and red,
ochre, vermilion, orange, scarlet . . . a wide wilderness of
colours. We walked amongst the settling animals as each was
quieted. Some &mdash; the hauls, mostly &mdash; had a bag over their heads. The
better mounts had elegant eye-muffs while the best had their own
travelling stables and lesser beasts merely warranted a blindfold
made of whatever rag came to hand. One by one they folded
themselves to the ground and prepared to sleep. Jollisce and I
walked among them, Jollisce smoking a long pipe. He was my oldest
and best friend, from the time when I had briefly been in the
service of the Duke before being sent to Haspide.</p>

<p>'Probably it's nothing,' he said. 'Feulecharo likes to listen to
himself talk, and he likes to pretend he knows something everybody
else doesn't. I wouldn't worry about it, but if you think you ought
to report it to your mistress, then of course you must do so.'</p>

<p>'Hmm,' I said. I recall (looking back on that earlier self from
this more mature vantage point) that I was not sure what to do.
Duke Walen was a powerful man, and a schemer. He was not the sort
of man somebody like the Doctor could afford to have as an enemy,
and yet I had to think of my own, real Master, as well as my
Mistress. Should I tell neither of them? Or one &mdash; if so, which? Or
both?</p>

<p>'Listen,' Jollisce said, stopping and turning to me (and it
seemed to me he'd waited until there was nobody else around before
he divulged this last piece of intelligence). 'If it's any help, I
have heard that Walen might have sent somebody to Equatorial
Cuskery.'</p>

<p>'Cuskery?'</p>

<p>'Yes, do you know of it?'</p>

<p>'Sort of. It's a port, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'Port, city-state, Sea Company sanctuary, lair of sea monsters
if you believe some people . . . but the point is, it's about the
furthest north people come in any numbers from the Southern lands,
and they supposedly have quite a number of embassies and legations
there.'</p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'Well, apparently one of Duke Walen's men has been sent to
Cuskery to look for somebody from Drezen.'</p>

<p>'From Drezen!' I said, then lowered my voice as Jollisce frowned
and looked about us, over the sleeping bodies of the great animals.
'But . . . why?'</p>

<p>'I can't imagine,' Jollisce said.</p>

<p>'How long does it take to get to Cuskery?'</p>

<p>'It takes nearly a year to get there. The journey is somewhat
quicker coming back, they say.' He shrugged. 'The winds.'</p>

<p>'That's a long way to send somebody,' I said, wondering.</p>

<p>'I know,' Jollisce said. He sucked on his pipe. 'My man assumed
it was some trade thing. You know, people are always expecting to
make their fortunes from spices or potions or new fruits or
something, if they can get stuff past the Sea Companies and avoid
the storms, but, well, my master came by some information that
indicated Walen's fellow was looking for just one person.'</p>

<p>'Oh.'</p>

<p>'Hmm.' Jollisce stood and faced the Xamis-set, his face made
ruddy by the glow of flame-coloured cloud in the west. 'Good
sunset,' he said, drawing deep on his pipe.</p>

<p>'Very,' I agreed, not really looking.</p>

<p>'Best ones were just around the time the Empire fell, of course.
Didn't you think?'</p>

<p>'Hmm? Oh yes, naturally.'</p>

<p>'Providence's recompense for the sky falling in on us,' Jollisce
mused, frowning into the bowl of his pipe.</p>

<p>'Hmm. Yes.' Who to tell? I thought. Who to tell. . .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Master, the Doctor attended the King in his tent each day during
the Circuition from Haspide to Yvenir because our monarch was
afflicted with an aching back.</p>

<p>The Doctor sat on the side of the bed King Quience lay upon. 'If
it's really that sore, sir, you should rest it,' she told him.</p>

<p>'Rest?' the King said, turning over on to his front. 'How can I
rest? This is the Circuition, you idiot. If I rest so does
everybody else, and then by the time we get to the Summer Palace
it'll be time to come back again.'</p>

<p>'Well,' the Doctor said, pulling the King's shift up out of his
riding breeches to expose his broad, muscled back. 'You might lie
on your back in a carriage, sir.'</p>

<p>'That would hurt too,' he said into his pillow.</p>

<p>'It might hurt a little, sir, but it would quickly become
better. Sitting on a mount will only make it worse.'</p>

<p>'Those carts, they sway all over the place and the wheels bang
down into holes and ruts. These roads are much worse than they were
last year, I'm sure. Wiester?'</p>

<p>'Sir?' the fat chamberlain said, quickly stepping out of the
shadows to the King's side.</p>

<p>'Have somebody find out whose responsibility this bit of road
is. Are the appropriate taxes being collected? If they are, are
they being spent on it and if not where are they going?'</p>

<p>'At once, sir.' Wiester bustled off, leaving the tent.</p>

<p>'You can't trust Dukes to levy taxes properly, Vosill,' the King
sighed. 'At any rate, you can't trust their tax collectors. They
have too damn much authority. Far too many tax collectors have
bought themselves baronies for my liking.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, Sir,' the Doctor said.</p>

<p>'Yes. I've been thinking I might set up some sort of more . . .
town- or city-sized, umm . . .'</p>

<p>'Authority, Sir?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Yes, authority. A council of responsible citizens. Perhaps
just to oversee the roads and city walls and so on, at first.
Things they might care about more than Dukes, who only bother about
their own houses and how much game is in their parks.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure that's a very good idea, sir.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I'm sure it is too.' The King looked round at the Doctor.
'You have them, don't you?'</p>

<p>'Councils, Sir?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I'm sure you've mentioned them. Probably comparing our own
backward arrangements unfavourably, I don't doubt.'</p>

<p>'Would I do that, sir?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I think you would, Vosill.'</p>

<p>'Our arrangements do seem to produce comfortable roads, I would
certainly claim that.'</p>

<p>'But then,' the King said glumly, 'if I take power from the
barons, they'll get upset.'</p>

<p>'Well, make them all arch-Dukes, sir, or give them some other
awards.'</p>

<p>The King thought about this. 'What other awards?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, sir. You might invent some.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I might,' the King said. 'But then, if I go giving power
to the peasants or the tradespeople and so on, they'll only want
more.'</p>

<p>The Doctor continued to massage the King's back. 'We do say that
prevention is better than cure, sir,' she told him. 'The time to
look after the body is before there is anything wrong with it. The
time to rest is before you feel too tired to do anything else, and
the time to eat is before hunger consumes you.</p>

<p>The King frowned as the Doctor's hands moved over his body. 'How
I wish it was all so easy.' he said with a sigh. 'I think the body
must be a simple thing in comparison to a state if it can be
maintained on the basis of such platitudes.'</p>

<p>The Doctor, I thought, looked a little hurt by this. 'Then I am
glad that my concern is for the health of your body, sir, not that
of your country.'</p>

<p>'I <em>am</em> my country,' the King said sternly, though with an
expression which belied his tone.</p>

<p>'Then be glad, sir, that your kingdom is in a better state than
its king, who will not lie in a carriage like a sensible monarch
would.'</p>

<p>'Don't treat me like a child, Vosill!' the King said loudly,
twisting round towards her. 'Ow!' he said, grimacing, and collapsed
back again. 'What you don't realise, Vosill,' he said, through
gritted teeth, 'being a woman, I suppose, is that in a carriage you
have less room for manoeuvre. They take up the whole road, you see?
A man on a mount, why, he can negotiate his way around all the
irregularities on the road surface.'</p>

<p>'I see, sir. Nevertheless, it is a fact that you are spending
the whole day in the saddle, bouncing up and down and compressing
the small pads between your vertebrae and forcing them into the
nerve. That's what is making your spine hurt. Lying in a carriage,
almost no matter how much it shakes and bounces, will certainly be
better for you.'</p>

<p>'Look, Vosill,' the King said in an exasperated tone, levering
himself up on one elbow and looking round at the Doctor. 'How do
you think it would look if the King took to a pleasuring couch and
laid amongst the perfumed pillows of a ladies' carriage like some
porcelain-arsed concubine? What sort of monarch could do that? Eh?
Don't be ridiculous.' He laid carefully back on his front
again.</p>

<p>'I take it your father never did such a thing, sir.'</p>

<p>'No, he . . .' the King began, then looked suspiciously back at
the Doctor before continuing. 'No, he didn't. Of course not. He
rode. And I will ride. I shall ride and make my back sore because
that's what's expected of me. You shall make my back better because
that's what's expected of you. Now, do your job, Doctor, and stop
this damned prattling. Providence preserve me from the wittering of
women! Aow! Will you be careful!'</p>

<p>'I have to find out where it hurts, sir.'</p>

<p>'Well, you've found it! Now do what you're supposed to do, which
is make it <em>stop</em> hurting. Wiester? Wiester!'</p>

<p>Another servant came forward. 'He's just stepped out, sir.'</p>

<p>'Music,' the King said. 'I want music. Fetch the musicians.'</p>

<p>'Sir.' The servant turned to go.</p>

<p>The King snapped his fingers, bringing the servant back.</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>'And wine.'</p>

<p>'Sir.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'What a beautiful sunset, don't you think, Oelph?'</p>

<p>'Yes, mistress. Providence's recompense for the sky falling in
upon us,' I said, recalling Jollisce's phrase (I was sure it was
one he'd heard from somebody else anyway).</p>

<p>'I suppose it's something,' the Doctor agreed.</p>

<p>We were sitting on the broad front bench of the covered wagon
which had become our home. I had been counting. I had slept in the
carriage for eleven of the last sixteen days (the other five I had been
billeted with the other senior pages
and apprentices in buildings in one of the towns we had camped
within) and I would probably sleep in it again for another seven
days out of the next ten, until we reached the city of
Lep-Skatacheis, where we would stop for half a moon. Thereafter the
wagon would be my home for eighteen days out of twenty-one until we
reached Yvenage. Perhaps nineteen out of twenty-two if we
encountered difficulties on the hill roads and were delayed.</p>

<p>The Doctor looked away from the sunset, gazing up the road,
which was lined with tall trees standing in sandy earth on both
sides. An orange-brown haze hung in the air above the swaying tops
of the grander carriages ahead. 'Are we nearly there yet?'</p>

<p>'Very nearly, mistress. This is the longest day's travel on
either leg. The scouts should be in sight of the camp ground and
the forward party ought to have the tents erected and the field
kitchens set up. It is a long draw, but they say the way to look at
it is as saving a day.'</p>

<p>Ahead of us on the road were the grand carriages and covered
wagons of the royal household. Immediately in front of us were two
hauls, their broad shoulders and rumps swaying from side to side.
The Doctor had refused a driver. She wanted to take the whip
herself (though she used it little). This meant that we had to feed
and care for the beasts ourselves each evening. I did not
appreciate this, though my fellow pages and apprentices certainly
did. So far the Doctor had taken on a much higher proportion of
this menial work than I'd expected, but I resented doing any of it
at all, and found it hard to believe that she could not see she was
exposing both of us to ridicule by taking on such a degrading
task.</p>

<p>She was looking at the sunset again. The light caught the edge
of her cheek, outlining it in a colour like that of red gold. Her
hair, falling loose across her shoulders, was glossily radiant with
highlights like spun ruby.</p>

<p>'Were you still in Drezen when the rocks fell from the sky,
mistress?'</p>

<p>'Hmm? Oh. Yes. I didn't leave until about two years later.' She
seemed lost in thought, and her expression suddenly melancholy.</p>

<p>'Did you come by way of Cuskery, by any chance, mistress?'</p>

<p>'Why, Yes, Oelph, I did,' the Doctor said, her expression
lightening as she turned to me. 'You've heard of it?'</p>

<p>'Vaguely,' I said. My mouth had gone quite dry while I wondered
whether to say anything about what I had heard from Walen's page
and Jollisce. 'Umm, is it far from there to here?'</p>

<p>'The voyage is a good half a year,' the Doctor said, nodding.
She smiled up at the sky. 'A very hot place, lush and steamy and
full of ruined temples and various odd animals that have the run of
the place because they are held to be sacred by some ancient sect
or another. The air is saturated with the smell of spices, and when
I was there there was a full night, when Xamis and Seigen had both
long set, almost together, and Gidulph, Jairly and Foy were in the
day sky, and Iparine was eclipsed by the world itself and for a
bell or so there was only the starlight to shine on the sea and the
city, and the animals all howled into the darkness and the waves I
could hear from my room sounded very loud, though it was not really
dark, just silver. People stood in the streets, very quiet, looking
at the stars, as though relieved to find their existence was not a
myth. I wasn't in the street just then, I was .. . I'd met a
terribly nice Sea Company captain that day. Very handsome,' she
said, and sighed.</p>

<p>In that instant she was like a young girl (and I a jealous
youth).</p>

<p>'Did your ship go straight from there to here?'</p>

<p>'Oh no, there were four voyages after Cuskery: to Alyle on the
Sea Company barquentine <em>Face of Jairly</em>,' she said, and
smiled broadly, staring ahead. 'Then from there to Fuollah on a
trireme, of all things . . . a Farossi vessel, ex-Imperial navy,
then overland to Osk, and from there to Illerne by an argosy out of
Xinkspar, finally to Haspide on a galliot of the Mifeli clan
traders.'</p>

<p>'It all sounds most romantic, mistress.'</p>

<p>She gave what looked like a sad smile. 'It was not without its
privations and indignities on occasion,' she said, tapping at the
top of her hoot, 'and once or twice this old dagger was drawn, but
yes, looking back, it was. Very romantic.' She took a deep breath
and let it out, then swivelled and looked up into the skies,
shading her eyes from Seigen.</p>

<p>'Jairly has not yet risen, mistress,' I said quietly, and was
surprised at the coldness I felt. She looked at me oddly.</p>

<p>Some sense returned to me. No matter that since my fever in the
palace, when she had said that we ought to be friends, she was
still my mistress and I was still her servant as well as her
apprentice. And as well as a mistress, I had a Master. Probably
nothing I could find out from the Doctor would be new to him, for
he had many sources, but I could not be sure, and so I supposed I
had an obligation to him to find out all I could from her, in case
some small piece of it might prove useful.</p>

<p>'Was that &mdash; I mean taking the Mifeli clan ship from Illerne to
Haspide &mdash; how you came to be employed by the Mifelis?'</p>

<p>'No, that was just coincidence. I helped around the seamen's
infirmary for a while after I first landed before one of the
younger Mifelis needed treatment on a homebound ship &mdash; it had
signalled ahead to the Sentry Isles. The Mifelis' own doctor then
suffered terribly from seasickness and would not go out on the
cutter to meet the galleon. I was recommended to Prelis Mifeli by
the infirmary's head surgeon, so I went instead. The boy lived, the
ship came in and I was made the Mifeli head-family doctor right
there on the docks. Old man Mifeli doesn't waste time making
decisions.'</p>

<p>'And their old doctor?'</p>

<p>'Pensioned off.' She shrugged.</p>

<p>I watched the rear end of the two hauls for a while. One of them
shat copiously. The steaming shit disappeared under our wagon, but
not before wreathing us in its vapours.</p>

<p>'Dear me, what an awful smell,' the Doctor said. I bit my
tongue. This was one of the reasons that people who were in a
position to do so usually kept as much distance between themselves
and beasts of burden as they could.</p>

<p>'Mistress, may I ask you a question?'</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment. 'You have been asking me various
questions already, Oelph,' she said, and graced me with a sly,
amused look. 'I take it you mean may you ask me a question that may
be impertinent?'</p>

<p>'Umm . . .'</p>

<p>'Ask away, young Oelph. I can always pretend I didn't hear
you.'</p>

<p>'I was just wondering, mistress,' I said, feeling most awkward,
and very warm all of a sudden, 'why you left Drezen?'</p>

<p>'Ah,' she said, and taking up the whip waggled it over the yokes
of the two hauls, barely tickling their necks with the end of it.
She looked briefly at me. 'Partly the urge to have an adventure,
Oelph. just the desire to go somewhere nobody I knew had been
before. And partly . . . partly to get away, to forget somebody.'
She smiled brightly, dazzlingly at me for a moment before looking
away up the road again. 'I had an unhappy love affair, Oelph. And I
am stubborn. And proud. Having made up my mind to leave and having
announced that I would travel to the other ends of the world, I
could not &mdash; I would not &mdash; back down. And so I hurt myself twice,
once by falling for the wrong person, and then a second time by
being too obstinate &mdash; even in a more temperate mood &mdash; to retreat
from a commitment made in a fury of injured pride.'</p>

<p>'Was this the person who gave you the dagger, mistress?' I
asked, already hating and envying the man.</p>

<p>'No,' she said, with a sort of snorting laugh which I thought
was most unladylike. 'I had been wounded by him quite enough
without carrying such a token of his.' She gazed down at the
dagger, sheathed as usual in the top of her right boot. 'The dagger
was a gift from . . . the state. Some of the decoration on the
dagger was given to me by another friend. One I used to have
terrible arguments with. A double-edged gift.'</p>

<p>'What was it you argued about, mistress?'</p>

<p>'Lots of things, or lots of aspects of the same thing. Whether
the might beyond might had a right to impose its values on others.'
She looked at my puzzled expression and laughed. 'We argued about
here, for one thing.'</p>

<p>'Here, mistress?' I asked, looking around.</p>

<p>'About&mdash;' She seemed to catch herself, then said, 'About Haspide,
the Empire. About this whole other hemisphere.' She shrugged. 'I
won't bore you with the details. In the end I left and he stayed,
though I did hear later that he too sailed away, some time after I
did.'</p>

<p>'Do you regret coming here now, mistress?'</p>

<p>'No,' she said, smiling. 'For most of the voyage to Cuskery I
did . . . but the equator signalled a change, as they say it often
does, and since then, no. I still miss my family and friends, but I
am not sorry now that I made the decision.'</p>

<p>'Do you think you will ever go back, mistress?'</p>

<p>'I have no idea, Oelph.' Her expression was troubled and hopeful
at once. Then she produced another smile for me. 'I am the doctor
to the King, after all. I would consider that I have not done my
job properly if he would <em>let</em> me leave. I may be forced to look
after him until he's an old man, or until he grows displeased with
me because I grow whiskers on my lips and my hair thins on my head
and my breath smells, and he has my head chopped off because I
interrupt him once too often. Then you might have to become his
doctor.'</p>

<p>'Oh, mistress,' was all I could say.</p>

<p>'I don't know, Oelph,' she confided in me. 'I'm not so sure
about making plans. I'll wait and see which way fate takes me. If
Providence, or whatever we wish to call it, has me stay, then I'll
stay. If it somehow calls me back to Drezen, I'll go.' She dipped
her head towards me and with what she probably thought was a
conspiratorial look said, 'Who knows, my destiny might lead me back
through Equatorial Cuskery. I might get to see my handsome Sea
Company captain again.' She winked at me.</p>

<p>'Was the land of Drezen much affected by the rocks from the sky,
mistress?' I asked.</p>

<p>She did not seem to heed my tone, which I had worried might seem
excessively frosty. 'More than here in Haspidus,' she said. 'But
much less than the Inlands of the Empire. One city on a far
northern island was washed almost entirely away by a wave, killing
ten or more thousand people, and some ships were lost, and of
course the crop yields all over were down for a couple of growing
seasons; so the farmers moaned, but then the farmers always do. No,
we escaped relatively lightly.'</p>

<p>'Do you think it was the work of the gods, mistress? There are
those who say that Providence was punishing us for something, or
perhaps just punishing the Empire. Others hold that it was the work
of the old gods, and that they are coming back. What do you
think?'</p>

<p>'I think it could be any of those things, Oelph,' the Doctor
said thoughtfully. 'Though there are some people in Drezen
 &mdash; philosophers &mdash; who have a much more bleak explanation, mind
you.'</p>

<p>'Which is what, mistress?'</p>

<p>'That such things happen for no reason at all.'</p>

<p>'No reason?'</p>

<p>'No reason beyond the workings of pure chance.'</p>

<p>I thought about this. 'Do they not think that there is good and
bad? And that one deserves to be emulated and the other not, but
rather punished?'</p>

<p>'A very small number would say that there are no such entities.
Most agree there are, but that they only exist in our minds. The
world itself, without us, does not recognise such things, just
because they are not things, they are ideas, and the world
contained no ideas until people came along.'</p>

<p>'So they believe that Man was not created with the world?'</p>

<p>'That's right. Or at least not people with wits.'</p>

<p>'Are they then Seigenists? Do they believe that the Lesser Sun
created us?'</p>

<p>'Some would say it did. They would claim that people were once
no more than animals and that we too used to fall asleep promptly
when Xamis set, and rise when it rose. Some believe that all we are
is light, that the light of Xamis holds the world together like an
idea, like a hugely complicated dream, and the light of Seigen is
the very expression of us as thinking beings.'</p>

<p>I tried to comprehend this curious concept, and was just
starting to decide that it was not so different from normal beliefs
when the Doctor asked suddenly, 'What do you believe in,
Oelph?'</p>

<p>Her face, turned to me, was the colour of the soft, tawny dusk.
Seigen-light caught fallen wisps of her half-curled red hair.</p>

<p>'What? Why, what all other civil people believe, mistress,' I
said, before thinking that perhaps she, coming from Drezen where
they obviously had some odd ideas, might believe something quite
different. 'That is to say, what people hereabouts, that is in
Haspidus . . .'</p>

<p>'Yes, but what do you personally believe?'</p>

<p>I frowned at her, an expression such a graceful, gentle face did
not deserve to have directed at it. Did the Doctor really imagine
that everybody went around believing different things? One believed
what one was told to believe, what it made sense to believe. Unless one was a foreigner, of
course, or a philosopher. 'I believe in Providence, mistress.'</p>

<p>'But when you say Providence, do you really mean god?'</p>

<p>'No, mistress. I don't believe in any of the old gods. No one
does any more. No one of sense, at any rate. Providence is the rule
of laws, mistress,' I said.</p>

<p>I was trying not to insult her by sounding as though I was
talking to a child. I had experienced aspects of the Doctor's
na&iuml;vet&eacute; before, and ascribed it to simple ignorance of
the manner in which matters were organised in what was to her a
foreign land, but even after the best part of a year it appeared
there were still subjects that each of us assumed we viewed in a
mutual light and from a similar perspective which in fact we saw
quite differently. 'The laws of Nature determine the ordering of
the physical world and the laws of Man determine the ordering of
society, mistress.'</p>

<p>'Hmm,' she said, with an expression that might have been simply
thoughtful or tinged with scepticism.</p>

<p>'One set of laws grows out of the other as do plants from the
common clay,' I added, remembering something I'd been taught in
Natural Philosophy (my determined and strenuous endeavours to take
in absolutely nothing of what I had regarded as entirely the most
irrelevant part of my schooling had patently not met with total
success).</p>

<p>'Which is not so dissimilar to the light of Xamis ordering the
major part of the world, and that of Seigen illuminating the
human,' she mused, staring towards the sunset again.</p>

<p>'I suppose not, mistress,' I agreed, struggling to follow.</p>

<p>'Ha,' she said. 'All very interesting.'</p>

<p>'Yes, mistress,' I said, dutifully.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adlain: Duke Walen. A pleasure, as ever. Welcome to my humble
tent. Please.</p>

<p>Walen: Adlain.</p>

<p>A: Some wine? What about food? Have you eaten?</p>

<p>W: A glass, thank you.</p>

<p>A: Wine. I'll take some too. Thank you, Epline. So, you are
well?</p>

<p>W: Well enough. You?</p>

<p>A: Fine.</p>

<p>W: I wonder, could you . . . ?</p>

<p>A: What, Epline? Yes, of course. Epline, would you . . . ? I'll
call . . . Now then, Walen?... There is nobody else here.</p>

<p>W: Hmm. Very well. This doctor. Vosill.</p>

<p>A: Still her, eh, dear Duke? This is becoming an obsession. Do
you really find her that interesting? Perhaps you ought to tell
her. She may prefer older men.</p>

<p>W: Mocking the wisdom that comes with age is a fit sport only
for those who expect never to attain much of it themselves, Adlain.
You know the substance of my complaint.</p>

<p>A: I regret I don't, Duke.</p>

<p>W: But you have told me of your own doubts. Did you not have her
writing checked in case it was a code or something similar?</p>

<p>A: I thought about it. I decided not to, directly.</p>

<p>W: Well, perhaps you should, directly. She is a witch. Or a spy.
One of the two.</p>

<p>A: I see. And what strange old gods or other demons do you think
she serves? Or which master?</p>

<p>W: I do not know. We will not know, unless we put her to the
question.</p>

<p>A: Ah-ha. Would you like to see that happen?</p>

<p>W: I know it is unlikely while she retains the King's favour,
though that might not last for ever. In any event, there are ways.
She might simply disappear and be questioned ... informally, as it
were.</p>

<p>A: Nolieti?</p>

<p>W: I have . . . not discussed this with him as such, but I have
already ascertained most reliably that he would be more than happy
to oblige. He suspects strongly that she released through death one
of those he was questioning.</p>

<p>A: Yes, he mentioned that to me.</p>

<p>W: Did you think to do anything?</p>

<p>A: I told him he should be more careful.</p>

<p>W: Hmm. At any rate, she might be discovered in such a manner,
though that would be somewhat risky, and she would have to be
killed thereafter anyway. Working to force her from the King's
favour might take longer and could, pressing the matter as one may
have to, entail risks which were hardly less than those attached to
the former course of action.</p>

<p>A: Obviously you have given the matter considerable thought.</p>

<p>W: Of course. But if she was to be taken, without the King's
knowledge, the help of the guard commander might be crucial.</p>

<p>A: It might, mightn't it?</p>

<p>W: So? Would you help?</p>

<p>A: In what way?</p>

<p>W: Provide the men, perhaps?</p>

<p>A: I think not. We might have one lot of the palace guard
fighting their fellows, and that would never do.</p>

<p>W: Well then, otherwise?</p>

<p>A: Otherwise?</p>

<p>W: Damn it, man! You know what I must mean!</p>

<p>A: Blind eyes? Gaps in rosters? That sort of thing?</p>

<p>W: Yes, that.</p>

<p>A: Sins of omission rather than commission.</p>

<p>W: Expressed however you wish. It is the acts, or lack of them I
would know about.</p>

<p>A: Then, perhaps.</p>

<p>W: No more? Merely, 'perhaps'?</p>

<p>A: Were you thinking of doing this in close proximity to the
present, dear Duke?</p>

<p>W: Perhaps.</p>

<p>A: Ha. Now, you see, unless you&mdash;</p>

<p>W: I don't mean today, or tomorrow. I am looking for an
understanding that should it become necessary, such a plan might be
put into effect with as little delay as possible.</p>

<p>A: Then, if I was convinced of the urgency of the cause, it
might.</p>

<p>W: Good. That is better. At last. Providence, you are the
most&mdash;</p>

<p>A: But I would have to believe that the safety of the monarch
was threatened. Doctor Vosill is a personal appointee of the King.
To move against her might be seen as moving against our beloved
Quience himself. His health is in her hands, perhaps as much as it
is in mine. I do my modest best to keep at bay assassins and others
who might wish the King ill, while she combats the illnesses that
come from within.</p>

<p>W: Yes, yes, I know. She is close. He depends on her. It is
already too late to act before her influence achieves its zenith.
We might only work to hasten the descent. But by then it might be
too late.</p>

<p>A: You think that she means to kill the King? Or influence him?
Or does she merely spy, reporting to another power?</p>

<p>W: Her brief might include all of those, depending.</p>

<p>A: Or none.</p>

<p>W: You seem less concerned in this than I imagined, Adlain. She
has come from the ends of the world, entered the city barely two
years ago, doctored to one merchant and one noble &mdash; both briefly &mdash;
and then suddenly she's closer to our King than anybody else!
Providence, a wife would spend less time with him!</p>

<p>A: Yes. One might wonder whether she performs any of the more
intimate duties of a wife.</p>

<p>W: Hmm. I think not. To bed one's physician is unusual, but that
only arises from the unnaturalness of having a woman claiming to be
a doctor in the first place. But, no, I have seen no sign. Why, do
you know?</p>

<p>A: I merely wondered if you knew.</p>

<p>W: Hmm.</p>

<p>A: Of course, she does seem to be a rather good doctor. At the
very least she has done the King no obvious harm, and that in my
experience is far more than one might reasonably expect from a
court physician. Perhaps we should leave her alone for now, while
we have nothing more definite than your suspicions, however
reliable they have proved in the past.</p>

<p>W: We might. Will you have her watched?</p>

<p>A: Well, no more than at present.</p>

<p>W: Hmm. And besides, I have another investment in the truth or
otherwise of her story that may yet yield her.</p>

<p>A: You do? How so?</p>

<p>W: I shall not trouble you with the details, but I have my
doubts concerning certain of her claims and hope presently to bring
before the King one who can discredit her and show her to have
borne false witness to him. It is a long-term investment but it
should bear interest during our time at the Summer Palace or, if
not, then shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>A: I see. Well, we must hope that you do not lose your capital.
Can you tell me what form it takes?</p>

<p>W: Oh, it is the coin of man. And land, and tongue. But I must
hold mine. I'll say no more.</p>

<p>A: I think I shall have more wine. Will you join me?</p>

<p>W: Thank you, no. I have other matters to attend to.</p>

<p>A: Allow me . . .</p>

<p>W: Thank you. Ah. My old bones . . . at least I am able to ride,
though next year I may take carriage. I thank Providence the way
back is easier. And that we are not far from Lep now.</p>

<p>A: I'm sure in the hunt you can out-jump men half your age,
Duke.</p>

<p>W: I am sure I cannot, but your flattery is still gratifying.
Good day.</p>

<p>A: Good day, Duke . . . Epline!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All this I copied &mdash; with a few deletions to make the narrative
less tedious &mdash; from the part of the Doctor's journal written in
Imperial. I never did show it to my Master.</p>

<p>Could she have overheard all this? It seems inconceivable. The
guard commander Adlain had his own physician and I'm sure he never
once called upon the Doctor's services. What would she have been
doing anywhere near his tent?</p>

<p>Could they have been lovers and she was hiding under some bed
covers all the time? That seems no more likely. I was with her
almost all of the time, every single day. Also, she confided in me,
sincerely, I am convinced. She simply did not like Adlain. Indeed
she felt threatened by him. How could she suddenly have tumbled
into bed with a man she feared, never giving the remotest sign
before that she desired to, or afterwards that she had? I know that
illicit lovers can be ingenious in the extreme and suddenly find
within themselves reserves of guile and the ability to act that
even they did not until then know they possessed, but to imagine
the Doctor and the guard commander in such a sexual conspiracy is
surely to draw the bow one notch too far.</p>

<p>Was Epline the source? Did she have some sort of hold over him?
I do not know. They seemed not really to know each other, but who
can tell? They may have been lovers, but the same unlikeliness
attaches to that liaison as does to that of her and Adlain.</p>

<p>I cannot think who else could have heard all of this. It did
occur to me that she might have made it all up, that what she wrote
here constituted her darkest imaginings regarding what others in
the Court might be planning for her, yet somehow that too does not
feel right either. In the end I am left with something that I am
certain reflects a genuine conversation, but with no clear idea how
the Doctor came by it.</p>

<p>But there we are. Some things never do make perfect sense. There
must be some explanation, and it is perhaps a little like the
Doctrine of the Perfect Partner. We must be content to know that
she exists, somewhere in the world, and try not to care overmuch
that we will probably never meet her.</p>

<p class="chapter"><em>*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>*</em></p>


<p>We arrived without incident at the city of Lep-Skatacheis. On
the morning after we arrived the Doctor and I went to the King's
chambers before the business of the day was due to start. As usual
on such occasions, the King's business &mdash; and much of the Court's &mdash;
comprised of hearing certain legal disputes which had been deemed
too complicated or too important for the city authorities and the
Marshal to decide upon. According to my experience, gained during
the three previous years I had travelled this way, such sitting in
judgment was not a function of his responsibilities the King
relished.</p>

<p>The King's chambers were on a corner of the City-Marshal's
palace, overlooking the reflecting terraces of the pools which led
down towards the distant river. Swifts and darts played in the warm
air outside, wheeling and tumbling beyond the cool stone of the
balcony balustrades. The chamberlain Wiester let us in, fussing as
usual.</p>

<p>'Oh. Are you on time? Was there the bell? Or a cannon? I did not
hear the bell. Did you?'</p>

<p>'A few moments ago,' the Doctor told him, following him across
the reception room to the King's dressing chamber.</p>

<p>'Providence!' he said, and opened the doors.</p>

<p>'Ah, the good Doctor Vosill!' the King exclaimed. He was
standing on a small stool in the centre of the great dressing
chamber, being dressed in his ceremonial judicial robes by four
servants. One wall of plaster windows, south facing, flooded the
room with soft, creamy light. Duke Ormin stood nearby, tall and
slightly stooped and dressed in judicial robes. 'How are you
today?' the King asked.</p>

<p>'I am well, your majesty.'</p>

<p>'A very good morning to you, Doctor Vosill,' Duke Ormin said,
smiling. Duke Ormin was ten or so years older than the King. He was
a lanky-legged sort of a fellow with a very broad head and a
surprisingly large torso which always looked, to me at least,
stuffed, as though he had a couple of pillows forced up his shirt.
An odd-looking fellow, then, but most civil and kind, as I knew
myself, having been briefly in his employ, though at a fairly
menial level. The Doctor, too, had been retained by him, more
recently, when she had been his personal physician before she had
become the King's.</p>


<p>'Duke Ormin,' the Doctor said, bowing.</p>


<p>'Ah!' the King said. 'And I was favoured with a "your majesty"!
Usually I am lucky to escape with a "sir".'</p>

<p>'I beg the King's pardon,' the Doctor said, bowing now to
him.</p>

<p>'Granted,' Quience said, putting back his head and letting a
couple of servants gather his blond curls together and pin a skull
cap in place. 'I am obviously in a magnanimous mood this morning.
Wiester?'</p>

<p>'Sire?'</p>

<p>'Inform the good lord judges I shall be joining that I am in
such a good mood they will have to be certain to be at their most
sourly pitiless in court this morning to provide a balance for my
irrepressible leniency. Take heed, Ormin.'</p>

<p>Duke Ormin beamed, his eyes almost disappearing as his face
screwed up in a grin.</p>

<p>Wiester hesitated, then started to make for the door. 'At once,
sire.'</p>


<p>'Wiester.'</p>

<p>'Sire?'</p>

<p>'I was joking.'</p>

<p>'Ah. Ha ha.' The chamberlain laughed.</p>


<p>The Doctor put her bag down on a seat near the door.</p>


<p>'Yes, Doctor?' the King asked.</p>


<p>The Doctor blinked. 'You asked me to attend you this morning,
sir.'</p>


<p>'Did I?' The King looked mystified.</p>

<p>'Yes, last night.' (This was true.)</p>


<p>'Oh, so I did.' The King looked surprised as his arms were
raised and a sleeveless black robe edged in some shiningly white
fur was placed over his shoulders and fastened. He flexed, shifting
his weight from stockinged foot to stockinged foot, clenching his
fists, executing a sort of rolling motion with his shoulders and
his head and then declaring, 'You see, Ormin? I am becoming quite
forgetful in my old age.'</p>

<p>'Why now, sir, you have barely left your youth,' the Duke told
him. 'If you go calling yourself old as though by royal decree,
what must we think who are significantly older than you and yet who
still fondly harbour the belief that we are not yet old? Have
mercy, please.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' the King agreed, with a roll of the hand. 'I
declare myself young again. And well,' he added, with a renewed
look of surprise as he glanced at the Doctor and me. 'Why, I seem
to be quite bereft of any aches and pains for you to treat this
morning, Doctor.'</p>

<p>'Oh.' The Doctor shrugged. 'Well, that's good news,' she said,
picking up her bag and turning for the door. 'I'll bid you good day
then, sir.'</p>


<p>'Ah!' the King said suddenly. We each turned again.</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>


<p>The King looked most thoughtful for a moment, then shook his
head. 'No, Doctor, I can think of nothing with which to detain you.
You may go. I shall call you when I need you next.'</p>


<p>'Of course, sir.'</p>


<p>Wiester opened the doors for us.</p>

<p>'Doctor?' the King said as we were in the doorway. 'Duke Ormin
and I go hunting this afternoon. I usually fall off my mount or get
torn up by a barb bush, so I may well have something for you to
treat later.'</p>

<p>Duke Ormin laughed politely and shook his head.</p>

<p>'I shall start to prepare the relevant potions now,' the Doctor
said. 'Your majesty.'</p>

<p>'Providence, twice.'</p>

<h3 class="chapter">8. THE BODYGUARD</h3>

<p>'Am I so trusted now?</p>

<p>'Or I am. Probably because I am regarded as being beyond the
interest of any but the most desperate of men. Or because the
General does not intend to visit me again and so&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Careful!'</p>

<p>DeWar grabbed at Perrund's arm just as she was about to step
from the street-side into the path of a ten-team of mounts hauling
a war carriage. He pulled her back towards him as first the
panting, sweat-lathered team and then the great swaying bulk of the
cannon-wagon itself raced past, shaking the cobblestones beneath
their feet. A smell of sweat and oil rolled over them. He felt her
draw away from it all, pressing her back against his chest. Behind
him, the stone counter of a butcher's shop dug into his back. The
noise of the wagon's man-high wheels resounded between the cracked,
uneven walls of the two- and three-storey buildings leaning over
the street.</p>

<p>On top of the huge black gun carriage a bombardier uniformed in
the colours of Duke Ralboute stood lashing wildly at the mounts.
The wagon was followed by two smaller carriages full of men and
wooden cases. These in turn were trailed by a ragged pack of
shouting children. The wagons thundered through the open gates set
within the inner city's walls and disappeared from view. People on
the street who had shrunk back from the speeding vehicles flowed
back into the thoroughfare again, muttering and shaking their
heads.</p>

<p>DeWar let Perrund go and she turned to him. He realised with a
flush of embarrassment that in his instinctive reaction to the
danger he had taken hold of her by the withered arm. The memory of
its touch, through the sleeve of her gown, the sling and the fold
of her cloak, seemed imprinted in the bones of his hand as
something thin, fragile and childlike.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry,' he said, blurting the words.</p>

<p>She was still very close to him. She stepped away, smiling
uncertainly. The hood of her cloak had fallen, revealing her
lace-veiled face and her golden hair, which was gathered inside a
black net. She drew the hood back up. 'Oh, DeWar,' she chided. 'You
save somebody's life and then you apologise. You really are &mdash; oh, I
don't know,' she said, readjusting the hood. DeWar had time to be
surprised. He had never known the lady Perrund lost for words. The
hood she was struggling with fell back again, caught by a gust of
wind. 'Damn thing,' she said, taking hold of it with her good arm
and pulling it back once more. He had started to put his hand up,
to help her with the hood, but now had to let his hand fall back.
'There,' she said. 'That's better. Here. I'll take your arm.
Now, let us walk.'</p>

<p>DeWar checked the street and then they crossed it, carefully
avoiding the small piles of animal dung. A warm wind blew up
between the buildings, lifting whirls of straw from the
cobblestones. Perrund held DeWar's arm with her good hand, her
forearm laid lightly on his. In DeWar's other hand he held a cane
basket she had asked him to carry for her when they'd left the
palace. 'Obviously I am not fit to be let out by myself,' she told
him. 'I have spent far too long in rooms and courtyards, and on
terraces and lawns. Everywhere, in fact, where there is no traffic
any larger or more threatening than a eunuch with an urgently
needed tray of scented waters.'</p>


<p>'I didn't hurt you, did I?' DeWar asked, glancing at her.</p>


<p>'No, but if you had I think I might still count it
better than being mangled beneath the iron wheels of a piece of
siege artillery proceeding at a charge. Where do you think they are
going in such a hurry?'</p>

<p>'Well, they won't go anywhere very far at that rate. The mounts
already looked half exhausted and that was before they'd left the
city. I imagine that was a show for the locals. But they will be
heading for Ladenscion eventually, I imagine.'</p>


<p>'Is the war begun, then?'</p>

<p>'What war, my lady?'</p>


<p>'The war against the troublesome barons of Ladenscion, DeWar. I
am not an idiot.'</p>

<p>DeWar sighed and looked around, checking that nobody in the
street was paying them too close attention. 'It is not officially
begun yet,' he said, putting his lips close to the hood of her
cloak &mdash; she turned towards him and he smelled her perfume, sweet
and musky &mdash; 'but I think one might safely say it is
inevitable.'</p>

<p>'How far away is Ladenscion?' she asked. They ducked under
displays of fruit hanging outside a grocer's.</p>

<p>'About twenty days' ride to the border hills.'</p>

<p>'Will the Protector have to go himself?'</p>

<p>'I really couldn't say.'</p>

<p>'DeWar,' she said softly, with what sounded like
disappointment.</p>

<p>He sighed and looked around again. 'I shouldn't think so,' he
said. 'He has much to do here, and there are more than enough
generals for the job. It . . . it shouldn't take too long.'</p>

<p>'You sound unconvinced.'</p>

<p>'Do I?' They stopped at a side street to let a small herd of
hauls pass, heading for the auction grounds. 'I seem to be in a
minority of one in thinking the war . . . suspicious.'</p>

<p>'Suspicious?' Perrund sounded amused.</p>

<p>'The barons' complaints and their stubbornness, their refusal to
negotiate, seem disproportionate.'</p>

<p>'You think they're inviting war for its own sake?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Well, not just for its own sake. Only a madman would do
that. But for some further reason than the desire to assert their
independence from Tassasen.'</p>

<p>'But what else could their motive be?'</p>

<p>'It is not their motive that troubles me.'</p>

<p>'Then whose?'</p>

<p>'Someone behind them.'</p>

<p>'They are being encouraged to make war?'</p>

<p>'It feels so to me, but I am just a bodyguard. The Protector is
cloistered with his generals now and believes he needs neither my
presence nor my opinion.'</p>

<p>'And I am grateful for your company. But I had formed the
impression the Protector valued your counsel.'</p>

<p>'It is most valued when it most closely accords with his own
view.'</p>

<p>'DeWar, you are not jealous, are you?' She stopped and turned to
him. He looked into her face, shaded and half hidden by the hood of
the cloak and the thin veil. Her skin seemed to glow in that
darkness like a hoard of gold at the back of a cave.</p>

<p>'Maybe I am,' he admitted, with a bashful grin. 'Or perhaps I am
once again exercising my duties in areas which are
inappropriate.'</p>

<p>'As in our game.'</p>

<p>'As in our game.'</p>

<p>They turned together and walked on. She took his arm again.
'Well then, who do you think might be behind the vexatious
barons?'</p>

<p>'Kizitz, Breistler, Velfasse. Any one or combination of our
three claimant Emperors. Kizitz will make mischief wherever he can.
Breistler has a claim to part of Ladenscion itself and might seek
to offer his forces as compromise occupants to keep the barons' and
our armies apart. Velfasse has his eye on our eastern provinces.
Drawing our forces to the west might be a feint. Faross would like
the Thrown Isles back, and may have a similar strategy. Then
there's Haspidus.'</p>

<p>'Haspidus?' she said. 'I thought King Quience supported
UrLeyn.'</p>

<p>'It may suit him to be seen to support UrLeyn for now. But
Haspidus lies behind &mdash; beyond &mdash; Ladenscion. It would be easier for
Quience to provide the barons with materiel than anybody else.'</p>

<p>'And you think Quience opposes the Protector out of Regal
principle? Because UrLeyn dared to kill a king?'</p>

<p>'Quience knew the old king. He and Beddun were as close to being
friends as two kings can be, so there might be something of the
personal in his animosity. But even without that, Quience is no
fool, and he has no pressing problems to occupy him at the moment.
He has the luxury of time to think long, and the brains to know
that UrLeyn's example cannot go unopposed for ever if he wishes to
pass on the crown to his heirs.'</p>

<p>'But Quience has no children yet, does he?'</p>

<p>'None that are regarded as mattering, and he has yet to decide
who to marry, but even if he was concerned only for his own reign,
he might still want to see the Protectorate fail.'</p>

<p>'Dear me. I had no idea we were quite so surrounded by
enemies.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid we are, my lady.'</p>

<p>'Ah. Here we are.'</p>

<p>The old stone-built building across the crowded street from them
was the paupers' hospital. It was here Perrund had wanted to come
with her basket of foods and medicines. 'My old home,' she said,
staring over the heads of the people. A small troop of colourfully
dressed soldiers appeared round a corner and came marching down the
street, attended by a boy drummer at their head, tearful women to
each side and capering children behind. Everybody turned to look
except Perrund. Her gaze remained fixed on the worn, stained stones
of the old hospital across the street.</p>

<p>DeWar looked this way and that. 'Have you been back since?' he
asked.</p>

<p>'No. But I have kept in touch. I have sent them some little
things in the past. I thought it would be amusing to deliver them
myself this time. Oh. What are those?' The troop of soldiers was
passing in front of them. The soldiers wore bright red and yellow
uniforms and polished metal hats. Each carried a long wood-mounted
metal tube slung slanted across their shoulders and waving in the
air above their gleaming helmets.</p>

<p>'Musketeers, my lady,' DeWar told her. 'And that is Duke
Simalg's banner at their head.'</p>

<p>'Ah. These are the musket guns. I have heard about them.'</p>

<p>DeWar watched the troop pass with a troubled, distracted look.
'UrLeyn won't have them in the palace,' he said eventually. 'They
can be useful on the battlefield.'</p>

<p>The sound of the beating drum faded. The street filled again
with its ordinary commerce. A gap opened in the traffic of carts
and carriages between them and the hospital, and DeWar thought they
would take advantage of it, but Perrund lingered on the pavement,
her hand clutching at his forearm while she stared at the ornate
and time-stained stonework of the ancient building.</p>

<p>DeWar cleared his throat. 'Will there be anybody there from when
you were?'</p>

<p>'The present matron was a nurse when I was here. It's her I've
corresponded with.' Still she did not move.</p>


<p>'Were you here long?'</p>


<p>'Only ten days or so. It was only five years ago, but it seems
much longer.' She kept staring at the building.</p>

<p>DeWar was not sure what to say. 'It must have been a difficult
time.'</p>

<p>From what he had succeeded in teasing from her over the past few
years, DeWar knew that Perrund had been brought here suffering from
a terrible fever. She and eight of her sisters, brothers and
cousins had been refugees from the war of succession during which
UrLeyn had taken control of Tassasen following the fall of the
Empire. Travelling from the southlands where the fighting had been
worst, they had made for Crough, along with a large part of the
rest of the population of Tassasen's south. The family had been
traders in a market town, but most of them had been killed by the
King's forces when they had taken the town from UrLeyn's troops.
The General's men had retaken it, with UrLeyn at their head, but by
then Perrund and her few remaining relatives were on the road for
the capital.</p>

<p>They had all contracted some form of plague on the journey and
only a hefty bribe had got them through the city gates at all. The
least sick of them had driven their wagon to one of the old royal
parks where refugees could camp and the last of their money had
paid for a doctor and medicines. Most of them had died then.
Perrund had been found a place in the paupers' hospital. She had
come close to death but then recovered. When she had gone in search
of the rest of her family her quest had ended at the lime pits
beyond the city walls where people had been buried hundreds at a
time.</p>

<p>She had thought of killing herself then, but was afraid to, and
besides considered that as Providence had seen fit to have her
recover from the plague, perhaps she was not meant to die quite
yet. There was, anyway, a general feeling that the worst of times
might be over. The war had ended, the plague had all but
disappeared and order had returned to Crough and was returning to
the rest of Tassasen.</p>

<p>Perrund had helped out at the hospital, sleeping on the floor of
one of the great open wards where people wept and shouted and
moaned throughout the day and night. She had begged for food in the
street and she had turned down many an offer that would have let
her buy food and comfort with her sex, but then a eunuch of the
palace harem &mdash; UrLeyn's, now that the old King was dead &mdash; had
visited the hospital. The doctor who had found Perrund a place in
the hospital had told a friend at court that she was a great
beauty, and &mdash; once she had been persuaded to clean her face and put
on a dress &mdash; the eunuch had thought her suitable.</p>

<p>So she was recruited to the languid opulence of the harem, and
became a frequent choice of the Protector. What would have seemed
like a restrictive kind of luxury, even a sort of well-furnished
prison to the young woman she had been a year earlier, when she and
her family were living together and peaceably in their prosperous
little market town, she saw instead, after the war and everything
that had come with it, as a blessed sanctuary.</p>

<p>Then had come the day when UrLeyn and various of his court
favourites, including some of his concubines, were to be painted by
a famous artist. The artist brought with him a new assistant who
turned out to have a mission of rather more serious intent than
simply helping to fix UrLeyn's and the others' likenesses in paint,
and only Perrund throwing herself between his knife and UrLeyn had
saved the Protector's life.</p>

<p>'Shall we?' DeWar asked, when Perrund still had not moved from
the pavement.</p>

<p>She looked at him as though she had forgotten he was there, then
she smiled from the depths of the hood. 'Yes,' she said. 'Yes,
let's.'</p>

<p>She held his arm tightly as they crossed the street.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Tell me more about Lavishia.'</p>

<p>'Where? Oh, Lavishia. Let me think. Well now, in Lavishia
everybody is able to fly.'</p>


<p>'Like birds? Lattens asked.</p>


<p>'Just like birds,' DeWar confirmed. 'They can leap from cliffs
and tall buildings &mdash; of which there are a great many in Lavishia &mdash;
or they can just run along the street and jump into the air and
soar away up into the sky.'</p>


<p>'Do they have wings??</p>

<p>'They do have wings but they are invisible wings.'</p>

<p>'Can they fly to the suns?'</p>


<p>'Not on their own. To fly to the suns they have to use ships.
Ships with invisible sails.'</p>


<p>'Don't they burn in the heat of the suns??</p>


<p>'Not the sails, they're invisible and the heat goes straight
through them. But the wooden hulls scorch and blacken and burst
into flame if they go too close, of course.'</p>


<p>'How far is it to the suns?'</p>


<p>'I don't know, but people say that they are different distances
away, and some clever people claim that they are both very far away
indeed.'</p>

<p>'These would be the same clever people called mathematicians who
tell us the world is a ball, and not flat,' Perrund said.</p>

<p>'They would,' DeWar confirmed.</p>

<p>A travelling troupe of shadow players had come to court. They
had set up in the palace's theatre, whose plaster windows had
shutters which could be closed against the light. They had
stretched a white sheet very tightly across a wooden frame whose
lower edge was just above head height. Below the frame hung a black
cloth. The white screen was lit from behind by a single strong lamp
set some distance back. Two men and two women manipulated the
two-dimensional puppets and their accompanying shadow-scenery,
using thin sticks to make the characters' limbs and bodies swivel.
Effects like waterfalls and flames were achieved using thin strips
of dark paper and bellows to make them flutter. Using a variety of
voices, the players told ancient stories of kings and queens,
heroes and villains, fidelity and betrayal and love and hate.</p>

<p>It was the interval now. DeWar had been round the back of the
screen to make sure that the two guards he had stationed there were
still awake, and they were. The shadow players had objected at
first, but he had insisted the guards stay there. UrLeyn was
sitting in the middle of the small auditorium, a perfect and
stationary target for somebody behind the screen with a crossbow.
UrLeyn, Perrund and everybody else who had heard about the two
guards behind the screen thought DeWar was once again taking his
duties far too seriously, but he could not have sat there and
watched the show comfortably with nobody he trusted behind the
screen. He had stationed guards by the window shutters too, with
instructions to open them promptly if the lantern behind the screen
went out.</p>

<p>These precautions taken, he had been able to watch the shadow
players' performance &mdash; from the seat immediately behind UrLeyn &mdash;
with a degree of equanimity, and when Lattens had clambered over
the seat in front and come and sat on his lap demanding to know
more about Lavishia he had felt sufficiently relaxed to be happy to
oblige. Perrund, sitting one seat along from UrLeyn, had turned
round to ask her question about mathematicians. She watched DeWar
and Lattens with an amused, indulgent expression.</p>

<p>'Can they fly under the water, too?' Lattens asked. He wriggled
off DeWar's lap and stood in front of him, an intent look on his
face. He was dressed like a little soldier, with a wooden sword at
his side in a decorated scabbard.</p>

<p>'They certainly can. They are very good at holding their breath
and can do it for days at a time.'</p>

<p>'And can they fly through mountains?'</p>

<p>'Only through tunnels, but they have lots of tunnels. Of course,
some of the mountains are hollow. And others are full of
treasure.'</p>


<p>'Are there wizards and enchanted swords?'</p>


<p>'Yes, enchanted swords by the cistern-full, and lots of wizards.
Though they tend to be a trifle arrogant.'</p>


<p>'And are there giants and monsters?'</p>


<p>'Plenty of both, though they are all very nice giants and
extremely helpful monsters.'</p>

<p>'How boring,' Perrund murmured, reaching out her good hand and
patting down some of Lattens' more wayward curls.</p>

<p>UrLeyn turned round in his seat, eyes twinkling. He drank from a
glass of wine then said, 'What's this, DeWar? Are you filling my
boy's head with nonsense?'</p>

<p>'There would be a wonder,' said BiLeth, from a couple of seats
away. The tall foreign minister looked bored with the
proceedings.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I am, sir,' DeWar admitted to UrLeyn, ignoring
BiLeth. 'I'm telling him about kind giants and pleasant monsters,
when everybody knows that giants are cruel and monsters are
terrifying.'</p>

<p>'Preposterous,' BiLeth said.</p>

<p>'What's that?' RuLeuin asked, also turning round. UrLeyn's
brother sat beside him on the other side from Perrund. He was one
of the few generals who had not been sent off to Ladenscion.
'Monsters? We have seen monsters on the screen, haven't we,
Lattens?'</p>

<p>'Which would you rather have, Lattens?' UrLeyn asked his son.
'Good giants and monsters, or bad ones?'</p>

<p>'Bad ones!' Lattens shouted. He drew his wooden sword from its
scabbard. 'So I can cut their heads off!'</p>

<p>'That's the boy!' his father said.</p>

<p>'Indeed! Indeed!' BiLeth agreed.</p>

<p>UrLeyn shoved his wine goblet at RuLeuin and then reached over
to pull Lattens up off his feet, depositing him in front of him
and making to fence the child with a dagger still in its sheath.
Lattens' face took on a look of great concentration. He fenced with
his father, thrusting and parrying, feinting and dodging. The
wooden sword clicked and clacked off the sheathed dagger. 'Good!'
his father said. 'Very good!'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DeWar watched Commander ZeSpiole get up from his seat and
shuffle sideways towards the aisle. DeWar excused himself and
followed, meeting up with the other man in the privy beneath the
theatre, where one of the shadow players and a couple of guards
were also making use of the facility.</p>

<p>'Did you receive your report, Commander?' DeWar asked.</p>

<p>ZeSpiole looked up, surprised. 'Report, DeWar?'</p>

<p>'About my and the lady Perrund's trip to her old hospital.'</p>

<p>'Why should that occasion a report, DeWar?'</p>

<p>'I thought it might because one of your men followed us there
from the palace.'</p>

<p>'Really, who was that?'</p>

<p>'I don't know his name. But I recognised him. Shall I point him
out the next time I see him? If he was not acting on your orders
you may wish to ask him why he has taken to following people going
about their honest and officially sanctioned business in the
city.'</p>

<p>ZeSpiole hesitated, then said, 'That will not be necessary,
thank you. I'm sure that any such report, supposing it had been
made, would state only that yourself and the concubine concerned
paid a perfectly innocent visit to the said institution and
returned without incident.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure it would, too.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DeWar returned to his seat. The shadow players announced they
were ready to begin the second half of their show. Lattens had to
be calmed down before it could be resumed. When it did, he squirmed
in his seat between his father and Perrund for a while, but Perrund
stroked his head and made quiet, shushing, soothing noises, and
before too long the shadow players' stories started to reclaim the
boy's interest.</p>

<p>He had the seizure about halfway through the second half,
suddenly going rigid and starting to shake. DeWar noticed it first,
and sat forward, about to say something, then Perrund turned, her
face glowing in the screen light, shadows dancing across it, a
frown forming there. 'Lattens . . . ?' she said.</p>

<p>The boy made a strange, strangling sound and jerked, falling off
his seat at the feet of his father, who looked startled and said,
'What?'</p>

<p>Perrund left her seat and sank down by the boy.</p>

<p>DeWar stood up and turned to face the rear of the theatre.
'Guards! The shutters! Now!'</p>

<p>The shutters creaked and light spilled down the banked rows of
seats. Startled faces peered out of the sudden light. People
started looking round at the windows, muttering. The shadow
players' screen had gone white, the shadows disappearing. The man's
voice telling the background story halted, confused.</p>

<p>'Lattens!' UrLeyn said, as Perrund started to set the boy into a
sitting position. Lattens' eyes were closed, his face grey and
sheened with sweat. 'Lattens!' UrLeyn lifted his child up into his
arms.</p>

<p>DeWar remained standing, his gaze flitting about the theatre.
Others were standing too, now. A bank of worried-looking faces were
arranged before him, all looking down at the Protector.</p>

<p>'Doctor!' DeWar shouted when he saw BreDelle. The portly doctor
stood blinking in the light.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="chapter">9. THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p>Master, I thought it right to include in my report mention of
the events which took place in the Hidden Gardens on the day Duke
Quettil presented Geographer Kuin's latest map of the world to the
King.</p>

<p>We had arrived at the summer palace of Yvenir in the Yvenage
Hills on schedule and were happily settled into the Doctor's
quarters, in a round tower of the Lesser House. The view from our
rooms took in the scattered houses and pavilions set within the
wooded lower slopes of Palace Hill. These buildings gradually
increased in number while the distances between them shrank until
they merged against the ancient walls of Mizui city itself, which
filled the flat bottom of the valley immediately beneath the
palace. On the valley floor to either side of Mizui could be seen
numerous farms, fields and water meadows, while behind these
climbed gently forested hills, themselves surmounted by the round,
snow-covered mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>The King had indeed fallen off his mount while hunting near
Lep-Skatacheis (though it had been on the last day of our stop
there, not the first) and had been hobbling round since then on a
badly twisted ankle. The Doctor had strapped the ankle and done
what she could, but the King's duties were such that he could not
rest the limb as much as the Doctor wanted him to, and so it took a
while to heal.</p>

<p>'You. Yes, more wine. No, not that stuff. That. Ah. Adlain. Come
and sit by me.'</p>

<p>'Majesty.'</p>

<p>'Wine for the Guard Commander. Come on. You have to be quicker
than that. A good servant acts to carry out a master's wishes even
as the wish is still being formed. Isn't that so, Adlain?'</p>

<p>'I was about to say that myself, sir.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure you were. What news?'</p>

<p>'Oh, mostly the woes of the world, sir. Hardly fit to be
revealed in a fine place like this. It might spoil the view.'</p>

<p>We were in the Hidden Gardens behind the Great Palace, almost at
the summit of the hill. The red, creeper-covered garden walls hid
all but the highest towers of the palace. The view from the little
hanging valley which contained the gardens led the eye down to the
distant plains, which were blue with distance and faded out into
the light of the sky at the horizon.</p>

<p>'Any sign of Quettil?' the King asked. 'He's supposed to be
giving me something or other. All has to be arranged of course,
being Quettil. Can't just happen. No doubt we're due to get the
full pomp.'</p>

<p>'The Duke Quettil is not one to murmur when a shout might
attract more attention,' Adlain agreed, taking off his hat and
setting it on the long table. 'But I understand the map he intends
to present to you is a particularly fine one, and long in the
making. I expect we shall all be most impressed.'</p>

<p>Duke Quettil occupied the Duke's Palace within the grounds of
Palace Hill. The Province and Dukedom of Quettil, of which the city
of Mizui and the Yvenage Hills were but a modest part, was entirely
his to command, and he was, by repute, not shy about imposing his
authority. He and his retinue were due to enter the Hidden Gardens
shortly after the midday bell to present the King with his new
map.</p>

<p>'Adlain,' the King said. 'You know the new Duke Ulresile?'</p>

<p>'Duke Ulresile,' Adlain said to the thin, sallow youth at the
King's left side. 'I was sorry to hear about your father.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' the boy said. He was barely older than I, and less
substantial, more wispy. The fine clothes he wore looked too big
for him, and he appeared uncomfortable. He had, I thought, yet to
take on the look of a powerful man.</p>

<p>'Duke Walen,' Adlain said, bowing to the older man, who sat to
the King's right.</p>

<p>'Adlain,' Walen said. 'You look as though the mountain air suits
you.'</p>

<p>'I have yet to find air that does not, thank you, Duke.'</p>

<p>King Quience sat at a long table set within a shady pergola,
attended by the Dukes Walen and Ulresile, a smattering of lesser
nobility and various servants, including a pair of Palace serving
girls who were identical twin sisters and to whom the King seemed
to have taken a particular shine. Each had gold-green eyes,
yellow-white tangles of hair and seemed to be almost but not
entirely in control of tall, sinuous bodies that in places appeared
to defy the law of gravity. Each was clothed in a cream-coloured
dress edged with red piping and ruffled with lace, which, if not
exactly what a rustic shepherdess might wear, was perhaps what a
famously handsome and well-endowed actress might have worn if she
was taking part in an expensively produced Romantic Play which
featured rustic shepherdesses. One such creature might have caused
a normal fellow's heart to melt into his boots. That there were two
such beauties capable of occupying the same world at once seemed
unfair. Especially as both seemed quite as taken with the King as
he did with them.</p>

<p>I confess that I had been unable to take my eyes off the two
golden-brown globes which bulged like swollen fawn moons at the
lacy cream horizon of each girl's bodice. The sunlight poured down
over those perfect orbs, highlighting the nearly invisibly fine
down there, their voices tinkled like the fountains, their musky
perfume filled the air, and the King's very talk and tone taunted
and teased with the implication of romance.</p>

<p>'Yes, those little red ones. Some of those. Mmm. Delicious. How
one does enjoy those little red ones, eh?'</p>


<p>The two girls giggled.</p>


<p>'How's it looking, Vosill?' the King said, still smirking. 'When
can I start chasing these girls?' He made to lunge at the
shepherdesses and tried to grab them, but they yelped and danced
out of the way. 'They keep getting away from me, dammit. When can I
start hunting them properly?'</p>


<p>'Properly, sir? How would that be?' the Doctor asked.</p>


<p>The Doctor and I were there tending to the King's ankle. The
Doctor changed the strapping on it every day. Sometimes she changed
it twice a day if the King had been out riding or hunting. As well
as the swelling from the sprain, there was a small cut on the ankle
which was taking its time to heal, and the Doctor was scrupulous in
keeping this cleaned and treated, nevertheless it still seemed to
me that any common nurse or even chamber-servant could have
performed this function. However, the King appeared to want the
Doctor to do it each day herself, and she seemed quite happy to
acquiesce. I cannot think of any other doctor who might have made
an excuse not to treat the King, but she was quite capable of
it.</p>

<p>'Why, properly in the sense of having a decent chance of
catching them, Vosill,' the King said, leaning forward towards the
Doctor and using what is, I believe, called a stage whisper. The
two shepherdesses laughed tinklingly.</p>

<p>'Decent, sir? How so?' the Doctor asked, and blinked, it seemed
to me, more than the flower- and leaf-shaded sunlight called
for.</p>

<p>'Vosill, stop asking these childish questions and tell me when I
may run again.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you may run now, sir. But it would be most painful, and
your ankle would probably give way within a few dozen steps. But
you most certainly can run.'</p>

<p>'Aye, run but fall over,' the King said, sitting back and
reaching for his wine glass.</p>

<p>The Doctor glanced at the two shepherdesses. 'Well,' she said,
'perhaps something soft would break your fall.'</p>

<p>She sat at the King's feet with her back to Duke Walen,
cross-legged. This odd and unladylike position was one she adopted
often, seemingly without thinking, and which made her adoption of
men's clothes, or at least some part of them, almost a necessity.
For once, the Doctor had changed out of her long boots. She wore
dark hose and soft pointed shoes of velvet. The King's feet rested
on solid silver footstools topped with plump cushions, vividly dyed
and patterned. The Doctor washed the King's feet as usual,
inspected them and, on this occasion, carefully trimmed his
toe-nails. I was left to sit on a small stool at her side, holding
her bag open while she lost herself in this labour.</p>

<p>'Would you break my fall, my lovelies?' the King asked, sitting
back in his chair.</p>

<p>The two girls dissolved into laughter again. (The Doctor, I
think, muttered something about being most sure to if he landed on
their heads.)</p>

<p>'They might break your heart, sir,' Adlain observed,
smiling.</p>

<p>'Indeed,' Walen said. 'With one to pull in each direction, a man
might suffer terribly.'</p>

<p>The two serving girls giggled and fed more little pieces of
fruit to the King, who made to tickle them with a long feather from
a fan-tailed tsigibern. Musicians played on a terrace behind us,
fountains plashed melodiously, insects hummed but did not annoy us,
the air was fresh and full of the scent of flowers and freshly
tilled and watered earth, and the two servant girls bent and leant
to pop fruits into the King's mouth, then squealed, jumped and
jiggled when he lunged at them with his feather. I confess I was
glad I did not have to pay too much attention to what the Doctor
was doing.</p>

<p>'Do try to keep still, sir,' she muttered as the King stabbed at
the two girls with the tsigibern feather.</p>

<p>Chamberlain Wiester came panting up the path beneath the flowers
and vines, his splendidly buckled shoes glinting in the sunlight
and crunching on the semi-precious path stones. 'Duke Quettil, your
majesty,' he announced. A blare of trumpets and a clash of cymbals
sounded from the garden gates, followed by the roaring scream of
what sounded like a fierce and angry animal. 'And retinue,' Wiester
added.</p>

<p>Duke Quettil arrived with a bevy of maidens scattering
scent-crushed petals in his path, a troupe of jugglers tossing
glittering clubs back and forth across the path, a band of
trumpeteers and cymbalists, a pride of chokered, growling galkes
each with its own grim, oiled and muscled handler straining to keep
his charge in order, a school of identically dressed clerks and
retainers, a clutch of beefy-looking men clad only in loin cloths
supporting what looked like a tall thin wardrobe on a bier, and a
pair of tall, pitch-skinned Equatorials holding a tasselled parasol
over the Duke himself, who was transported on a litter glittering
with precious metals and cut stones by an octet of toweringly
statuesque golden-skinned balnimes, each bald and naked save for a
tiny cache-sex and accoutred with a huge long bow slung over their
shoulder.</p>

<p>The Duke was dressed, as they say, fit to embarrass an Emperor.
His robes were predominantly red and gold, and his ample frame
displayed them to some effect as the balnimes lowered his litter, a
step-stool was placed by his slippered feet and he stepped on to a
gold-cloth carpet. Above his round, full, eyebrow-less face, his
jewelled head-dress sparkled in the sun and his many-ringed fingers
were heavy with gems as he made a sweeping if awkward bow to the
King.</p>

<p>The trumpets and cymbals fell silent. The musicians on the
terrace had given up trying to compete with the trumpeteers and
cymbalists as soon as they'd entered, so we were left with the
sounds of the garden itself, plus the galkes' growling.</p>


<p>'Duke Quettil,' said the King. 'An impromptu visit?'</p>

<p>Quettil smiled broadly.</p>


<p>The King laughed. 'Good to see you, Duke. I think you know
everybody here.'</p>

<p>Quettil nodded to Walen and Ulresile, then to Adlain and a few
others. He couldn't see the Doctor because she was on the far side
of the table, still tending to the King's feet.</p>

<p>'Your majesty,' Quettil said. 'As a further token of our honour
at being allowed to play host to you and your court here again for
the summer, I wish to make a presentation.' The oiled muscle-men
brought the bier in front of where the King sat and set it down.
They opened the richly carved and inlaid doors of the thin
container to reveal a huge square map easily the height of a man.
Set within the square was a circle, filled with the shapes of
continents and islands and seas and embellished with monsters,
drawings of cities and small figures of men and women in a huge
variety of dress. 'A map of the world, sir,' Quettil said.
'Prepared for you by the Master Geographer Kuin from the very
latest intelligence purchased by your humble servant and passed on
to him by the most brave and reliable captains of the four
waters.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Duke.' The King sat forward in his seat, peering at
the map. 'Does it show the site of Anlios of old?'</p>

<p>Quettil looked at one of his liveried servants, who stepped
forward quickly and said, 'Yes, your majesty. Here.' He
pointed.</p>

<p>'What of the lair of the monster Gruissens?'</p>

<p>'Believed to be here, your majesty, in the region of the
Vanishing Isles.'</p>

<p>'And Sompolia?'</p>

<p>'Ah, home of Mimarstis the Mighty,' Quettil said.</p>

<p>'So people claim,' the King said.</p>

<p>'Here, your majesty.'</p>

<p>'And is Haspide still in the centre of the world?' the King
asked.</p>

<p>'Ah,' said the servant.</p>

<p>'In every sense but the physical, sir,' Quettil said, looking a
little discomfited. 'I did ask Master Geographer Kuin for the most
accurate map it might be possible to draw up with the latest and
most trustworthy information, and he has chosen &mdash; one might almost
say decreed &mdash; that the Equator must be the waist-band of the world
for the purposes of accurate mapmaking. As Haspide lies some goodly
distance from the Equator, it cannot therefore assume the&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Quettil, it doesn't matter,' the King said airily, waving one
hand. 'I prefer accuracy to flattery. It is a most magnificent map
and I thank you sincerely. It will sit in my throne room so that
all may admire it, and I shall have more utilitarian copies drawn
up for our sea captains. I think I have never seen a single object
which contrives to be at once so decorous and yet so useful. Come
and sit by me. Duke Walen, will you kindly make room for our
visitor?'</p>

<p>Walen muttered that he would be glad to, and servants scraped
his chair away from the King's, leaving room for the balnimes to
swing Quettil's litter round the table and set it by the King. The
Duke resumed his seat. The balnimes smelled strongly of some
animalistic musk. My head seemed to spin. They retreated to the
rear of the terrace and squatted on their haunches, long bows
aslant behind.</p>

<p>'And what is this?' Quettil said, looking down from his fabulous
seat at the Doctor and myself.</p>

<p>'My physician,' the King told him, smiling broadly at the
Doctor.</p>

<p>'What, a foot-doctor?' Quettil asked. 'Is this some new fashion
of Haspide I've not heard about??</p>

<p>'No, a doctor for all the body, as any royal physician must be.
As Tranius was to my father. And to me.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Duke Quettil said, looking around. 'Tranius. What of
him?'</p>

<p>'He fell prey to shaking hands and blurred sight,' the King told
him. 'He retired to his farm in Junde.'</p>

<p>'Apparently the rural life suits him,' Adlain added. 'For by all
accounts the old fellow has made a full recovery.'</p>

<p>'Ormin recommended Doctor Vosill without reserve,' Quience told
the Duke, 'save that for the loss of her services to himself and
his family.'</p>

<p>'But ... a <em<woman</em>?' Quettil said, letting one of his servants
taste his wine and then accepting the crystal. 'You entrust more
than one organ to a woman's care? You are a brave man indeed,
sir.'</p>

<p>The Doctor had sat back and twisted a little so that she had her
back to the table. In this position she was able to face both the
King and Quettil. She said nothing, though there was a small, tight
smile on her face. I began to be alarmed. 'Doctor Vosill has been
invaluable this last year,' the King said.</p>

<p>'What's that? Without value? Valueless?' Quettil said with a
humourless smile, and reached out with one slippered foot to prod
the Doctor in the elbow. She rocked back slightly and looked down
at the place where the jewelled slipper had touched her. I felt my
mouth become dry.</p>

<p>'Indeed without value because she is beyond value,' Quience said
smoothly. 'I value my life above all else, and the good doctor here
helps to preserve it. She is as good as part of me.'</p>

<p>'Part of you?' Quettil scoffed. 'But it is a man's part to be
part of a woman, sir. You are, as ever, far too generous, my
King.'</p>

<p>'I have heard,' Guard Commander Adlain said, 'people say
something of that nature. That the King's only fault is that he is
too indulgent. In fact he is precisely as indulgent as he needs to
be to discover those who would take advantage of his sense of
fairness and his desire to be tolerant. Having so discovered
them&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, Adlain,' the Duke Quettil said, waving a hand towards
the Guard Commander, who fell silent and looked down at the table.
'I'm sure. But even so, to let a woman look after you . . . Your
majesty, I am only thinking of the good of the Kingdom which you
inherited from the man I was privileged to regard as my best
friend, your good father. What would he have said?'</p>

<p>Quience's expression darkened for a moment. Then it brightened
and said, 'He might have let the lady speak for herself.' The King
folded his hands and looked down at the Doctor. 'Doctor
Vosill?'</p>

<p>'Sir?'</p>

<p>'I have been given a present by Duke Quettil. A map of the
world. Would you care to admire it? Perhaps you can even give us
your thoughts on it, as you have travelled over more of the globe
than the rest of us.'</p>

<p>The Doctor rose smoothly from her cross-legged sitting position
to stand and swivel and look at the great map displayed on the far
side of the table. She gazed at it for a moment then reversed her
earlier motion, turning and folding herself down again and taking
up a small pair of scissors. Before she applied them to the King's
toe-nails, she looked at the Duke and said, 'The representation is
inaccurate, sir.'</p>

<p>Duke Quettil looked down upon the Doctor and gave a small, high
laugh. He glanced at the King and looked as though he was trying to
control a sneer. 'You think so, madam?' he said in an icy tone.</p>

<p>'I know so, sir,' the Doctor said, busying herself at the quick
of the King's left big toe and frowning mightily. 'Oelph, the
smaller scalpel . . . Oelph.' I jumped, dug in her bag and handed
her the tiny instrument with a shaking hand.</p>

<p>'What do you know of such matters, might I ask, madam?' the Duke
Quettil asked, glancing at the King again.</p>

<p>'Perhaps the lady doctor is a Mistress Geographer,' Adlain
suggested.</p>

<p>'Perhaps she should be taught some manners,' Duke Walen said
testily.</p>

<p>'I have travelled round the world, Duke Quettil,' the Doctor
said, as though addressing the King's toe, 'and seen the reality of
much of what is shown, rather fancifully, on your map.'</p>

<p>'Doctor Vosill,' the King said, not unkindly. 'It might be more
polite if you were to stand and look at the Duke when you address
him.'</p>

<p>'Might it, sir?'</p>

<p>The King withdrew his foot from her hand as he sat forward and
said sharply, 'Yes, madam, it might.'</p>

<p>The Doctor gave the King such a look I began to whimper, though
I think I was able to turn the sound into a clearing of the throat.
However, she paused, handed me back the small scalpel and stood
smoothly again. She bowed to the King and then the Duke. 'With your
permission, sirs,' she said, then took up the tsigibern feather
which the King had left lying on the table. She dropped, ducking
under the long table and appearing on the far side. She pointed at
the lower part of the great map with the feather.</p>

<p>'There is no continent here, only ice. There are island groups
here and here. The Northern Isles of Drezen are simply not as
shown. They are more numerous, generally smaller, less regular and
extend further to the north. Here, the westernmost Cape of Quarreck
is shown twenty sails' or so too far to the east. Cuskery . . .'
She tipped her head to one side, considering. 'Is shown fairly
accurately. Fuol is not here, it's here, though the whole continent
of Morifeth is shown . . . slanted to the west here. Illerne is
north of Chroe, not opposite it. These are the places I know of
from personal knowledge. I have it on good authority that there is
a great inland sea . . . here. As for the various monsters and
other nonsenses&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Doctor,' the King said, and clapped his hands. 'Your
views have been most amusing, I'm sure. Duke Quettil has doubtless
gained great insight from watching his splendid plan suffer such
correction.' The King turned to a grim-faced Quettil. 'You must
forgive the good doctor, my dear Duke. She is from Drezen, where
their brains seem to suffer from being upside-down all the time.
Obviously all is topsy-turvy there, and the women think it fit to
tell their lords and masters what is what.'</p>

<p>Quettil forced a smile. 'Indeed, sir. I quite understand. Still,
it was a most diverting display. I always held with your father
that it was both unseemly and unnecessary that women be allowed on
to a stage when castrati were so readily available, however I see
that women's fanciful and imaginative nature may be put to good use
when it comes to providing us with such humorous vignettes. I see
now that such frivolity and such licence is indeed most welcome. As
long as one does not take it too seriously, of course.'</p>

<p>I was watching the Doctor closely and with great trepidation as
the Duke spoke these words. Her expression, much to my relief,
stayed calm and untroubled. 'Do you think,' the Duke asked the
King, 'that she holds similarly picturesque views regarding the
location of the organs within the human body as she does the
features of the globe?'</p>

<p>'We must ask her. Doctor,' the King said. 'Do you disagree with
our best physicians and surgeons as you so obviously do with our
most esteemed navigators and map-makers?'</p>

<p>'On location, no, sir.'</p>

<p>'But from your tone,' Adlain said, 'you disagree on something.
What would that be?'</p>

<p>'Function, sir,' the Doctor told him. 'But that is mostly to do
with plumbing and so not perhaps of paramount interest.'</p>

<p>'Tell me, woman,' Duke Walen said. 'Did you have to leave this
land of Drezen to escape justice?'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked coldly at Duke Walen. 'No, sir.'</p>

<p>'Strange. I thought perhaps you might have tried the patience
and forbearance of your masters there, too, and so have had to flee
to escape their punishment.'</p>

<p>'I was free to stay and free to leave, sir,' the Doctor said
evenly. 'I chose to leave to travel the world and see how things
are elsewhere.'</p>

<p>'And found little you agree with, it would seem,' Duke Quettil
said. 'I am surprised you have not returned to wherever it was you
came from.'</p>

<p>'I have found the favour of a good and just king, sir,' the
Doctor said, laying the feather back on the table where she had
found it, then looking at the King as she put her hands behind her
back and drew herself up. 'I am privileged to be able to serve him
as best I can for as long as it pleases him. I consider that worth
all the hardships my journey entailed, and everything that I have
found disagreeable since I left my home.'</p>

<p>'The truth of it is that the Doctor is far too valuable to let
go,' the King assured Duke Quettil. 'She is practically our
prisoner, though we don't let her know that or she would at the
very least go into the most awful huff, would you not, Doctor?'</p>

<p>The Doctor lowered her head with a look that might almost have
been demure. 'Your majesty might banish me to the ends of the
world. I would still be the prisoner of his regard.'</p>

<p>'Providence, it can be almost civil at times!' Quettil roared
suddenly, slapping one hand on the table.</p>

<p>'She can even look handsome, in the right clothes and with her
hair done properly,' the King said, picking up the tsigibern
feather again and twirling it in front of his face. 'We shall have
a ball or two while we are here, I dare say. The Doctor will put on
her most feminine finery and amaze us all with daintiness and
grace. Won't you, Vosill?'</p>

<p>'If it please the King,' she said, though I noticed that her
lips were tight.</p>

<p>'Something we can all look forward to,' Duke Ulresile said
suddenly, then appeared to blush and quickly busied himself with
cutting a piece of fruit.</p>

<p>The other men looked at him, then all smiled and exchanged
knowing looks. The Doctor looked at the young man who had just
spoken. I thought I saw her eyes cross for a moment.</p>

<p>'Just so,' the King said. 'Wiester.'</p>

<p>'Your majesty?'</p>

<p>'Music, I think.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, sir.' Wiester turned to the musicians on the terrace
behind. Quettil dismissed most of his retinue. Ulresile
concentrated on eating enough to feed both the departed galkes and
the Doctor returned to the King's feet, rubbing fragrant oils into
the harder parts of the skin. The King sent the two shepherdesses
away.</p>

<p>'Adlain was about to give us some news, were you not,
Adlain?'</p>

<p>'I thought we might wait until we were inside, sir.'</p>

<p>The King looked round. 'I see nobody we cannot trust.'</p>

<p>Quettil was looking down at the Doctor, who looked up and said,
'Shall I go, sir?'</p>

<p>'Have you finished?'</p>

<p>'No, sir.'</p>

<p>'Then stay. Providence knows I have trusted you with my life
often enough and Quettil and Walen probably don't think you have
the memory or the wit to be an adequate spy, so assuming that we
trust young . . .'</p>

<p>'Oelph, sir,' the Doctor told the King. She smiled at me. 'I
have found him an honest and trustworthy apprentice.'</p>

<p>'. . . young Oelph here, I think we can talk with reasonable
freedom. My Dukes and Guard Commander may choose to spare you their
more spicy phrases, Doctor, or they may not, but I suspect you
would not blush to hear them anyway. Adlain.' The King turned to
the Guard Commander.</p>

<p>'Very well, sir. There have been several reports that someone in
a Sea Company delegation tried to assassinate the regicide UrLeyn,
about twelve days ago.'</p>

<p>'What?' the King exclaimed.</p>

<p>'I take it we must conclude that sadly this attempt did not
succeed?' Walen said.</p>

<p>Adlain nodded. 'The "Protector" escaped unharmed.'</p>

<p>'<em>What</em> Sea Company?' the King asked, eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>'One that probably does not really exist,' Adlain said. 'One
that several of the others fashioned specifically to make the
attempt. A single report has it that the members of the delegation
died under torture without revealing anything except their own sad
ignorance.'</p>

<p>'This is due to all the talk of forming a navy,' Walen said,
looking at Quience. 'It is foolishness, sir.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' the King agreed. 'But foolishness we must appear to
support for now.' He looked at Adlain. 'Contact all the ports. Send
a message to each of the Companies that enjoy our favour to the
effect that any further attempt on UrLeyn's life will meet with our
most profound and practical displeasure.'</p>


<p>'But sir!' Walen protested.</p>


<p>'UrLeyn continues to enjoy our support,' the King said with a
smile. 'We cannot be seen to oppose him, no matter how much his
demise may please us. The world is a changed place and too many
people are watching Tassasen to see what happens there. We must
trust to Providence that the Regicidal regime fails of its own
accord and so convinces others of its wrongness. If we are seen to
intervene to bring about its downfall from without we shall only
persuade the sceptical that there must have been some threat &mdash; and
therefore, by their way of thinking, some merit &mdash; in the
enterprise.'</p>

<p>'But sir,' Walen said, leaning forward and looking past Quettil
so that his old chin was almost on the table, 'Providence does not
always behave as we have the right to expect. I have had too many
opportunities to observe this in my life, sir. Even your dear
father, a man without peer in such matters, could be too prone to
waiting for Providence to accomplish with most painful slowness
what a quick and even merciful act could have achieved in a tenth
of the time. Providence does not move with the alacrity and
dispatch one might expect or desire, sir. Sometimes Providence
needs to be given a nudge in the right direction.' He looked
defiantly round the others. 'Aye, and a sharp nudge, at that.'</p>

<p>'I thought older men usually counselled patience,' Adlain
said.</p>

<p>'Only when that is what is required,' Walen told him. 'Now it is
not.'</p>

<p>'Nevertheless,' the King said with perfect equanimity. 'What
will happen to General UrLeyn will happen. I have an interest in
this that you may guess at, my dear Duke Walen, but neither you nor
anybody else who holds my favour worth the having may anticipate
it. Patience can be a means of letting matters mature to a proper
state for action, not just a way of letting time slip away.'</p>

<p>Walen looked at the King for a good few moments, then seemed to
accept what the King had said. 'Forgive an old man for whom the
furthest scope of patience may lie beyond that of his own grave,
your majesty.'</p>

<p>'We must hope that will not be so, for I would not wish you such
an early death, dear Duke.'</p>

<p>Walen looked reasonably mollified at this. Quettil patted his
hand, which the older man seemed not so sure about. 'The regicide
has more to worry about than assassins, in any event,' Duke Quettil
said.</p>

<p>'Ah,' the King said, sitting back with a contented look. 'Our
eastern problem.'</p>

<p>'Rather say UrLeyn's western one, sir.' Quettil smiled. 'We have
heard that he continues to send forces towards Ladenscion. Simalg
and Ralboute, two of his best generals, are already in the city of
Chaltoxern. They have issued an ultimatum to the barons that they
must open the high passes and allow the Protectorate's forces free
passage to the inner cities by Jairly's new moon, or suffer the
consequences.'</p>

<p>'And we have reason to believe that the barons' position might
be more robust than UrLeyn believes,' the King said, with a sly
smile.</p>


<p>'Rather a lot of reasons,' Quettil said. 'In fact, about. .
.' he began, but the King held up one hand and made a sort of
half-patting, half-waving motion and partially closed his eyes.
Quettil glanced round about us and gave a small slow nod.</p>

<p>'Duke Ormin, sir,' chamberlain Wiester said. The stooped figure
of the Duke Ormin came awkwardly up the path.</p>

<p>He halted by the tall map case, smiling and bowing. 'Sir. Ah,
Duke Quettil.'</p>

<p>'Ormin!' the King said (Quettil gave the most perfunctory of
nods). 'Good to see you. How is your wife?'</p>

<p>'Much better, sir. A slight fever, no more.'</p>


<p>'Sure you don't want Vosill here to take a look at her?'</p>


<p>'Quite sure, sir,' Ormin said, raising himself up on his feet to
look over the table. 'Ah, Doctor Vosill.'</p>


<p>'Sir,' the Doctor said to the Duke, bobbing briefly.</p>


<p>'Come and sit with us,' the King said. He looked around. Duke
Walen, would you &mdash; no, no.' Duke Walen's face had taken on the look
of a man told a poisonous insect has just fallen into his riding
boot. 'You moved before, didn't you . . . Adlain, would you make
room for the Duke?'</p>


<p>'With pleasure, sir.'</p>


<p>'Ah, a most magnificent map,' Duke Ormin said as he took his
seat.</p>


<p>'Isn't it?' the King said.</p>


<p>'Sir? Your majesty?' the young man to Walen's right piped
up.</p>


<p>'Duke Ulresile,' the King said.</p>


<p>'Might I go to Ladenscion?' the young Duke asked. He appeared at
last to be animated and even excited. When he had expressed his
anticipation at seeing the Doctor dressed for a ball he had seemed
only to make himself more callow. Now he appeared enthused, his
expression passionate. 'I and a few friends? We have all the
military means and a good number of men. We would put ourselves
under the authority of whatever baron you most trust and would
gladly fight for the&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My good Ulresile,' the King said. 'Your enthusiasm does you no
end of credit, but grateful though I am for the expression of such
an ambition, its fulfilment would lead only to my fury and
contempt.'</p>

<p>'How so, sir?' the young Duke asked, blinking furiously, his
face flushing.</p>

<p>'You sit here at my table, Duke Ulresile, you are known to enjoy
my favour and to accept my advice and that of Quettil here. Then
you go to fight the forces of one I have pledged to support and
must, I repeat, be seen to support, at least for now.'</p>


<p>'But&mdash;'</p>


<p>'You will find in any event, Ulresile,' Duke Quettil said,
glancing at Quience, 'that the King prefers to rely on his paid
generals rather than his nobles to command forces of any
significance.'</p>

<p>The King gave Quettil a controlled smile. 'It was the custom of
my dear father to trust major battles to those trained from an
early age in war and nothing else. My nobles command their lands
and their own leisure. They gather harems, improve their palaces,
commission great works of art, manipulate the taxes that we all
benefit from and oversee the improvement of land and the
furbishment of cities. In the new world that exists about us now,
that would appear to provide more than enough &mdash; indeed perhaps too
much &mdash; for a man to think about without having to concern himself
with the exigencies of war as well.'</p>

<p>Duke Ormin gave a small laugh. 'King Drasine used to say,' he
said, 'that war is neither science nor art. It is a craft, with
elements of both the scientific and the artistic about it, but a
craft nevertheless, and best left to craftsmen trained to it.'</p>


<p>'But sir!' Duke Ulresile protested.</p>


<p>The King held up one hand to him. 'I have no doubt that you and
your friends might carry many a battle, all on your own, and be
easily the equal of any one of my waged generals, but in winning
the day you might lose the year and even jeopardise the reign.
Matters are in hand, Ulresile.' The King smiled at the young Duke,
though he could not see it because he was staring tight-lipped at
the table. 'However,' the King continued, a tone of tolerant
amusement in his voice that had Ulresile look up briefly,
'by all means keep that fire stoked and your blade sharp. Your
day will come in due time.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' Ulresile said, looking back at the table.</p>

<p>'Now,' the King began, then became aware of some sort of
commotion at the gates to the palace.</p>

<p>'Majesty . . .' Wiester said, frowning in the same direction and
drawing himself up on tip-toes to see better.</p>

<p>'Wiester, what can you see?' the King asked.</p>

<p>'A servant, sir. Hurrying. Indeed, running.'</p>

<p>At this point, both the Doctor and I looked round, under the
table. And indeed, there was a plump youth in the uniform of the
palace footmen, running up the path.</p>

<p>'I thought they were not allowed to run for fear of scattering
the stones over the flower beds,' the King said, shading his eyes
against the sunlight's new slant.</p>

<p>'Indeed so, sir,' Wiester said, and assumed his most stern and
censorious expression as he stepped to the end of the table and
walked purposefully down to meet the lad, who stopped before him
and bent over to lean his hands on his knees while he panted,
'Sir!'</p>

<p>'What, boy?' Wiester bellowed.</p>

<p>'Sir, there's been a murder, sir!'</p>

<p>'A murder?' Wiester said, taking a step back and seeming to
shrink in on himself. The Guard Commander Adlain was on his feet
instantly.</p>

<p>'What's this?' Quettil asked.</p>

<p>'What did he say?' Walen said.</p>

<p>'Where?' Adlain demanded from the youth.</p>

<p>'Sir, in the questioning chamber of Master Nolieti, sir.'</p>

<p>Duke Quettil gave a small, high laugh. 'Why, is that
unusual?'</p>

<p>'Who is murdered, boy?' Adlain said, walking down the path
towards the servant.</p>

<p>'Sir, Master Nolieti, sir.'</p>

<h3 class="chapter">10. THE BODYGUARD</h3>

<p>'Once upon a time there was a land called Lavishia, and two
cousins lived there, called Sechroom and Hiliti.'</p>

<p>'I think you have already told this story, DeWar,' Lattens said
in a small, croaky voice.</p>

<p>'I know, but there is more to it. Some people's lives have more
than one story. This is a different one.'</p>

<p>'Oh.'</p>

<p>'How are you feeling? Are you well enough to hear one of my
stories? I know they are not very good.'</p>

<p>'I am well enough, Mr DeWar.'</p>

<p>DeWar plumped the boy's cushions up and got him to drink a
little water. He was in a small but luxurious room off the private
apartments, near the harem so that concubines like Perrund and
Huesse could come and sit with him, but close to his father's
quarters and that of Doctor BreDelle, who had pronounced the boy
prone to nervous exhaustion and pressure of blood on the brain, and
was bleeding him twice a day. There had been no return of the fits
the boy had suffered that first day, but he was recovering his
strength only very slowly.</p>

<p>DeWar came to see the boy when he could, which was usually when
Lattens' father was visiting the harem, as now.</p>

<p>'Well, if you are sure.'</p>

<p>'I am. Please tell your story.'</p>

<p>'Very well. One day the two friends were playing a game.'</p>

<p>'What sort of a game?'</p>

<p>'A very complicated one. Fortunately we don't need to concern
ourselves with the details of how the game is played. All that
matters is that they were playing it and they came to disagree
about the rules, because there were more than one set of rules
regarding how the game should be played.'</p>

<p>'That is strange.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but it was just that sort of game. So they disagreed. What
it boiled down to was that Sechroom said that &mdash; as in life in
general &mdash; you should always do what seemed like the right thing to
do at the time, while Hiliti said that sometimes you had to do what
appeared to be the wrong thing at the time in order to do the right
thing eventually. Do you see?'</p>

<p>'I'm not sure.'</p>

<p>'Hmm. Let me see. I know. That little pet eltar of yours. What's
it called?'</p>

<p>'What, Wintle?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Wintle. Remember when you brought it inside and it peed in
a corner?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Lattens said.</p>

<p>'And we had to take it and rub its nose in its own mess so that
it wouldn't do it again?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Well, that wasn't very nice for poor little Wintle, now was
it?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Can you imagine if somebody did that to you when you were
young, if you'd done a pee in the corner?'</p>

<p>'Eurgh!'</p>

<p>'But it was the right thing to do, because eventually Wintle
will stop doing that when he's brought inside, and so he can be
brought in and enjoy himself with us instead of having to stay in
the cage in the garden all the time.'</p>

<p>'Yes?'</p>

<p>'And that is the sort of thing that people mean when they talk
about being cruel to be kind. Have you heard that phrase
before?'</p>

<p>'Yes. My teacher says it often.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I think it is a phrase adults say to children quite often.
But that was what Sechroom and Hiliti disagreed about. Sechroom
said that you should never be cruel to be kind. Sechroom thought
there must always be another way of teaching people lessons, and
that good people had a duty to try and find those ways, and then to
use them. Hiliti thought this was silly, and that throughout
history it had been proved that sometimes you did have to be cruel
to be kind, whether what you were trying to teach was a little pet
eltar or a whole people.'</p>

<p>'A whole people?'</p>

<p>'You know. Like an Empire or a country. Like Tassasen.
Everybody.'</p>

<p>'Oh.'</p>

<p>'So, one day after they had fallen out over this game, Hiliti
decided that he would teach Sechroom a lesson. He and Sechroom had
grown up playing tricks and pranks on each other and each had come
to expect such behaviour from the other. This day, a short time
after their disagreement over the game, Hiliti and Sechroom and two
other friends rode on their great mounts to one of their favourite
places, a&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Was this before or after the other story, when the lady Leeril
gave Hiliti sweets?'</p>

<p>'This was afterwards. The four of them came to this place in the
hills where there was a clearing and a tall waterfall and lots of
fruit trees all around and lots of rocks&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Were any of the rocks sugar rocks?' .</p>

<p>'Lots of them. In many different flavours, though Sechroom and
Hiliti and their two friends had brought their own picnic. So they
ate the picnic and they swam in the pool at the foot of the
waterfall and they played some games of hide-and-seek and so on and
then Hiliti said he had a special game he wanted to show
Sechroom. Hiliti asked the other two friends to remain where they were by
the side of the pool, while Hiliti and Sechroom climbed up the
rocks until they were at the top of the waterfall, standing right
beside where the waters fell over the edge.</p>

<p>'Now, Sechroom didn't know, but Hiliti had ridden up there the
day before and hidden a wooden plank by the side of the
waterfall.</p>

<p>'Hiliti brought this plank out of the bushes and said that
Sechroom had to stand on the end of the plank, with the other end
sticking out over the drop. Then Hiliti would walk out on to the
plank, towards the end, but &mdash; and this was where Sechroom started
to get a little frightened &mdash; Hiliti would put on a blindfold first,
so that he couldn't see what he was doing. Sechroom would have to
guide him, and the thing was to see how close to the end of the
plank Sechroom would let him get. How much did they really trust
each other? That was the question.</p>

<p>'Then, assuming that Hiliti didn't fall off the plank and tumble
to his death on the rocks below, or, if he was lucky, miss the
rocks but land in the pool, it would be Sechroom's turn, and she
would have to do the same thing, with Hiliti standing on the end of
the plank and telling Sechroom to go forward or stop. Sechroom
wasn't very sure about any of this, but eventually agreed because
she didn't want to seem lacking in trust. Anyway, Hiliti put the
blindfold on, told Sechroom to adjust the length of the plank
hanging over the drop until she was happy with it, then he stepped
on to the plank and went shuffling and wobbling along towards the
end, with his hands and arms out-stretched. Like this.'</p>

<p>'Did he fall off?'</p>

<p>'No, he didn't. Sechroom told him to stop when he got right to
the very end of the plank and Hiliti could feel the edge. Hiliti
undid the blindfold and stood there, arms out, waving at the two
girls sitting far below. They were cheering and waving. Hiliti
turned carefully and went back to the safety of the cliff edge, and
then it was Sechroom's turn.</p>

<p>'Sechroom put on the blindfold and heard Hiliti adjust the
amount the plank stretched out over the drop. Then she stepped on
to it, sliding her feet very slowly and carefully and keeping her
arms out to each side just as Hiliti had done.'</p>

<p>'Like this.'</p>

<p>'Like that. Well, the plank went up and down and Sechroom felt
very frightened. A breeze had started up and it blew against
Sechroom and made her feel even more frightened, but she kept
sliding her feet along towards the end of the plank, which by now
was starting to seem very far away.</p>

<p>'Just as she got to the end, Hiliti told her to stop, and she
did. Then she slowly put her hands to the back of her head and
undid the blindfold.'</p>

<p>'Like this.'</p>

<p>'Like that. She waved down to the friends standing on the
grass.'</p>

<p>'Like this.'</p>

<p>'Like that, then she turned round to walk back along the plank,
just as Hiliti stepped off the plank and let it and Sechroom
fall.'</p>

<p>'No!'</p>

<p>'Yes! Now the plank didn't fall very far because Hiliti had tied
a length of rope to the end, but Sechroom fell screaming into the
pool at the foot of the waterfall and hit the water with a
tremendous splash and disappeared. Their two friends dashed and
splashed into the water to help, while Hiliti calmly drew the plank
back up and then knelt on the side of the cliff, looking down,
waiting for Sechroom to surface.</p>

<p>'But Sechroom did not surface. The two other friends swam around
looking for her and diving down into the depths of the pool and
searching amongst the rocks all jumbled at the sides of the pool
but they could find no sign of Sechroom. Up on the cliff Hiliti was
horrified at what he'd done. He had only meant to teach Sechroom a
lesson, to show her that you could not trust anybody. He wanted to
be cruel to be kind because he thought that Sechroom's ideas might
be the death of her one day if she was not taught to be more
careful, but now it looked like his &mdash; Hiliti's &mdash; ideas had been the
death of his cousin and best friend, for much time had passed by
then and Sechroom could not possibly have survived so long under
water.'</p>

<p>'Did Hiliti dive into the water too?'</p>

<p>'Yes! He dived into the pool and hit the water so hard that he
knocked himself out, but the two other friends rescued him and
brought him back to the grass by the side of the pool. They were
still slapping his cheeks and trying to press water out of his
lungs when Sechroom appeared from the water, her head and neck all
bloody and stumbled up to see how her friend was.'</p>

<p>'She was alive!'</p>

<p>'She had struck her head on an underwater rock when she'd fallen
into the pool and had nearly drowned, but she'd been brought up to
the surface behind the waterfall and floated along with the current
until she'd wedged between some rocks. There she had recovered and
had realised what Hiliti had been up to. She was angry with Hiliti
and with the two other friends as well, because she thought &mdash;
mistakenly &mdash; that they were in on the trick too, and so she hadn't
shouted out when the two had swum nearby, and had ducked under the
water so that they wouldn't see her. Only when she thought Hiliti
had injured himself too did she swim and wade out of the pool.'</p>

<p>'Did Sechroom forgive Hiliti?'</p>

<p>'Mostly, though the two were never quite so close friends
again.'</p>

<p>'But they were both all right?'</p>

<p>'Hiliti came to quickly and was mightily relieved to see his
friend. Sechroom's head wound was not as bad as it looked, though
to this day she bears a funny, triangular scar on her head where
the rock hit, just here, above the left ear. Luckily her hair
covers the scar.'</p>

<p>'Hiliti was bad.'</p>

<p>'Hiliti was trying to prove a point. People often behave badly
when they are trying to prove a point. Of course, he claimed that
he <em>had</em> proved it. He said that he had taught Sechroom
exactly the lesson he had sought to teach her, and taught it so
well that Sechroom put the results of that lesson into effect
almost instantly, for what was Sechroom doing, hiding there amongst
the rocks behind the waterfall, but trying to teach Hiliti a
lesson?'</p>

<p>'Ah-ha.'</p>

<p>'Ah-ha indeed.'</p>

<p>'So Hiliti was right?'</p>

<p>'Sechroom would never agree to that. Sechroom held that her head
was damaged and her brains were addled at the time and that that
proved <em>her</em> point, which had become that it was only
damaged people with confused brains who ever saw the justice in
trying to be cruel to be kind.'</p>

<p>'Mmm.' Lattens yawned. 'That was a better story than the last
one, but quite a difficult one.'</p>

<p>'I think you must rest now. You have to get better, don't
you?'</p>

<p>'Like Sechroom and Hiliti did.'</p>

<p>'That's right. They got better.' DeWar tucked the boy in as
Lattens' eyes slowly closed. The boy reached out and felt for
something. His hand closed on a square of worn, pale yellow
material, which he gripped tightly in one small hand and brought up
to hold by his cheek, settling his head further down into the
pillow with a few small nestling movements.</p>

<p>DeWar got up and made for the door, nodding to the nurse sitting
knitting by the window.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The General met his bodyguard in the visiting chamber of the
outer harem. 'Ah, DeWar,' UrLeyn said, walking swiftly from the
doors to the harem and settling his long jacket over his shoulders.
'Did you see Lattens?'</p>

<p>'I did, sir,' DeWar said, falling into step as they exited the
harem. Two men of the palace guard who had been effectively
tripling the guard on the harem entrance trailed them by a few
steps. This additional escort for the Protector was DeWar's
response to the increased danger he perceived UrLeyn to be in after
the attack by the Sea Company ambassador and the start of the war
in Ladenscion, which had begun a few days earlier.</p>

<p>'He was asleep when I looked in,' UrLeyn said. 'I'll see him
later. How was he?'</p>

<p>'Still recovering. I think the doctor bleeds him too much.'</p>

<p>'Now, DeWar, each to his own. BreDelle knows what he's doing. I
dare say you would not appreciate him trying to teach you the finer
points of sword-play.'</p>

<p>'Indeed not, sir, but even so.' DeWar looked awkward for a
moment. 'There is something I'd like to do, sir.'</p>


<p>'Yes? What?'</p>


<p>'I'd like to have Lattens' food and drink tasted. Just to make
sure that he is not being poisoned.'</p>

<p>UrLeyn stopped and looked at his bodyguard. 'Poisoned?'</p>

<p>'Purely as a precaution, sir. I'm sure he has some . . . normal
illness, trivial enough, But just to be on the safe side. With your
permission.'</p>

<p>UrLeyn shrugged. 'Very well, if you think it necessary. I dare
say my tasters won't object to the odd extra bit of food.' He set
off again, striding quickly.</p>

<p>They exited the harem and set off up the steps to the rest of
the palace two at a time until UrLeyn stopped about halfway up and
then continued one step at a time. He rubbed his lower back.
'Occasionally my body chooses to remind me of my true age,' he
said. He grinned and tapped DeWar on the elbow. 'I believe I
deprived you of your opponent, DeWar.'</p>


<p>'My opponent, sir?'</p>

<p>'Your game-playing companion.' He winked. 'Perrund.'</p>


<p>'Ah.'</p>

<p>'I tell you, DeWar, these young things are all very well, but
you realise they're still girls when you have a real woman.' He put
his hand to his back again. 'Providence, though. She puts me
through my paces, I tell you.' He laughed and stretched his arms.
'If ever I expire in the harem, DeWar, Perrund may be to blame, and
yet no blame will attach.'</p>


<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>


<p>They approached the King's Chamber where UrLeyn had taken to
holding his daily briefings on the war. A buzz of conversation
could be heard from beyond the guarded double doors. UrLeyn turned
to DeWar. 'Right, DeWar. I shall be in here for the next couple of
bells.'</p>

<p>DeWar looked at the doors with a pained expression, as a small
boy with no coin might look at a sweet shop counter. 'I really do
think I ought to be with you during these briefings, sir.'</p>

<p>'Now, DeWar,' UrLeyn said, taking hold of his elbow. 'I shall be
safe with my military men, and there will be a double guard on the
doors here.'</p>

<p>'Sir, leaders who have been assassinated have usually believed
that they were safe until the instant before it happened.'</p>

<p>'DeWar,' UrLeyn said kindly. 'I can trust all these men with my
life. I have known almost all of them for most of it. Certainly I
have known most of them for longer than I have known you. I can
trust them.'</p>


<p>'But, sir&mdash;'</p>


<p>'And you make some of them uncomfortable, DeWar,' UrLeyn said,
with a hint of impatience. 'They think a bodyguard should not be so
opinionated as you have been. And your mere presence suffices to
unsettle some of them. They think there's an extra shadow in the
room.'</p>


<p>'I shall dress in motley, put on the uniform of a fool&mdash;'</p>


<p>'You will not,' UrLeyn told him, and put his hand on the other
man's shoulder. 'I order you to amuse yourself as you see fit for
the next two bells and then return here and resume your duties
after my generals have told me how many more towns we've taken
since yesterday.' He clapped DeWar's shoulder. 'Now be gone. And if
I'm not here when you come back I shall have returned to the harem
for another bout with your opponent.' He grinned at the other man
and squeezed his arm. 'All this talk of war and victorious battles
seems to put a young man's blood in my cock!'</p>

<p>He left DeWar standing there, staring at the tiled floor of the
corridor while the doors opened and closed on the sound of talking
men. The two palace guards joined their comrades on either side of
the doors.</p>

<p>DeWar's jaw worked as though he was chewing on something, then
he spun and walked quickly away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plasterer had almost finished the remedial work on the
Painted Chamber. A final layer was drying and he was kneeling on
his white-spotted sheet surveying his tools and buckets and trying
to remember the correct order to put them away. This was a job
normally done by his apprentice, but he had had to do it himself
on this job because it was all so secret.</p>

<p>The chamber's door was unlocked and the black-clad figure of
DeWar, the Protector's bodyguard, walked in. The plasterer felt a
chill go through him when he saw the look on the tall man's dark
face. Providence, they didn't intend to kill him now he'd done his
job, did they? He'd known it was secret &mdash; what he had plastered up
was a hidden alcove for someone to spy on people, that was obvious
 &mdash; but could it be so secret they'd kill him afterwards to stop him
from talking? He'd done jobs in the palace before. He was honest
and he kept his mouth shut. They knew that. They knew him. One of
the palace guards was his brother. He could be trusted. He wouldn't
tell anyone about this. He'd swear to that on his children's lives.
They couldn't kill him. Could they?</p>

<p>He shrank back as DeWar approached. The bodyguard's sword wagged
from side to side in its black scabbard while the long dagger at
his other hip bounced in its own dark sheath. The plasterer looked
into the other man's face and saw only a blank, cold expression
that was more terrifying than a look of pitiless fury or an
assassin's lying smile. He tried to find his voice, but could not.
He felt his bowels start to loosen.</p>

<p>DeWar hardly seemed to see him. He glanced down at him, then at
the new plaster partition still drying between the other painted
panels, like a blood-drained lifeless face between living ones,
then he walked past, to the small dais. The plasterer, his mouth
dry, swivelled round where he knelt to watch. The bodyguard
clutched one arm of the small throne on the dais, then he went and
stood before a panel on the far side of the room which showed a
scene set within a harem, full of stylised images of languidly
buxom ladies in revealing dresses all lounging around, playing
games and sipping from tiny glasses.</p>

<p>The black figure stood there for a moment. When he spoke, the
plasterer jumped.</p>

<p>'Is the panel finished?' he asked. His voice was loud and
hollow-sounding in the bare room.</p>

<p>The plasterer swallowed, coughed dryly and eventually was able
to croak, 'Ye-ye-yes, yes, sir. Ready for the p-painter by
tomorrow.'</p>

<p>Still facing the painting of the harem, still with
hollow-sounding voice, the bodyguard said, 'Good.' Then without
warning, and with no back-swing, just a single startlingly sudden
thrust, he rammed his right fist straight through the panel he was
standing in front of.</p>

<p>On the other side of the chamber, the plasterer yelped.</p>

<p>DeWar stood there a moment longer, half his lower arm protruding
from the harem painting. A few painted plaster pieces fell dryly to
the floor as he slowly withdrew his arm again.</p>

<p>The plasterer trembled. He wanted to get up and run but he felt
glued to the spot. He wanted to raise his arms to defend himself
but they seemed pinned to his sides.</p>

<p>DeWar stood, looking down at his right forearm, slowly brushing
the white plaster dust off the black material. Then he spun on his
heel and walked quickly to the door, where he paused and looked
back with a face that seemed now to have taken on an expression of
inconsolable torment. He glanced at the panel he had just
punctured. 'You may find another panel which needs repair. It must
have been broken earlier, must it not?'</p>

<p>The plasterer nodded vigorously. 'Yes. Yes, oh yes, of course,
sir. Oh yes, very very definitely. I noticed it myself earlier,
sir. I'll attend to it immediately, sir.'</p>

<p>The bodyguard looked at him for a moment. 'Good. The guard will
let you out.'</p>

<p>Then he was gone, and the door closed and was locked.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="chapter">11. THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p>The Guard Commander of Yvenir palace held a scented kerchief to
his nose. Before him was a stone slab fitted with iron manacles,
leg-irons and hide straps. None of these was required to restrain
the current occupant of the slab, for spread upon it lay the limp
body of the King's chief torturer, Nolieti, naked save for a small
cloth draped over his genitals. Beside Guard Commander Polchiek
stood Ralinge, chief torturer to Duke Quettil, and a young,
grey-faced and sweating scribe sent by Guard Commander Adlain, who
had taken personal command of the hunting party seeking the
apprentice Unoure. These three were faced on the other side of the
slab by Doctor Vosill, her assistant (that is, myself) and Doctor
Skelim, personal physician to Duke Quettil.</p>

<p>The questioning chamber underneath the palace of Yvenir was
relatively small and low-ceilinged. It smelled of a variety of
unpleasant things, including Nolieti himself. It was not that the
body had started to decay &mdash; the murder had happened only a couple
of hours ago &mdash; but from the dirt and grime visible on the otherwise
pale skin of the dead chief torturer it was obvious that he had not
been the most personally hygienic of men. Guard Commander Polchiek
watched a flea crawl out from beneath the cloth over the man's
groin and start to travel up the slack curve of his stomach.</p>

<p>'Look,' Doctor Skelim said, pointing at the tiny black shape
moving over the mottled grey skin of the corpse. 'Somebody's
leaving the sinking ship.'</p>

<p>'Looking for warmth,' Doctor Vosill said, reaching quickly out
to the insect. It disappeared an instant before her hand got there,
jumping away. Polchiek looked amused, and I too wondered at the
Doctor's na&iuml;vet&eacute;. What was that proverb about there
being only so many ways to catch a flea? But then the Doctor's
fingers snapped closed in mid air, she inspected what she had
there, nipped their tips more tightly together and then brushed the
remains off on her hip. She looked up at Polchiek, whose face wore
a surprised expression. 'It might have jumped on one of us,' she
said.</p>

<p>A light-well above the slab had been opened for what was &mdash; to
judge from the amount of dust and debris that rained down upon the
unfortunate scribe sent to do the opening by Doctor Vosill &mdash; the
first time in a long time. A brace of floor-standing candelabra added their own light to
the gruesome scene.</p>

<p>'May we proceed?' the Guard Commander of Yvenir asked in a
rumbling voice. Polchiek was a big, tall man with a single great
scar from grey hair line to chin. A fall while hunting the previous
year had left him with a knee that could not bend. It was for this
reason that Adlain and not he was in charge of the search for
Unoure. 'I have never enjoyed attending any sort of event down
here.'</p>

<p>'I don't imagine the subjects of those events did either,'
Doctor Vosill observed.</p>

<p>'Nor did they deserve to,' Doctor Skelim said, one of his small
hands playing nervously with his collar ruff as his gaze flicked
round the barrel-vaulted walls and ceiling. 'It is a cramped,
oppressive sort of place, isn't it?' He glanced at the Guard
Commander.</p>

<p>Polchiek nodded. 'Nolieti used to complain that there was barely
room to swing a whip,' he said. The grey-faced scribe began to make
notes in a small slate-book. The fine point of the chalk made a
scratching, squeaking noise on the stone.</p>

<p>Skelim snorted. 'Well, he will swing no more of those. Is there
any word on Unoure, Guard Commander??</p>

<p>'We know which way he went,' Polchiek said. 'The hunting party
should pick him up before dark.'</p>

<p>'Do you think he will be in one piece?' asked Doctor Vosill.</p>

<p>'Adlain is not unused to hunting in these woods, and my hounds
are well trained. The youth may suffer a bite or two, but he'll be
alive when he is delivered to Master Ralinge here,' Polchiek said,
glancing at the wide little barrel of a man standing at his side
and staring with a sort of greedy fascination at the wound that had
gone most of the way towards separating Nolieti's head from his
shoulders. Ralinge looked slowly up at Polchiek when he heard his
name mentioned, and smiled, showing a full set of teeth which he
was proud to have removed from his victims and which he had used to
replace his own diseased items. Polchiek made a rumbling,
disapproving noise.</p>

<p>'Yes. Well, Unoure's fate is what concerns me here, gentlemen,'
Doctor Vosill said.</p>

<p>'Really, madam?' Polchiek said, keeping his kerchief at his
mouth and nose. 'What concern of yours is his fate?' He turned to
Ralinge. 'I believe his destiny now lies in the hands of those of
us on this side of the table, Doctor. Or does the lad have a
medical condition that may rob us of the chance to question him on
the matter?'</p>

<p>'Unoure is unlikely to have been the murderer,' the Doctor
said.</p>

<p>Doctor Skelim made a derisory snorting noise. Polchiek looked up
at the ceiling, which for him was not far away. Ralinge did not
take his gaze off the wound.</p>

<p>'Really, Doctor?' Polchiek said, sounding bored. 'And what
brings you to that strange conclusion?'</p>

<p>'The man is dead,' Skelim said angrily, waving one thin hand at
the corpse. 'Murdered in his own chamber. His assistant was seen
running into the woods while the body was still oozing blood. His
master used to beat him, and worse. Everybody knows that. Only a
woman would not see the obvious in this.'</p>

<p>'Oh, let the good lady doctor have her say,' Polchiek said. 'I
for one am already quite fascinated.'</p>

<p>'<em>Doctor</em>, indeed,' muttered Skelim, looking away to one side.</p>

<p>The Doctor ignored her colleague and bent over to grip the
ragged flaps of skin that had been Nolieti's neck. I found myself
swallowing hard. 'The wound was caused by a serrated instrument,
probably a large knife,' she said.</p>

<p>'Astonishing,' Skelim said sarcastically.</p>

<p>'There was a single cut, from left to right,' the Doctor said,
teasing apart the flaps of skin near the corpse's left ear. I
confess that her assistant was feeling a little queasy at this
juncture, though &mdash; like the torturer Ralinge &mdash; I could not tear my
gaze from the wound. 'It severed all the major blood vessels, the
larynx&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The what?' Skelim said.</p>

<p>'The larynx,' the Doctor said patiently, pointing to the roughly
slashed pipe inside Nolieti's neck. 'The upper part of the
wind-pipe.'</p>

<p>'We call it the upper part of the wind-pipe here,' Doctor Skelim
told her with a sneer. 'We have no need for foreign words. Quacks
and the like tend to use them when they're trying to impress people
with their spurious wisdom.'</p>

<p>'But if we look deeper,' the Doctor said, levering the corpse's
head right back and lifting its shoulders partly off the surface of
the slab. 'Oelph. Would you put that block underneath the shoulders
here?'</p>

<p>I picked a piece of wood shaped like a miniature executioner's
block up off the floor and stuck it under the dead man's shoulders.
I was feeling sick. 'Hold his hair, would you, Oelph?' the Doctor
said, forcing Nolietis head back still further. There was a
glutinous sucking noise as the wound opened further. I took hold of
Nolieti's sparse brown hair and looked away as I pulled on it.</p>

<p>'Looking deeper,' the Doctor repeated, seemingly quite
unaffected as she bent close over the tangle of multicoloured
tissues and tubes that had been Nolieti's throat, 'we can see that
the murder weapon cut so deep it nicked the victim's upper spinal
column, here, at the third cervical vertebra.'</p>

<p>Doctor Skelim snorted derisively again, but from the corner of
my eye I saw him leaning closer to the opened wound. A sudden
retching sound came from the far side of the table as Guard
Commander Adlain's scribe turned quickly away and doubled over by a
drain, his slate-book clattering to the ground. I felt my own bile
rising and tried to swallow it back.</p>

<p>'Here. Do you see? Lodged in the cartilage of the voice box. A
splinter of the vertebra, deposited there as the weapon was
withdrawn.'</p>

<p>'Very interesting, I'm sure,' Polchiek said. 'What is your
point?'</p>

<p>'The direction of the cut would indicate the murderer was
right-handed. Almost certainly the right hand was used, in any
event. The depth and penetration points to a person of considerable
strength, and incidentally reinforces the likelihood that the
murderer was using his favoured hand, for people are rarely able to
apply so much power so accurately and so certainly with their
non-favoured hand. Also the angle of the cut &mdash; the way the wound
slopes upward relative to the victim's throat &mdash; implies that the
murderer was a good head or so taller than the victim.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Providence!' Doctor Skelim said loudly. 'Why not rip out
his innards and read them like the priests of old to find the
murderer's name? I guarantee they will say "Unoure" in any event,
or whatever his name is.'</p>

<p>Doctor Vosill turned to Skelim. 'Don't you see? Unoure is
shorter than Nolieti, and left-handed. I imagine he is of average
strength, perhaps a little more, but he does not have the look of a
particularly powerful man.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps he was in a rage,' Polchiek suggested. 'People can
gather an inhuman strength in certain circumstances. I have heard
they do so particularly in a place like this.'</p>

<p>'And Nolieti might have been kneeling down at the time,' Doctor
Skelim pointed out.</p>

<p>'Or Unoure was standing on a stool,' Ralinge said in a voice
that was surprisingly soft and sibilant. He smiled.</p>

<p>The Doctor glanced towards a nearby wall. 'Nolieti was standing
at that workbench when he was attacked from behind. Arterial blood
sprayed the ceiling and venous blood fell directly on the bench
itself. He was not kneeling.'</p>

<p>The scribe completed his retching, picked up his fallen
slatebook and stood again, returning to his place by the table with
an apologetic look at Polchiek, who ignored him.</p>

<p>'Mistress?' I ventured.</p>

<p>'Yes, Oelph?'</p>

<p>'Might I let go his hair now?'</p>

<p>'Yes, of course, Oelph. I beg your pardon.'</p>

<p>'What does it matter exactly how Unoure did it?' Doctor Skelim
said. 'He must have been here when it happened. He ran away after
it had happened. Of course he did it.' Doctor Skelim looked
disgustedly at Doctor Vosill.</p>

<p>'The doors to the chamber were neither locked nor guarded,' the
Doctor pointed out. 'Unoure may have been on any sort of errand and
come back to find his master killed. As for&mdash;'</p>

<p>Doctor Skelim shook his head and held up one hand towards the
Doctor. 'These womanly fancies and this unhealthy attraction to
mutilation may represent a form of sickness in the mind on your
part, madam, but they have little to do with the business of
apprehending the culprit and getting the truth out of him.'</p>

<p>'The doctor is right,' Polchiek told the Doctor. 'It is clear
that you know your way around a corpse, madam, but you must accept
that I know mine around an act of villainy. Running is invariably a
sign of guilt, I have found.'</p>

<p>'Unoure may simply have been frightened,' the Doctor said. 'He
did not appear to be possessed of a great amount of wit. He may
simply have panicked, not thinking that running away was the most
suspicious thing he could have done.'</p>

<p>'Well, we shall shortly apprehend him,' Polchiek said with an
air of finality. 'And Ralinge here will find out the truth.'</p>

<p>When the Doctor spoke it was with a degree of venom I think all
of us found surprising. 'Will he, indeed,' she said.</p>

<p>Ralinge smiled broadly at the Doctor. Polchiek's scarred face
took on a look of some grimness. 'Yes, madam, he will,' he told
her. He flapped one hand at the corpse still lying between us.
'This has all been most diverting, I'm sure, but on the next
occasion you wish to impress some of your betters with your macabre
knowledge of human anatomy I would ask you not to include those of
us with better things to do, and certainly not me. Good day.'</p>

<p>Polchiek turned and left, ducking under the doorway and
acknowledging the salute of a guard. The scribe who had been sick
looked up hesitantly from his incomplete notes and appeared
uncertain what to do next.</p>

<p>'I agree,' Doctor Skelim said with a note of relish in his voice
as he brought his small face up towards the Doctor's. 'You might
have bewitched our good King for now, madam, but you do not
deceive me. If you have any regard for your own safety, you will
request leave to depart from us as quickly as possible and return
to whatever decadent regime raised you. Good day.'</p>

<p>The grey-faced scribe hesitated again, watching the Doctor's
impassive face as Skelim swept smartly out of the chamber, head
held high. Then the scribe muttered something to the still smiling
Ralinge, closed his slatebook with a snap and followed the small
doctor.</p>

<p>'They don't like you,' Duke Quettil's chief torturer said to the
Doctor. His smile broadened still further. 'I like you.'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked across the slab at him for a few moments, then
held up her hands and said, 'Oelph. A wet towel, if you
please.'</p>

<p>I ran and fetched a pitcher of water from a bench, picked a
towel from the Doctor's bag and soaked it, then watched her as she
washed her hands, not taking her gaze off the small, round man
across the slab from her. I handed her a dry towel. She dried her
hands.</p>

<p>Ralinge kept on smiling. 'You might think you hate what I am,
lady doctor,' he said softly. His voice sounded distorted by his
grisly collection of teeth. 'But I know how to give pleasure as
well as pain.'</p>

<p>The Doctor handed me the towel and said, 'Let us go, Oelph.' She
nodded at Ralinge and then we walked towards the door.</p>

<p>'And pain can be pleasure, too,' Ralinge called after us. I felt
my scalp crawl and the urge to be sick returned. The Doctor did not
react at all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'It's just a cold, sir.'</p>

<p>'Ha. Just a cold. I've known people die from colds.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, sir, but you should not. How is your ankle today? Let's
take a look at it, shall we?'</p>

<p>'I believe it is getting better. Will you change the
dressing?'</p>

<p>'Of course. Oelph, would you . . . ?'</p>

<p>I took the dressing and a few instruments from the Doctor's bag
and arranged them on a cloth on the King's huge bed. We were in the
King's private chamber, the day after Nolieti's murder.</p>

<p>The King's apartments at Yvenir are arranged within a splendid
domed cupola set high at the rear of the palace, upon what is the
roof to the main part of the great building. The gold-leaf-covered
dome is set back from the terraced edge of the roof and separated
from it by a small formal garden. As the roof level is just above
the height of the tallest trees on the ridge behind, marking the
summit of the hills on this side of the valley, the view from the
northfacing windows which bring light into the most spacious and
airy apartments is of nothing but sky beyond the clipped
geometrical perfections of the gardens and the white tusk
balustrade at their edge. This lends the apartments a strange,
enchanted air of detachment from the real world. I dare say the
clear mountain air contributes to this effect of isolated purity,
but there is something most especially about that lack of sight of
the mundane disorder of the landscape of men which gives the place
its singular spirit.</p>

<p>'Will I be well enough for the ball at the next small moon?' the
King asked the Doctor as he watched her prepare the new dressing
for his ankle. In truth the old dressing looked spotless, as the
King had taken to his bed with a tingly throat and sneezing fits
shortly after the news of Nolieti's demise had been communicated to
us in the Hidden Gardens the day before.</p>

<p>'I should imagine you will be able to attend, sir,' the Doctor
said. 'But do try not to sneeze over everybody.'</p>

<p>'I am the King, Vosill,' the King told her, sniffing into a
fresh handkerchief. 'I shall sneeze over whom I please.'</p>

<p>'Then you will spread the ill humour to others, they will
incubate it while you grow well again, they will perhaps
subsequently inadvertently sneeze in your presence and consequently
reinfect you, who will play host to it again while they recover,
and so on.'</p>

<p>'Don't lecture me, Doctor. I'm in no mood for it.' The King
looked round at the slumped pile of pillows propping him up, opened
his mouth to call a servant but then started to sneeze, his blond
locks bouncing as his head went back and forth. The Doctor stood up
from her chair and, while he was still sneezing, pulled the King
upright and rearranged his pillows. The King looked at her in some
surprise.</p>

<p>'You are stronger than you look, are you not, Doctor?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' the Doctor said with a modest smile as she went back
to undoing the dressing on the King's ankle. 'And yet still weaker
than I would be.' She was dressed as she had been the day before.
Her long red hair was more carefully prepared than was usual,
combed and plaited and hanging down her long dark jacket almost to
her slim waist. She looked at me and I became aware that I was
staring. I looked down at my feet.</p>

<p>Poking out from under the great bed's valance was a corner of
cream-coloured clothing that looked oddly familiar. I wondered at
this for a moment or two until, with a pang of jealousy for the
right of Kings, I realised it was part of a shepherdess's costume.
I pushed it further under the valance with my shoe.</p>

<p>The King settled himself back amongst his pillows. 'What is the
news on that boy who ran away? The one who killed my chief
questioner?'</p>

<p>'They caught him this morning,' the Doctor said, busying herself
with the old dressing. 'However, I do not think he committed the
murder.'</p>

<p>'Really?' the King said.</p>

<p>Personally, Master, I did not think he sounded as if he
particularly cared one way or the other what the Doctor thought on
this matter, but this was the cue for the Doctor to explain in some
detail &mdash; especially to a man, however exalted, who had a cold and
had just eaten a light breakfast &mdash; exactly why she had convinced
herself that Unoure had not killed Nolieti. I have to say that the
consensus amongst the other apprentices, assistants and pages,
arrived at in the kitchen parlour of the palace the previous
evening, was that the only perplexing aspect about the whole
business was how Unoure had been able to put off the dark deed for
so long.</p>

<p>'Well,' the King said, 'I dare say Quettil's fellow will get the
truth out of him.'</p>

<p>'The truth, sir? Or what is required to satisfy the prejudices
of those already convinced they know the truth?'</p>

<p>'What?' the King said, dabbing at his reddened nose.</p>

<p>'This barbaric custom of torture, sir. It produces not the truth
but rather whatever those commanding the questioner wish to hear,
for the agonies involved are so unbearable that those subject to
them will confess to anything &mdash; or more precisely, will confess to
what they think their tormentors wish them to confess to &mdash; in the
hope of causing the suffering to cease.'</p>

<p>The King looked at the Doctor with an expression of confusion
and disbelief. 'People are beasts, Vosill. Lying beasts. The only
way to get the truth out of them sometimes is to wring it from
them.' The King snorted mightily. 'My father taught me that.'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked at the King for a long moment, then started to
undo the old dressing. 'Indeed. Well, I'm sure he could not
possibly have been wrong, sir,' she said. She supported the King's
foot with one hand and unwound the white dressing with the other.
She started sniffing too.</p>

<p>The King kept on sniffing and snorting and staring at the
Doctor. 'Doctor Vosill?' he asked eventually as the last of the
dressing floated free from his ankle and the Doctor gave it to me
to put away.</p>

<p>'Sir?' she asked, wiping her eyes on her cuff and looking away
from Quience.</p>

<p>'Madam, have I upset you?'</p>

<p>'No,' the Doctor said quickly. 'No, sir.' She made as though to
start applying the new dressing, then put it aside and made an
exasperated clicking noise with her mouth. She busied herself with
the inspection of the small wound healing on the King's ankle and
then ordered me to fetch water and soap, which I had already
provided and set by the bed. She seemed annoyed that I had done
this, but quickly ensured the wound was clean, washed and dried the
King's foot and began to secure the new dressing.</p>

<p>The King appeared discomfited during all this. When the Doctor
was finished he looked at her and said, 'You will be looking
forward to the ball yourself, Doctor?'</p>

<p>She smiled briefly at him. 'Of course, your majesty.'</p>

<p>We packed our things away. As we were about to take our leave,
the King reached out and took the Doctor's hand. There was a
troubled, uncertain look I did not think I had seen before in his
eyes. He said, 'Women bear pain better than men, they say, Doctor.'
His eyes seemed to search hers. 'It is ourselves we hurt most when
we question.'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked down at her hand, held within the King's.
'Women bear pain better because we must give birth, sir,' she said
in a low voice. 'Such pain is generally regarded as being
unavoidable, but is alleviated to whatever extent it can be by
those of my calling.' She looked up into his eyes. 'And we only
become beasts &mdash; we become worse than beasts &mdash; when we torment
others, sir.'</p>

<p>She took her hand carefully from his, picked up her bag and with
a small bow to the King, turned and headed for the doors. I
hesitated, half expecting the King to call her back, but he did
not. He just sat there in his vast bed, looking hurt, and sniffing.
I bowed to the King and followed the Doctor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unoure never was put to the question. A few hours after he was
captured and brought back to the palace, while the Doctor and I
were attending the King and while Ralinge was still preparing the
chamber for his inquisition, a guard looked in on the cell where
the youth was being held. Somehow, Unoure had slit his own throat
with a small knife. His arms and legs were tightly chained behind
him and he had been stripped naked before being placed in the cell.
The knife had been wedged hilt-first into a crack in the stone
walls of the cell at about waist height. Unoure had been able to
kneel before it at the extremity of the reach the chains securing
him would allow and slice his neck across its blade, before
collapsing and bleeding to death.</p>

<p>I understand that the two Guard Commanders were furious. The
guards who had been charged with Unoure's custody were lucky they
were neither punished nor put to the question themselves. It was
eventually agreed that Unoure must have placed the knife there
before his attack on Nolieti, in case he was captured and brought
back to the palace.</p>

<p>Our shared station might dictate both that we knew little and
that our opinions were worth less, but none of us who had had
occasion to experience the full extent of Unoure's intelligence,
forethought and cunning found this explanation even remotely
convincing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quettil: Good Duke, how very pleasant it is to see you. Is this
not a fine view?</p>

<p>Walen: Hmm. I find you well, Quettil?</p>

<p>Q: In most rude health. You?</p>

<p>W: Tolerable.</p>

<p>Q: I thought you might want to sit down. See? I have arranged
for chairs.</p>

<p>W: Thank you, no. Let us go over here . . .</p>

<p>Q: Oh. Well, very well . . . Well, here we are. And afforded an
even finer view. However, I cannot imagine you wished to meet me up
here to admire my own estates.</p>

<p>W: Hmm.</p>

<p>Q: Allow me to hazard a guess. You have some misgivings about .
. . what was his name? Nolieti? Nolieti's death? Or rather about
his and his apprentice's?</p>

<p>W: No. I believe that matter is closed. I attach no great
significance to the death of a pair of torturers. Theirs is a
despicable if necessary craft.</p>

<p>Q: Despicable? Oh no. No indeed. Why, I would call it a form of
art at its most elevated. My man, Ralinge, is a veritable master. I
have only avoided singing his praises to Quience because I'm afraid
he might take him from me, and that would be most upsetting. I
should feel deprived.</p>

<p>W: No, my concern is with one whose profession is concerned with
the alleviation of pain, not the causing of it.</p>

<p>Q: Really? Ah, you mean that woman who calls herself a doctor?
Yes, what does the King see in her? Can't he just fuck her and have
done with it?</p>

<p>W: Perhaps he has, more likely he has not. She looks at him in a
way that leads me to believe she would like to be tumbled . . . but
I care not either way. The point is that he seems convinced of her
efficacy as a physician.</p>

<p>Q: And. . . what? There is someone you would rather see in her
place?</p>

<p>W: Yes. Anybody. I believe she is a spy, or a witch, or
something between the two.</p>

<p>Q: I see. Have you told the King?</p>

<p>W: Of course not.</p>

<p>Q: Ah-ha. Well, my own physician is of much the same opinion as
yourself, if that is any comfort. Which I warn you it ought not to
be, really, given that my physician is a self-important fool and no
better than any of the rest of these blood-letters and saw-bones at
curing anything.</p>

<p>W: Yes, quite. I am sure, nevertheless, that your physician is
as competent a doctor as can be found, and so I am glad that he
shares my opinion of the woman Vosill. That may well prove useful
if eventually we have to convince the King of her unsuitability. I
can tell you that Guard Commander Adlain feels that she is a threat
too, though he agrees with me that it is not yet possible to move
against her. That is why I wanted to talk to you. May I rely on
your discretion? I wish to speak of something that would have to be
done without the King's knowledge, even though it would be done
solely to protect him.</p>

<p>Q: Hmm? Yes, of course, good Duke. Go on. Nothing will go beyond
these walls. Well, balustrades.</p>

<p>W: I have your word?</p>

<p>Q: Of course, of course.</p>

<p>W: Adlain and I had an agreement with Nolieti that should it
prove necessary, the woman could be taken and put to the question .
. . without reference to the King.</p>

<p>Q: Ah, I see.</p>

<p>W: This plan was ready to be put into effect while we travelled
from Haspide to here. But now we are here, and Nolieti is dead. I
would ask you to be willing and ready to put a similar plan into
effect. If your fellow Ralinge is as efficient as you say then he
ought to have no difficulty extracting the truth from the
woman.</p>

<p>Q: Certainly, to date, I can think of no woman who has been able
to resist his advances in that respect.</p>

<p>W: Well then, will you let some part of the Palace Guard arrange
for her apprehension, or at least allow it to take place without
their interference?</p>

<p>Q: . . . I see. And what would be my interest in doing so?</p>

<p>W: Your interest? Why, the safety of the King, sir!</p>

<p>Q: Which is of course my first concern, as it is so clearly and
creditably yours, dear Duke. Yet without some obviously deleterious
action by the woman, it might rather look as though one was acting
on no more than your own dislike of her, however well informed.</p>

<p>W: My likes and dislikes are predicated entirely on what is good
for the royal house and I would hope that my service over the past
many years, indeed decades, has proved that. You care less than
nothing for the woman. Are you saying you would object?</p>

<p>Q: You have to see this from my stand-point, dear Walen. While
you are all here the responsibility for your safety is formally
mine. On this occasion, only a few days after the arrival of the
Court at Yvenir, one of its officers was killed unlawfully and his
murderer escaped the questioning and punishment that should
rightfully have been his. That displeased me greatly, sir, and it
was only because the matter was concluded almost as soon as it
began, and appeared to be entirely internal to the royal court that
I felt no more insulted. Even so, I think Polchiek does not realise
how close he came to being brought down a rung or two. And I might
add that my Guard Commander still worries that something is being
hidden, that the apprentice's death was somehow arranged by
somebody who might have benefited from his silence. But in any
event, if, after such a murder and suicide, a favourite of the King
were to disappear, then it would mean that I would have no choice
but to discipline Polchiek with the utmost severity. My honour
could be preserved by nothing less, and arguably would still
suffer. I would need the most decidedly persuasive proof that the
woman meant the King some harm before I could possibly countenance
any such action.</p>

<p>W: Hmm. I fancy the only proof you would accept would be the
King's corpse, and that alone might prove satisfactory to you.</p>

<p>Q: Duke Walen, I would hope that your wit might devise a way to
discover the woman's fraudulent nature long before that could
possibly occur.</p>

<p>W: Indeed. And I have just such a commission in hand.</p>

<p>Q: There, you see? And what is your plan?</p>

<p>W: Close to fruition, I hope.</p>

<p>Q: You will not tell me?</p>

<p>W: It is unfortunate that it seems neither of us can indulge the
other, Quettil.</p>

<p>Q: Yes, isn't it?</p>

<p>W: I have no more to say, I think.</p>

<p>Q: Very well. Oh, Duke?</p>

<p>W: Sir?</p>

<p>Q: I take it I can rely on the woman not still somehow
disappearing while the court rests at Yvenir, can I? If she did, I
might have to think most carefully about whether to reveal to the
King what you have revealed to me.</p>

<p>W: You gave me your word.</p>

<p>Q: Why, that I did, dear Walen. But I'm sure you would agree
that my first loyalty is to the King, not to you. If I judged that
the King was being deceived for no persuasive reason, it would be
my duty to inform him.</p>

<p>W: I am sorry I have troubled you, sir. It would appear that we
have both wasted our time this morning.</p>

<p>Q: Good day, Walen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This too I found later, not in the Doctor's journal but in some
other papers (and have edited it slightly to present a more
continuous narrative). The common participant of these two passages
is Walen, but &mdash; especially given all that happened later &mdash; I simply
do not know what to make of it. I record. I do not judge. I do not
even offer speculation.</p>

<h3 class="chapter">12. THE BODYGUARD</h3>

<p>The Royal Park of Croughen Hills had been a private game reserve
of the royal house of Tassasen for several centuries. UrLeyn had
parcelled large parts of it out to various of the nobles who had
supported his cause in the war of succession, but reserved the
right of the Protector and his court to go hunting in the
forests.</p>

<p>The four mounts and their riders circled the tall clump of brush
and tangled creeper bush where they reckoned their prey had gone to
ground.</p>

<p>RuLeuin took out his sword and leaned down from the saddle,
poking at the mass of vegetation. 'Are you sure he went in here,
brother?'</p>

<p>'Quite certain,' UrLeyn said, dipping his face towards his
mount's neck and squinting at an opening into the bushes. He
lowered himself still further, letting go of the reins with one
hand to peer into the undergrowth. DeWar, riding at his side,
reached out to hold the reins of UrLeyn's mount. RuLeuin, on the
far side of the bushes, also leant down upon the neck of his
mount.</p>

<p>'How is the boy today, UrLeyn?' YetAmidous said, voice booming.
His big face was red and bright with sweat.</p>

<p>'Oh, he's well,' UrLeyn said, levering himself upright again.
'Better with every day. Still not strong, though.' He glanced
round, looking back up the slope beneath the trees. 'We need some
beaters here . . .'</p>

<p>'Get your dark man to beat for us,' YetAmidous said to UrLeyn,
referring to DeWar, 'You'll get down and beat for us, won't you,
DeWar?'</p>

<p>DeWar smiled thinly. 'I only beat out human prey, General
YetAmidous.'</p>

<p>'Human prey, eh?' YetAmidous said with a hearty laugh. 'Those
were the days, what?' He slapped his saddle. DeWar's thin smile
lasted a little longer.</p>

<p>In the last years of the old Kingdom, when King Beddun had been
at his most carelessly cruel, prisoners &mdash; or poachers unlucky
enough to be caught plying their trade in the forest &mdash; had provided
most of the prey for hunts. That tradition of savagery had been
outlawed, but there was one memento of the time present, DeWar
thought, in the shape of the old King Beddun's antique hunting
crossbow, which UrLeyn carried slung over his back.</p>

<p>UrLeyn, DeWar, YetAmidous and RuLeuin had become separated from
the main part of the hunt, which could be heard on the far side of
the hill. 'Sound your horn, will you, Yet?' UrLeyn said. 'Let's get
some of the others here.'</p>

<p>'Right you are.' YetAmidous brought his horn to his lips and let
a great blare of sound escape. It almost coincided, DeWar noticed,
with the sound of horns coming from the other side of the hill, so
probably was not heard. He chose not to say anything. YetAmidous
shook some spit from the horn's mouthpiece and looked pleased with
himself.</p>

<p>'Is Ralboute joining us, Protector?' he asked. 'I thought he was
supposed to.'</p>

<p>'A message came this morning,' UrLeyn said, standing up in the
saddle to stare into the clump of bushes. He shielded his eyes as a
beam of sunlight fell across his face. 'He has been detained at &mdash;'
He looked at DeWar.</p>

<p>'I believe it is the city of Vynde, sir.'</p>

<p>'&mdash; Vynde. The city of Vynde is proving more resilient than
expected.'</p>

<p>RuLeuin stood in the saddle too and directed his gaze at the
same place as his brother. 'There was talk that we lost a couple of
the siege mortars,' he said.</p>

<p>'It is only a rumour as yet,' UrLeyn said. 'Simalg has rushed
ahead as usual and out-distanced his supporting forces.
Communication has been erratic. With Simalg, you never know. He may
have advanced too fast for his guns, or otherwise misplaced them.
Let's not assume the worst.'</p>

<p>'I have heard other grumbles, still, Protector,' YetAmidous
said, undoing the top of a wineskin and taking a quick gulp.
'Perhaps we should go to Ladenscion ourselves and take matters in
hand.' YetAmidous' brows compressed. 'I tell you, Protector, I <em>miss</em>
making war. And I'd warrant you for one would not misplace siege
guns.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' RuLeuin said. 'You ought to take charge of the war
yourself, brother.'</p>

<p>'I have thought about it,' UrLeyn said. He unsheathed his own
sword and whacked at the tops of some bushes. 'I have been
concerned to appear less of a warlord and more of a statesman, and
anyway did not reckon the rebellion in Ladenscion merited the full
weight of our forces, but I may change my mind if I think the
situation demands it. I shall wait for Ralboute's return, or for a
message from him. Yet, blow that horn again, would you? I don't
think they heard the first time.' UrLeyn put away his sword and
took off his green hunting cap. He wiped his brow.</p>

<p>'Ha!' YetAmidous said. He lifted the hunting horn, took a
gargantuan breath that raised his formidable body off the saddle of
his mount and turned his expression into a deep frown, then put the
instrument to his lips and blew with all his might, his face going
scarlet with the effort.</p>

<p>The note was fit to split ears. Almost immediately there was a
rustle and a commotion on the down-slope side of the clump of
bushes. DeWar was closest. He caught a glimpse of a big, thick-set,
grey-brown shape dart away at a furious pace towards another
conglomeration of vegetation.</p>

<p>'Ha!' YetAmidous bellowed. 'Flushed the fucker!'</p>

<p>'DeWar!' UrLeyn shouted. 'Did you see him?'</p>

<p>'There, sir.'</p>

<p>'Ru! Yet! This way!' UrLeyn wheeled his mount and charged off in
the same direction.</p>

<p>DeWar preferred to ride right at UrLeyn's side whenever he
could, but in the dense thickets of the Park woods it was often
impossible, and he would have to follow the Protector's mount
through the undergrowth, over fallen tree trunks and under hanging
boughs as best he could, ducking and leaning and sometimes hanging
half out of the saddle to avoid the snagging branches.</p>

<p>Taking the direction that DeWar had indicated, UrLeyn set off at
a gallop down a shallow slope, his mount thundering along the hint
of path amongst the crowding bushes. DeWar followed, trying to keep
in view the bobbing green shape that was UrLeyn's cap.</p>

<p>The incline was covered by undergrowth and overhung
by the crisscrossed trunks of trees which had started to fall
but been caught by their healthier fellows. A confusion of lushly
green limbs and twisted branches made the going difficult. The
footing for the mounts was treacherous. The deep litter of rotting
leaves, twigs, fruits and seed cases could hide a multitude of
holes, burrow entrances, rocks and partially decayed logs, any one
of which could break a mount's leg or trip it and bring it tumbling
to the ground.</p>

<p>UrLeyn was going too fast. DeWar was never so fearful far his
own life or for his master's than when he tried to keep up with him
on some mad dash during a hunt. He did his best, all the same,
attempting to steer his mount down the trail of broken branches and
trampled litter that UrLeyn had taken. Behind him, he could hear
the mounts of YetAmidous and RuLeuin also crashing in pursuit.</p>

<p>The animal they were hunting was an ort, a powerful, thickset
scavenger a third the size of a mount. They were usually regarded
as belligerent and stupid, but DeWar thought the reputation
undeserved. Orts ran until they were cornered and only then did
they fight, using their small sharp horns and their even sharper
teeth, and they tried to avoid the clear areas under the high
canopies where galloping was easy and the ground relatively free of
brush and other obstructions. Instead they made for places like
this, where a jumble of living and dead trees and their associated
debris made both observation and chase difficult.</p>

<p>The trail led down a steepening slope towards a stream. UrLeyn
whooped and shouted and disappeared further ahead. DeWar cursed and
urged his mount to go faster. It shook its head and snorted,
refusing. DeWar tried to stop himself watching where his mount was
putting its feet &mdash; best to leave that to the animal. He would be
better occupied ducking to avoid the overhanging boughs and
branches that threatened to knock him senseless or gouge out his
eyes. From far away he heard the sound of the rest of the hunt: men
shouting, horns blaring, hounds yapping, prey screaming. From the
noise, the others must have cornered a large group. The single
beast UrLeyn was chasing had succeeded in escaping without any
hounds in pursuit. It was a big animal, and hunting it without
hounds was a brave or foolish thing to do. DeWar took one hand
briefly off the reins and wiped his face with one sleeve. The day
was hot and the air under the great trees still and sticky. Sweat
still trickled down his face, stinging in his eyes and producing a
salty taste in his mouth.</p>

<p>Behind him, a sharp report was the noise of a gun going off.
Probably an ort being dispatched. Or a musketeer losing half his
face. Guns small enough to be carried by a man, or even on the back
of a mount, were unreliable, inaccurate and often more dangerous
for the firer than the fired-at. Gentlemen did not use them, and
crossbows were superior in most respects. Still, the smiths and
armourers laboured to produce better examples of muskets with each
passing season, and UrLeyn had used the weapons to good effect
against cavalry charges during the war of succession. DeWar worried
that one day within his lifetime guns would become reliable enough
 &mdash; and more importantly sufficiently accurate &mdash; to provide a
bodyguard with his worst nightmares, but for now that day still
seemed a fair way off.</p>

<p>A scream came from somewhere off to the left, down the small
valley of the stream. It might have been human or ort. It sent a
shiver through DeWar despite the heat.</p>

<p>He had lost sight of UrLeyn. Branches and leaves swayed and
thrashed ahead to his left. With a cold feeling in his guts DeWar
wondered if the scream he had heard had been from the Protector. He
swallowed hard, wiping his face again and attempting to wave away
insects buzzing angrily round his head. A branch caught him on the
face, stinging his right cheek. What if UrLeyn had fallen from his
mount? He might have been gored, or had his throat bitten out. Last
year, near here, one of the younger nobles had somersaulted off his
falling mount and been impaled through the back and belly on a
jagged remnant of tree trunk. His screams had sounded like that
scream, hadn't they?</p>

<p>He tried to urge his mount to go faster. A branch snagged on the
crossbow slung over his back, almost yanking him out of his saddle.
DeWar hauled on the reins and the animal below him shrieked as the
metal bit cut into its mouth. He twisted in the saddle and tried
unsuccessfully to untangle himself. Up slope, he could see RuLeuin
and YetAmidous approaching. He swore, pulled his dagger and hacked
at the offending branch. It parted from the tree, remaining lodged
in the crossbow but letting him go. He kicked his spurs into the
mount's side and it started off down the slope again.</p>

<p>He burst out of the undergrowth, down a suddenly steep earth
bank and into a clearing by the stream-side. UrLeyn's mount stood
riderless by a tree, panting. DeWar looked wildly around for the
Protector, then saw him standing a little way off, near where the
stream appeared from a jumble of fallen rocks, his crossbow at his
shoulder, aiming at the big ort, which was whining and squealing as
it tried to jump up the slippy, moss-covered rocks barring its way
up and out of the clearing.</p>

<p>The ort leapt halfway up the boulder slope, seemed to be about
to find further purchase on the rocks and complete its escape, then
with a grunt it lost its footing and fell, bouncing off a lower
rock and landing heavily on its back by the side of the stream. It
struggled to its feet, shaking itself. UrLeyn advanced a couple of
steps closer to the animal, crossbow aimed. DeWar unslung his own
bow as he dismounted. He wanted to shout to UrLeyn, to tell him to
get back on his mount and leave the animal to him, but he was
afraid of distracting the other man while the ort was so close. The
ort turned its attention away from the rocks. It growled at UrLeyn,
who was now five or six strides away. Its only way out now was past
the man.</p>

<p>Now, thought DeWar. Shoot. Loose. Fire. Now. He was another ten
or so strides behind UrLeyn. He took a few slow steps to the right,
along the bottom edge of the earth bank, widening the angle he
could see between UrLeyn and the ort. He tried to ready his own
crossbow for firing without looking at it, frightened to take his
eyes off the Protector and the prey he had cornered. Something was
stuck in the crossbow. He could feel it. The branch it had snagged
on earlier. His hand closed around leaves and twigs, trying to pull
them free. Failing.</p>

<p>Snarling, the ort backed away from the slowly advancing UrLeyn.
The animal's rump bumped into one of the mossy boulders it had
tried to scale. It angled its head downwards fractionally. Its
slightly curved horns were only just longer than a man's hand, but
each came to a point sharp enough to disembowel a mount. UrLeyn was
wearing a light hide jerkin and trousers. DeWar had suggested
heavier clothing or some chain mail in addition that morning,
before they had set off, but the Protector was having none of it.
The day was going to be too hot as it was.</p>

<p>The ort lowered its rear quarters. With a clarity which seemed
almost unnatural, DeWar could see the muscles in the ort's quarters
bunching, tensing. He pulled at the foliage stuck in his crossbow,
waggling it. The dagger. He might have to forget about the crossbow
and try throwing the dagger. It did not throw well, but it was the
only other choice he had. The branch started to tear free from the
crossbow.</p>

<p>'Brother?' a voice boomed out above him. DeWar whirled to see
RuLeuin high above him, his mount's front hooves near the edge of
the earth bank. UrLeyn's brother, his face caught in a stray beam
of sunlight, was shading his eyes with one hand and looking across
the clearing at the far bank. Then his gaze dropped to the clearing
and UrLeyn. 'Oh,' he said quietly.</p>

<p>DeWar looked quickly back. The ort had not moved. It was still
growling softly, still tensed. Saliva dripped from one edge of its
mouth. DeWar heard his mount give a single small whimper.</p>

<p>UrLeyn made a tiny movement, there was a barely heard click,
then the man seemed to freeze.</p>


<p>'Shit,' he said softly.</p>


<p>Crossbows could kill from hundreds of strides away. A quarrel
from one could pierce a metal breastplate, at close range. There
was rarely time to stop, tension and load a bow during the heat of
a hunt. One rode with the bow wound up and ready to fire, and many
kept it loaded, too. Crossbows hanging from saddles had shot more
than one hunter in the foot, or worse, and those over a man's back
could be even more deadly, if they snagged on a branch in a
thicket. And so a hunting crossbow had a safety latch. One had to
remember to undo it before the weapon would fire. In the excitement
of the chase, it was not unusual for a hunter to forget to do so.
And UrLeyn's crossbow, which had been King Beddun's, was an old
one. The latch release had been added later, not designed in, and
was positioned badly, towards the rear of the weapon and so not
easy to slip. UrLeyn would have to move one hand from its position
to make the adjustment. The king UrLeyn had executed might have his
revenge from beyond the grave.</p>

<p>DeWar held his breath. The branch which had tangled in his own
bow fell to the ground. Still not taking his eyes off the ort,
DeWar watched UrLeyn slowly move one hand to the safety latch on
his crossbow. The weapon, its weight supported by one hand, shook.
The ort growled louder and shifted its position slightly,
side-stepping closer to the stream, narrowing DeWar's angle of fire
so much that one side of its head was now hidden by UrLeyn's body.
Above him, DeWar could hear RuLeuin's mount breathing. DeWar felt
for his bow's safety latch as he brought it up to his shoulder and
took another step to the right to open the angle again.</p>

<p>'What? What's this? Where . . . ?' another voice said from
above, to the accompaniment of swishing leaves and stamping hooves.
YetAmidous.</p>

<p>UrLeyn gently unclipped the safety on the crossbow and started
to move his hand back towards the trigger again. The ort
charged.</p>

<p>UrLeyn's crossbow started to drop, hinging down as the Protector
tried to track the animal racing towards him. He began to leap at
the same time, moving to the right, obscuring the clear shot DeWar
had had of the ort. DeWar released the trigger on the bow just in
time, an instant before the bolt would have flown towards the
Protector. Suddenly UrLeyn's hunting cap leaped from his head and
went tumbling away towards the stream. DeWar registered this
without thinking what had caused it. He started to run towards
UrLeyn, leaning forward, pushing off with one foot then the other,
holding the bow in front of his belly, pointing to one side. UrLeyn
was slipping, the foot he had put his weight on beginning to flick
out from underneath him.</p>

<p>Two steps, three. Something whirred past DeWar's head and left a
curl of wind to stroke his cheek. An instant later there was a
splash in the stream, the water kicking high into the air.</p>

<p>Four steps. Still picking up speed, each stride more like a
leap. The Protector's crossbow made a cracking, twanging noise. The
bow pushed back in UrLeyn's hands. The bolt appeared in the left
haunch of the charging ort, making the animal scream, leap into the
air and twist its hips, but when it landed again, two strides from
the stumbling, falling UrLeyn, it lowered its horned head and
charged straight at him.</p>

<p>Five, six steps. UrLeyn hit the ground. The ort's snout thudded
into his left hip. It reared back and darted forward again, head
lower this time, aiming for the fallen man's midriff as he started
to raise one hand in an attempt to fend the animal off.</p>

<p>Seven. DeWar brought the crossbow round as he ran, still at
waist height. He took a half-stride to steady it as best he could
then pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The quarrel hit the ort just above the left eye. The animal
quivered and stopped in its tracks. The feathered bolt protruded
from its skull like a third horn. DeWar was four then three steps
away, throwing the crossbow aside as his left hand crossed to his
right hip and the handle of the long dagger. UrLeyn kicked,
pivoting his lower body away from the ort, which was looking down
at the ground less than a pace away from him, snorting and shaking
its head while its front legs buckled and it settled to the
ground.</p>

<p>DeWar drew the dagger and leapt over UrLeyn as the older man
rolled away from the ort, landing between the two. The ort snorted
and puffed and shook its head and looked up with what DeWar would
always swear was a surprised expression as he plunged the dagger
into its neck near its left ear and in one swift movement opened
its throat to the air. The animal made a whooshing noise and
collapsed to the ground, head tucked in to its chest, its dark
blood spreading around it. DeWar kept the dagger pointing towards
it as he knelt there, feeling behind him with his free hand to make
sure where UrLeyn was.</p>

<p>'Are you all right, sir?' he asked, without looking round. The
ort jerked, seemed to be trying to get to its feet, then rolled
over on its side, legs trembling. The blood continued to gush from
its neck. Then the animal stopped shaking, the blood began to seep
rather than pulse, and slowly the beast's legs folded in to its
body as, finally, it died.</p>

<p>UrLeyn pulled himself up on to his knees by DeWar. He put one
hand on the other man's shoulder. The Protector's grip felt shaky.
'I am . . . chastened, I think would be the right word, DeWar.
Thank you. Providence. Big bugger, isn't he?'</p>

<p>'Big enough, sir,' DeWar said, deciding the motionless animal
was little enough of a threat to let him risk glancing behind, to
where YetAmidous and RuLeuin were making their way down a
shallow-sloped part of the earth bank. Their mounts stood on the
bank, looking down at UrLeyn and his own mount. The two men
approached at a run. YetAmidous still held his discharged crossbow.
DeWar looked back at the ort, then stood, sheathed the long dagger
and helped UrLeyn to his feet. The Protector's arm trembled and he
did not let go of DeWar's arm once he had stood up.</p>

<p>'Oh, sir!' YetAmidous cried, clutching his crossbow to his
chest. His broad, round face looked grey. 'Are you unharmed? I
thought I &mdash; Providence, I thought I'd . . .'</p>

<p>RuLeuin came dashing up, nearly tripping on DeWar's crossbow
where it lay on the ground. 'Brother!' He threw his arms wide and
almost knocked his brother over as he hugged him, pulling UrLeyn's
hand away from DeWar.</p>

<p>On the slope above, the sounds of the main part of the hunt were
coming closer.</p>

<p>DeWar glanced back at the ort. It looked very dead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'And who fired first?' Perrund asked quietly and without moving.
Her head was tipped, lowered over the 'Secret Keep' board, studying
her next move. They were sitting in the visiting chamber of the
harem, towards ninth bell. There had been a particularly noisy
after-hunt feast that evening, though UrLeyn had retired early.</p>

<p>'It was YetAmidous,' DeWar said, no more loudly. 'His was the
shot that lifted the Protector's cap off his head. The cap was
found downstream. The bolt was embedded inside a log by the stream.
A finger-breadth lower . . .'</p>

<p>'Indeed. And so it was RuLeuin's that just missed you.'</p>

<p>'And just missed UrLeyn, too, though I think it was his waist it
missed by a hand's breadth or so, not his head by a finger's.'</p>

<p>'Could each bolt plausibly have been meant for the ort?'</p>

<p>'. . . Yes. Neither man is regarded as a marksman. If YetAmidous
really was aiming for UrLeyn's head then I imagine that most of the
people in the court who consider themselves authorities on this
sort of matter would judge it as a surprisingly accurate shot,
given the circumstances. And YetAmidous did seem genuinely shocked
that he'd missed the Protector by so small a margin. And RuLeuin is
his brother, for all Providence.' DeWar sighed heavily, then yawned
and rubbed his eyes. 'And YetAmidous, as well as being a poor shot,
is just not the type to be an assassin.'</p>

<p>'Hmm,' Perrund said in a particular tone.</p>

<p>'What?' Only as he said this did DeWar realise how well he felt
he had come to know the woman. Just the way she had made that
single sound had meant much to him.</p>

<p>'I have a friend who spends quite a lot of time in YetAmidous'
company,' Perrund said softly. 'She has said that he delights in
card games played for money. He takes even greater delight in
making it seem that he is ignorant of the subtleties of the games
and pretending that he is a poor player. He appears to forget the
rules, has to ask what to do at certain points, inquires as to the
meaning of terms the other players use, and so on. Often he will
deliberately lose a series of small bets. In fact he is only
waiting until an especially large wager is at stake, whereupon he
almost invariably wins, much to his own apparent surprise. She has
seen this happen time after time. His friends are wise to him now,
and are amused as well as wary, but many a young and smirking
nobleman who thought himself in the presence of a bumbling fool
ripe for the picking has been lucky to leave YetAmidous' house with
a coin to call his own.'</p>

<p>DeWar realised that he was biting his lip as he stared
at the game board. 'So the man is a skilled dissembler, not a
buffoon. That is worrying.' He looked up at Perrund, though she did
not meet his gaze. He found himself inspecting the blonde mass of
her gathered-up hair, marvelling at its sheen and perfect fairness.
'Your friend would not have any further observations or opinions on
the gentleman, would she?'</p>

<p>Still not looking up, Perrund took a long deep breath. He
watched her shoulders in the red gown, glanced down to the swell of
material over her breasts. 'Once, perhaps twice,' she said, 'when
YetAmidous has been very drunk, she has thought he revealed . . . a
certain jealous contempt for the Protector. And I think he has
little regard for you.' She looked up suddenly.</p>

<p>DeWar felt himself rock back slightly, as though afflicted by
the force of the gaze from those blue-flecked gold eyes. 'Though
none of this is to say that he is not still a good and loyal
follower of the Protector,' Perrund said. 'If one is determined to
find fault then looking hard enough will produce reason to distrust
everybody.' She looked down again.</p>

<p>'Of course,' DeWar said, and felt his face grow warm. 'Still, I
would rather know such things than not.'</p>

<p>Perrund moved one piece, then another. 'There,' she said.</p>

<p>DeWar continued with his analysis of the game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="chapter">13. THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p>Master, the masked ball took place six days later. The King
still had a slight cold, but the Doctor had given hire a
preparation made from flowers and mountain herbs which dried up his
'membranes' (by which I think she meant his nose) for the duration
of the dance. She advised him to avoid alcohol and to drink copious
amounts of water, or better still fruit juice. However, I believe
that during the ball he was quickly persuaded, principally by
himself, that the definition of fruit juice might include wine and
so drank a deal of that during the ball.</p>

<p>The Grand Ballroom of Yvenage is a dramatic circular space half
of whose circumference is taken up with floor to ceiling windows.
In the year since the court had last visited Yvenir, the windows
had been refashioned throughout their lower quarter. The great
pastel-green plaster panels had been replaced with a grid of wood
holding smaller panes of thin, colourless glass. The glass was
almost crystal in its perfection, affording a barely distorted view
of the moonlit landscape of forested hills across the valley. The
effect was extraordinarily eye-catching and it seemed, from the
expressions of wonder I heard uttered and the extravagance of the
estimates made within my earshot concerning the cost of such a
project, that people could hardly have been more impressed had the
new windows been made of diamond.</p>

<p>The orchestra sat on a low circular stage set in the centre of
the room, each player facing inwards to watch their conductor, who
swivelled towards each section of the musicians in turn. The
dancers swirled round this focus like fallen leaves caught within a
spiralling wind, the intricate sets and patterns of the dances
providing an order within that apparent chaos.</p>

<p>The Doctor was one of the more striking women present. Partly
the effect was achieved through her height. There were taller women
there, yet still she seemed to shine out amongst them. She
possessed a bearing that was in all senses naturally elevated. She
wore a gown that was plain by comparison with most. It was a dark
and lustrous green, to set off the wide, netted fan of her
carefully arrayed red hair. Her gown was unfashionably narrow.</p>

<p>Master, I confess I felt excited and honoured to be there. The
Doctor having no other escort, it fell to me to accompany her to
the ball, and so I was able to think with some pleasure of my
fellow apprentices and assistants, most of whom were banished
downstairs. Only the senior pages were permitted to attend, and the
few of those not expected to act purely as servants were all too
aware of their inability to shine in a company containing so many
junior noblemen. The Doctor, in contrast, treated me as her equal,
and made not one demand on me as an apprentice the whole ball
long.</p>

<p>The mask I had chosen was a plain one of flesh-coloured paper
painted so that one half looked happy, with a big smile at the lips
and a raised brow, while the other side looked sad, with downcast
mouth and a small tear at the eye. The Doctor's was a half-face
made of light, highly polished silver treated with some sort of
lacquer. It was, I thought, the best and perhaps the most
disconcerting mask that I saw all that night, for it reflected the
observer's gaze right back at them and so disguised the wearer &mdash;
for whatever that was worth, given the Doctor's unmistakable form &mdash;
better than the most cunning creation of feathers, filigreed gold
or sparkling gems.</p>

<p>Beneath the mirror-like mask, the Doctor's lips looked full and
tender. She had coloured them with the red oil-cream that many of
the ladies at court use for such occasions. I had never seen her
adorn herself so before. How moist and succulent that mouth
looked!</p>

<p>We sat at a great table in one of the ballroom's anterooms,
surrounded by fine ladies of the court and their escorts and looked
down upon by huge paintings of nobles, their animals and estates.
Servants with drinks trays circulated everywhere. I couldn't recall
having seen a ball so well staffed before, though it did seem to me
that some of the servants looked a bit rough and ready, handling
their trays with a degree of awkwardness. The Doctor did not choose
to stay in the ballroom itself between dances and seemed reluctant
to take part at all. I formed the impression she was only there
because the King expected her to be, and while she might have
enjoyed the dances, she was afraid of making some error of
etiquette.</p>

<p>I myself also felt nervous as well as excited. Such grand balls
are opportunities for much pomp and ceremony, attracting from all
around scores of great families, Dukes and Duchesses, rulers of
allied principalities and their entourages and generally producing
a kind of concentration of people of power and circumstance one
sees seldom enough even in the capital. Little wonder that these
are occasions when allegiances, plans, alliances and enmities are
formed, both on the political and national scale of things and at
the personal level.</p>

<p>It was impossible not to feel affected by the urgency and
momentousness of the atmosphere and my poor emotions felt tattered
and frazzled before the ball was properly begun.</p>

<p>At least we ought to remain safely on the periphery. With so
many Princes, Dukes, Barons, Ambassadors and the like demanding his
time &mdash; many of whom he would not see from one year to the next,
save for this single event &mdash; the King was unlikely to concern
himself with the Doctor and myself, who were at his beck and call
during every day of the year.</p>

<p>I sat there, immersed in the hum of conversation and listening
to the distant sound of a dance tune, and I wondered what plots and
schemes were being hatched, what promises and enemies were
being made, what desires stoked, what hopes squashed.</p>

<p>A group of people were passing us, heading for the ballroom. The
small figure of a man at their head turned towards us. His mask was
an old one made of blue-black feathers. 'Ah, the lady doctor,
unless I am grievously mistaken,' came the harsh, cracked voice of
Duke Walen. He stopped. His wife &mdash; his second, much younger than he,
and small and voluptuous &mdash; hung on his arm, her golden mask dripping
with gems. Various junior members of the Walen family and their
retainers arranged themselves in a half-circle around us. I stood,
as did the Doctor.</p>

<p>'Duke Walen, I assume,' she said, bowing carefully. 'How are
you?'</p>

<p>'Very well. I would ask you how you are, however I assume that
physicians look after themselves better than anybody else, so I
shall ask how you think the King is. How is he?' The Duke seemed to
be slurring his words.</p>

<p>'The King is generally well. His ankle still needs treatment and
he has the remains of a slight&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Good, good.' Walen looked round at the doors leading into the
ballroom. 'And how do you like our ball?'</p>

<p>'It is most impressive.'</p>

<p>'Tell me. Do they have balls in this place Drezen, where you
come from?'</p>

<p>'They do, sir.'</p>

<p>'And are they as fine as this? Or are they better and more
glorious and put our sad and feeble efforts into the shade? Does
Drezen entirely out-do us in every matter as it does, by your
claims, in medicine?'</p>

<p>'I think the dances we hold in Drezen are rather less splendid
than this, sir.'</p>

<p>'Are they? But how can this be? I had become quite convinced
through your many comments and observations that your homeland was
in advance of ours in every respect. Why, you talked of it in such
glowing terms that sometimes I thought you were describing a
fairy-tale land!'</p>

<p>'I think the Duke will find that Drezen is quite as real as
Haspidus.'</p>

<p>'Faith! I am almost disappointed. Well, there we are.' He turned
to go, then stopped again. 'We shall see you dancing later, shan't
we?'</p>

<p>'I imagine so, sir.'</p>

<p>'And will you perhaps undertake to demonstrate for us a dance
from Drezen, and teach it to us?'</p>

<p>'A dance, sir?'</p>

<p>'Yes. I cannot imagine that Drezeners share all our dances and
possess none that we would not recognise. That is not feasible,
surely?' The Duke's small, slightly hunched figure turned jerkily
from one side to the other, seeking endorsement.</p>

<p>'Oh yes,' his wife purred from behind her gold and gem-stone
mask. 'I should think that in Drezen they have the most advanced
and interesting dances.'</p>

<p>'I regret that I am no dance instructor,' the Doctor said. 'I
wish now that I had been more assiduous in learning how to comport
myself at a ball. Sadly, my youth was spent in more academic
circles. It is only since I have had the good fortune to arrive in
Haspidus that I&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But no!' the Duke cried. 'My dear woman, you cannot be claiming
that there is some aspect of civilised behaviour in which you have
nothing to teach us! Why, this is unheard of! Oh, my dear lady, my
faith is shaken. I beg you to reconsider. Search your doctorly
memories! At least attempt to drag up for us some recollection of a
physician's cotillion, a surgeon's ballet, at the very least a
nurses' horn-pipe or a patients' jig.'</p>

<p>The Doctor appeared unruffled. If she was sweating behind her
mask, as I was behind mine, she gave no sign of it. In a calm and
even voice she said, 'The Duke flatters me in his estimation of the
breadth of my knowledge. I shall of course obey his instruction but
I&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I'm sure you can, I'm sure,' the Duke said. 'And pray, what
part of Drezen was it you said that you are from?'</p>

<p>The Doctor drew herself up a little more. 'From Pressel, on the
island of Napthilia, sir.'</p>

<p>'Ah yes, yes. Napthilia. Napthilia. Indeed. You must miss it
terribly, I imagine.'</p>


<p>'A little, sir.'</p>


<p>'Having no one of your own kind to talk to in your native
language, unable to catch up on the latest news, lacking
compatriots to reminisce with. A sad business, being an exile.'</p>


<p>'It has its compensations, sir.'</p>


<p>'Yes. Good. Very well. Think on, about those dances. We shall.
see you later, perhaps, high-kicking, whirling and whooping,
eh?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' the Doctor said. I for one was glad I could not see
her expression behind the mask. Of course, being a half-face mask,
her lips were visible. I began to worry how much aspersion a pair
of full red lips could convey.</p>


<p>'Just so,' Walen said. 'Until then, madam.' He nodded.</p>


<p>The Doctor bowed subtly. Duke Walen turned and led his party
towards the ballroom.</p>

<p>We sat down. I took off my mask and wiped my face. 'I think the
Duke was a little the worse for wine, mistress,' I said.</p>

<p>The mirror-mask faced me. My own visage looked back; distorted
and flushed. Those two red lips gave a small smile. Her eyes
remained unreadable behind the mask. 'Yes. Do you think he will
mind that I cannot provide him with a Drezeni dance? I really am
unable to recall any.'</p>

<p>'I think the Duke was being rather rude to you, mistress. The
wine was doing most of the talking. He sought only to &mdash; well, I am
sure as a gentleman he would not seek to humiliate you &mdash; but he was
perhaps having a little sport with you. The detail of the matter
was not important. He will probably forget most of what has passed
here.'</p>


<p>'I hope so. Do you think I am a poor dancer, Oelph?'</p>


<p>'Oh no, mistress! I have not seen you put a step wrong so
far!'</p>


<p>'That is my only goal. Shall we . . . ?'</p>


<p>A young man in a hide and gem-stone mask and wearing the dress
uniform of a captain in the King's Own Frontier Guards appeared at
our side. He bowed deeply. 'Master Oelph? Madam Doctor Vosill?' he
asked.</p>

<p>There was a pause. The Doctor looked at me. 'Yes!' I
blurted.</p>

<p>'The King commands me to invite you to dance with the royal
party during the next figure. It starts directly.'</p>

<p>'Oh, shit,' I heard myself say.</p>

<p>'We are delighted to accept the King's kind invitation,' the
Doctor said, rising smoothly and nodding to the officer. She held
her arm out towards me. I took it in mine.</p>

<p>'Please follow me,' the captain said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We found ourselves arranged in a figure of sixteen with King
Quience, a small, buxom young princess from one of the Sequestered
Kingdoms in the mountains beyond the land of Tassasen, a tall
brother-and-sister prince and princess from Outer Trosile, Duke
Quettil and his sister Lady Ghehere, the Duke and Duchess of Keitz
(uncle and aunt to Guard Commander Adlain), their startlingly
proportioned daughter and her fianc&eacute;, Prince Hills of Faross, the
Guard Commander Adlain himself and Lady Ulier, and, lastly, a young
lady I was introduced to and had seen about court but whose name
escaped me then and now, and her escort, the brother of Lady Ulier,
the young Duke Ulresile we had first encountered at the King's
table in the Hidden Gardens.</p>

<p>I noticed that the youthful Duke made sure that he positioned
himself in our half of the figure, so ensuring that he would have
two opportunities to dance with the Doctor rather than one.</p>

<p>The introductions were made and the dance was named by a very
impressively dressed Wiester, wearing a plain black mask. We took
our places in two lines, male facing female. The King took a last
drink from a goblet, replaced it on a tray, waved away the servant
carrying it and nodded to Wiester, who in turn nodded to the
conductor of the orchestra.</p>

<p>The music began. My heart was beating hard and fast. I was
reasonably familiar with the figure we were engaged upon, but still
concerned that I might make a mistake. I was just as concerned that
the Doctor might commit a serious misstep. I did not think she had
danced so formally complicated a figure before.</p>

<p>'You are enjoying the ball, madam?' Duke Quettil asked as he and
the Doctor advanced upon each other, bowed, held hands, circled and
stepped. I was similarly engaged with the lady Ghehere, who gave
every impression through her carriage and bearing that she had no
interest whatsoever in conversing with the assistant to a woman who
claimed the honourable but un-noble title of doctor, and so I was
at least able both to dance without treading on her toes and to
attend to what passed between my mistress and the Duke.</p>

<p>'Very much, Duke Quettil.'</p>

<p>'I was surprised when the King insisted that you be invited to
join us, but then he is most . . . most merry this evening. Don't
you think?'</p>

<p>'He does appear to be enjoying himself.'</p>

<p>'Not too much, in your opinion?'</p>

<p>'It is not my place to judge the King in any aspect, sir, save
that of his health.'</p>

<p>'Quite. I was granted the privilege of choosing the figure. Is
it to your taste?'</p>

<p>'Entirely so, Duke.'</p>

<p>'It is perhaps a little complex.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps.'</p>

<p>'So much to remember that is not entirely natural, so many
opportunities to make a mistake.'</p>

<p>'Dear Duke,' the Doctor said with some concern. 'I hope this is
not some subtly disguised warning.'</p>

<p>I happened to be circling my immediate partner with my hands
clasped behind my back and was facing .the Duke Quettil at this
point. I got the impression that he was momentarily taken aback,
unsure quite what to say for the moment before the Doctor went on,
'You are not preparing to step on my toes, are you?'</p>

<p>The Duke gave a small, high laugh, and with that the timeous
demands of the dance took both the Doctor and myself away from the
centre of the figure. While our other four-set took the centre, we
stood alongside each other, our hands clasped or on hips as
appropriate, marking time with one foot then the other.</p>

<p>'All right so far, Oelph?' the Doctor said. I thought she
sounded slightly breathless, and even as though she was enjoying
herself.</p>

<p>'Aye, so far, mistress. The Duke seemed&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Were you teaching Quettil extra steps there, Doctor?' Adlain
asked from her other side.</p>

<p>'I'm sure that there is nothing I could teach the Duke, Guard
Commander.'</p>

<p>'I'm equally sure he feels just the same way, madam, and yet he
appeared to lose his way for a moment in that last turn.'</p>

<p>'It is a complicated figure, as he himself pointed out to
me.'</p>

<p>'Yet one he chose.'</p>

<p>'Indeed he did. Does Count Walen dance it as well, do you
think?'</p>

<p>Adlain was silent for a moment. 'I fancy he might, or at least
fancy that he fancies he might.' I saw him glance at the Doctor.
His half-mask allowed him to show a smile. 'However I myself find
it takes all my concentration just minding my own steps without
attempting to scrutinise somebody else's. Ah, excuse me...'</p>

<p>Another set. 'Good Doctor,' young Duke Ulresile said, meeting
her in the centre. His companion, the young lady whose name I
forget, seemed no more inclined to talk to me than Lady
Ghehere.</p>

<p>'Duke,' the Doctor replied.</p>

<p>'You look most striking.'</p>

<p>'Thank you.'</p>

<p>'That mask, is it Brotechian?'</p>

<p>'No, sir, it is silver.'</p>

<p>'Ah. Indeed. But does it originate in Brotechen?'</p>

<p>'No, in Haspide. I had a jeweller fashion it.'</p>

<p>'Ah! It is your own design! How fascinating!'</p>

<p>'My toe, sir.'</p>

<p>'What? Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.'</p>

<p>'And your mask, Duke?'</p>

<p>'What? Oh, ah, some old family thing. Do you like it? Does it
please you? There is a companion one for a lady. I would be
honoured if you would accept it with my compliments.'</p>

<p>'I could not possibly, sir. I'm sure your family would object.
Thank you, nevertheless.'</p>

<p>'But it is nothing! That is, it is very &mdash; it is, I should say,
regarded as most elegant and graceful, the one for a lady, I mean,
but it is entirely mine to gift. It would be an honour!'</p>

<p>The Doctor paused, as though considering this offer. Then she
said, 'And an even greater one for me, sir. However, I already
possess the mask which you see and have admired, and I find I can
only wear one at a time.'</p>

<p>'But . . .'</p>

<p>However, with that it was time for the two to separate, and the
Doctor returned to my side.</p>

<p>'Are you getting all this, Oelph?' she asked, as we caught our
breath and executed the marking-time steps.</p>

<p>'Mistress?'</p>

<p>'Your partners appear to become mute in your presence and yet
you had the look of somebody concentrating on a conversation.'</p>

<p>'I did, mistress?' I asked, feeling my face redden under my
mask.</p>

<p>'You did, Oelph.'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, mistress.'</p>

<p>'Oh, it's quite all right, Oelph. I don't mind. Listen away,
with my blessing.'</p>

<p>The music changed again, and it was time for the two rows of
dancers to form a circle and then reconstitute themselves in an
alternate order. In the circle, the Doctor held my hand firmly but
gently. Her hand, which I'd swear squeezed mine just before she let
go, felt warm and dry, and the skin smooth.</p>

<p>Before too long I was dancing in the middle of the great
ballroom of our Kingdom's second palace &mdash; and arguably its first in
opulence &mdash; with a smiling, giggling, porcelain-skinned princess from
the Half-Hidden Kingdoms in the high, snow-besieged mountains that
climb most-way into the sky beyond the savage anarchy of
Tassasen.</p>

<p>Her cloud-white skin was tattooed on eyelid and temple, and
pierced with jewelled studs at her nostrils and the septum between
nose and upper lip. She was short but curvaceous, dressed in a
highly ornamented and colourful version of the booted,
straight-skirted fashion of her people. She spoke little Imperial
and no Haspidian, and her knowledge of the dance steps was somewhat
fragmentary. Still she contrived to be an enchanting dancing
partner, and I confess that I caught little of what passed between
the Doctor and the King, noting only that the Doctor looked very
tall and graceful and correct while the King seemed most animated
and merry, even if his steps were not as fluent as they would
normally have been (the Doctor had strapped his ankle up especially
tightly that afternoon, knowing that he would be certain to take
part in the dancing). Both wore smiles beneath their
half-masks.</p>

<p>The music swelled and rolled over us, the grand people and
beautiful masks and costumes surged and eddied about us, and we,
resplendent in our finery, were the bright focus of it all. The
Doctor moved and swayed at my side and occasionally I caught a hint
of her perfume, which was one that I was never able to identify and
cannot ever recall seeing her apply. It was an astonishing scent.
It reminded me at once of burned leaves and sea spray, of newly
turned earth and of seasonal flowers in bloom. There was, too,
something tenebrous and intense and sensual about the scent,
something sweet and sharp at the same time, at once lithe and
full-bodied and utterly enigmatic.</p>

<p>In later years, when the Doctor was long gone from us and even
her most manifest features were becoming difficult to recall with
perfect clarity, I would, in diverse moments of private intimacy,
catch a hint of that same odour, but the encounter would always
prove fleeting.</p>

<p>I freely confess that on such occasions the recollection of that
long-ago night, the magnificent ballroom, the splendid profusion of
the dancers and the breath-arresting presence of the Doctor seemed
like a capstan of ache and longing attached by the ropes of memory
to my heart, squeezing and tightening and compressing it until it
seemed inevitable that it must be burst asunder.</p>

<p>Engulfed in that riotous storm of the senses, by eye and ear and
nose beset, I was at once terrified and exhilarated, and
experienced that strange, half-elatory, half-fatalistic alloy of
emotions that leads one to feel that if one died at that precise
moment, suddenly and painlessly (indeed <em>ceased to be</em>
rather than went through the process of dying at all), then it
would somehow be a blessed and culminatory thing.</p>

<p>'The King seems happy, mistress,' I observed as we stood side by
side again.</p>

<p>'Yes. But he is starting to limp,' the Doctor said, and sent the
briefest of frowns in Duke Quettil's direction. 'This was an unwise
choice of dance for a man with an ankle which is still recovering.'
I watched the King, but of course he was not dancing at that point.
However, I could not help but notice that rather than make the
fill-in steps, he was standing still, weight on his good leg,
clapping his hands in time instead. 'How is your Princess?' the
Doctor asked me with a smile.</p>

<p>'Her name is Skoon, I think,' I said, frowning. 'Or that may be
the name of her homeland. Or her father. I'm not sure.'</p>

<p>'She was introduced as Princess of Wadderan, I believe,' the
Doctor told me. 'I doubt that Skuin is her name. That is the name
of the type of dress she is wearing, a skuin-trel. I imagine she
thought you were pointing at that when asking for a name. However,
given that she is a female of the Wadderani royal family, her name
is probably Gul- something or other.'</p>

<p>'Oh. You know of her people?' This confused me, for the
Sequestered or Half-Hidden Kingdoms are some of the most remote and
thoroughly land-locked places in the known world.</p>

<p>'I have read about them,' the Doctor said urbanely, before being
pulled into the centre to dance with the tall Trosilian Prince. I
was paired with his sister. A lanky, generally ungainly and rather
plain woman, she nevertheless danced well enough and seemed quite
as merry as the King. She was happy to engage me in conversation,
though she did seem under the impression that I was a nobleman of
some distinction, an illusion which I was probably rather too slow
to dispel.</p>

<p>'Vosill, you look wonderful,' I heard the King tell the Doctor.
I saw her head dip a little and she murmured something back to him
which I could not hear. I experienced a pang of jealousy that
turned for an instant to wild fear when I realised who it was I was
feeling jealous of. Providence, our own dear King!</p>

<p>The dance went on. We met with the Duke and Duchess of Keitz,
then formed a circle once more &mdash; the Doctor's hand was as firm and
warm and dry as before &mdash; and then took up again with our earlier
eightsome. I was breathing hard by this time and did not wonder
that people the age of Duke Walen usually sat out this sort of
dance. Especially when one was masked, it was a long, hot and
tiring business.</p>

<p>Duke Quettil danced with the Doctor in frosty silence. Young
Ulresile fairly ran into the middle of our group to meet the Doctor
and continued in his attempt to press some portion of his family's
equity upon her, while she parried each suggestion as neatly as it
was made awkwardly.</p>

<p>Finally (and thankfully, for my feet were becoming quite sore in
my new dress shoes and I was in some need of relieving myself) we
shared a set with Lady Ulier and Guard Commander Adlain.</p>

<p>'Tell me, Doctor,' Adlain said as they danced together. 'What is
a . . . gahan?'</p>

<p>'I'm not sure. Do you mean a <em>gaan</em>?'</p>

<p>'Of course, you pronounce it so much better than I. Yes. A
gaan.'</p>

<p>'It is the title of an officer in the Drezeni civil command. In
Haspidus, or in Imperial terms, it would roughly correspond to a
town master or burghead, though without the military authority and
with an additional expectation that the man or woman would be
capable of representing Drezen at junior consular level when
abroad.'</p>

<p>'Most illuminating.'</p>

<p>'Why do you ask, sir?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I read a report recently from one of our ambassadors . . .
from Cuskery, I think, which mentioned the word as though it was
some sort of rank but without including any explanation. I intended
to ask one of our diplomatic people but it must have slipped my
mind. Seeing you and thinking of Drezen obviously secured it
again.'</p>

<p>'I see,' the Doctor said. There was more passed between them,
but then Lady Ulier, Duke Ulresile's sister, spoke to me.</p>

<p>'My brother seemed most fixed upon your lady physician,' she
said. Lady Ulier was a few years older than either myself or her
brother, with the same narrow-pinched and sallow look as he, though
her dark eyes were bright and her brown hair lustrous. Her voice
was somewhat strident and abrasive even when pitched low,
however.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said. I could think of little else.</p>

<p>'Yes. I imagine he seeks a physician for our family, which is of
course of the finest quality. Our own midwife grows old. Perhaps
the lady physician will provide a suitable replacement when the
King grows tired of her, should we think her suitable and
sufficiently trustworthy.'</p>

<p>'With the greatest respect, ma'am, I think that would demean her
talents.'</p>

<p>The lady looked down her long nose at me. 'Do you, indeed! Well,
I think not. And you perjure yourself, sir, for the greatest
respect you could have accorded me would have been to have said
nothing to contradict what I had just said.'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, ma'am. It was simply that I could not bear
to see so noble and fair a lady so deceived regarding the abilities
of Doctor Vosill.'</p>

<p>'Yes. And you are . . . ?'</p>

<p>'Oelph, my lady. It is my honour to have been the Doctor's
assistant throughout the time she has treated our good King.'</p>

<p>'And your family?'</p>

<p>'Is no more, my lady. My parents were of the Koetic persuasion
and perished when the Imperial regiment of our late King sacked the
city of Derla. I was a baby in swaddling at the time. An officer
took pity on me when he might as well have thrown me on to a fire
and brought me back to Haspidus. I was raised amongst the orphans
of officers, a loyal and faithful servant of the crown.'</p>

<p>The lady looked at me with some horror. In a strangled voice she
said, 'And you wish to teach <em>me</em> the proprieties of who should serve
our family?' She laughed in such a way that the shriek produced
surely convinced most of those surrounding us that I had just
stamped upon her toe, then for the rest of the set she kept her
nose angled as though trying to balance a marble-fruit upon its
tip.</p>

<p>The music had stopped. We all bowed to each other and the King,
hobbling a little, was surrounded by dukes and princes all of whom
seemed desperately anxious to talk to him. The little
Wadderan princess, whose name I had established was Gul-Aplit, gave
me a polite wave as a forbidding-looking chaperone appeared
at her side and escorted her away. 'Are you all
right, Oelph?' the Doctor asked.</p>

<p>'I am very well, mistress,' I told her. 'A little warm.'</p>

<p>'Let's get something to drink and then step outside. What do you
say?'</p>

<p>'I'd say that was a very good idea, mistress, if not two.'</p>

<p>We collected two tall goblets of some form of aromatic punch
which we were assured by the servants was weak in alcohol and then,
with our masks off at last &mdash; and following a brief period to obey
the call of nature &mdash; we made our way out on to the balcony which
ran round the outside of the ballroom, joining a good hundred or so
others taking the fragrant night air.</p>

<p>It was a dark night and would be long. Seigen had almost joined
Xamis at sundown that evening and for a good quarter of the
wholeday there would be only the moons to light the sky.
Foy and Iparine were our lanterns that evening, their bluey-grey
luminescence filled out along the balcony's tiles and the
terraces of garden, fountain and hedge by glowing paper
lamps, cressets of oilwood and scented pole-torches.</p>

<p>Duke and Duchess Ormin and their party approached us on the
balcony, their way lit for them by dwarves carrying short poles, on
the tip of which were large spheres of clear glass containing what
looked like millions of soft and tiny sparks. As these curious
apparitions came closer we saw that the globes contained hundreds
and hundreds of glowflies, all milling and darting about in their
strange confinement. They spread little light, but much amazement
and delight. The Duke exchanged nods with the Doctor, though the
Duchess did not deign to acknowledge us.</p>

<p>'Did I hear you telling the very young but very grand Lady Ulier
your life history, Oelph?' the Doctor asked, sipping at her goblet
as we strolled.</p>

<p>'I mentioned something about my upbringing, mistress. It may
have been a mistake. She cannot think better of either of us for
it.'</p>

<p>'From the impression, not to mention the looks I got,
I do not think she could think much less of me, but I'm sorry if
she finds your orphanhood in some way reprehensible.'</p>

<p>'That and the fact that my parents were Koetics.'</p>

<p>'Well, one must allow for the prejudices of nobles. Your
forebears professed themselves not only republican, but so
god-fearing they had neither dread nor respect left for any worldly
authority.'</p>

<p>'Theirs was a sadly mistaken creed, mistress, and I am not proud
to be associated with it, though I honour my parents' memory as any
child must.'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked at me. 'You do not resent what happened to
them?'</p>

<p>'To the extent that I resent their suppression as a people who
preached forgiveness rather than violence, I condemn the Empire.
For the fact that I was recognised as an innocent and rescued, I
thank Providence that I was discovered by a Haspidian officer who
acted under the more humane orders of our good King's father.</p>

<p>'But I never knew my parents, mistress, and I have never met
anybody who knew them, and their faith is meaningless to me. And
the Empire, whose very existence might have fuelled an urge for
vengeance on my part, is gone, brought down by the fire which fell
from the sky. One unchallengeably mighty force brought down by an
even greater one.' I looked at her then, and felt, from the
expression in her eyes, that we were talking and not just behaving
as equals. 'Resentment, mistress? What is the point of feeling
that?'</p>

<p>She took my hand in hers for a moment then, and squeezed it
rather as she had during the dance, and after that she put her arm
through mine, an action that had fallen into disuse and even
disrepute within polite society and which occasioned not a few
looks. To my own surprise I felt honoured rather than embarrassed.
It was a gesture of friendliness rather than anything else, but it
was a gesture of closeness and comfort, and I felt just then that I
was the most favoured man in all the palace, regardless of birth,
title, rank or circumstance.</p>

<p>'Ah! I am murdered! Murdered! Help me! Help me! Murdered!'</p>

<p>The voice rang out across the balcony. Everybody stopped as
though frozen into statues, then looked round at a tall door
leading from one of the smaller rooms next to the ballroom as it
opened further and a half-clothed figure fell slowly out of it into
the light, gripping the pale gold curtains that fluted back inside,
where thin, girlish screams began to sound.</p>

<p>The man, dressed only in a white shirt, gradually rolled over so
that his face pointed towards the moons. The pure white shirt
seemed to glow in the moonlight. High on his chest near one
shoulder there was a bright, vividly red mark, like a freshly
picked blossom. The man's collapse to the stones of the balcony was
accomplished with a sort of idle grace, until his violent grip on
the curtains and his weight overcame their supports and they gave
way.</p>

<p>With that, he slumped quickly to the ground and the curtains
came billowing, folding down upon him, like syrup on to the body of
a struggling insect, entirely covering his round shape so that,
while the screams from the room still sounded and everybody still
stood where they were, staring, it was almost as though there was
no body there at all.</p>

<p>The Doctor moved first, dropping her goblet on to the balcony
with a crash and running towards the tall, slowly swinging
door.</p>

<p>It was a moment or two longer before I could break the spell
that had descended upon me, but eventually I was able to follow the
Doctor &mdash; through a crowd of servants most of whom suddenly and to
my confusion seemed to be carrying swords &mdash; to where the Doctor was
already kneeling, throwing back the folds of curtain, burrowing
down to where the twitching, bleeding form of Duke Walen lay
dying.</p>

<h3 class="chapter">14. THE BODYGUARD</h3>

<p>'Loose!'</p>

<p>The small catapult bucked, the arm &mdash; indeed not much bigger than
a man's outstretched arm &mdash; flicked forward and thudded against the
hide cushion on the weapon's tall cross-beam. The stone burred away
through the air, arcing over the lower terrace and down towards the
garden below. The projectile hit alongside one of DeWar's cities,
embedding itself in the carefully raked soil and kicking up a big
puff of red-brown dust that hung for a while in the air, slowly
drifting off to the one side and settling gradually back to the
ground.</p>

<p>'Oh, bad luck!'</p>

<p>'Very close!'</p>

<p>'Next time.'</p>

<p>'Very nearly, General Lattens,' DeWar said. He had been sitting
on the balustrade, arms crossed, one leg dangling. He jumped off on
to the black and white tiles of the balcony and squatted by his own
miniature catapult. He pulled quickly and powerfully on the round
wheel which ratcheted the creaking, groaning wooden arm back until
it settled about three-quarters of the way towards the horizontal
rear cross-member. The arm bowed fractionally with the strain of
the twisted hide at its base trying to force it forward again.</p>

<p>Lattens, meanwhile, got up on to the same stone rail DeWar had
been sitting on. His nurse held on tightly to the back of his
jacket to prevent him from falling. Lattens raised his toy
telescope to his eye to survey the damage done in the garden
below.</p>

<p>'A little to the left, next time, my lad,' UrLeyn told his son.
The Protector, his brother RuLeuin, Doctor BreDelle, BiLeth,
Commander ZeSpiole and the concubine Perrund sat attended by
various servants on an awninged platform raised to about the same
height as the balustrade and overlooking the scene.</p>

<p>Lattens stamped his foot on the stonework. His nurse held him
tighter.</p>

<p>Perrund, veiled in gauzy red, turned to the Protector. 'Sir, I'm
sure the nurse holds him well enough, but it makes my bones ache
seeing him up there. Would you humour one of your older ladies'
timid foolishness by calling for a step-ladder? It would let him
see over the rail without having to climb on to it.'</p>

<p>Foreign minister BiLeth frowned and made a <em>tssk</em>ing noise.</p>

<p>UrLeyn pursed his lips. 'Hmm. Good idea,' he said. He beckoned a
servant.</p>

<p>The entire terrace of the garden two storeys below had been
divided into two and modelled to resemble a landscape in miniature,
with hills, mountains, forests, a large walled capital city, a
dozen or so smaller cities, twice as many towns, many roads and
bridges and three or four rivers flowing into a couple of small,
about bath-sized lakes on each side and then on into a large body
of water which represented an inland sea.</p>

<p>The sea was in the shape of two rough circles which just met in
the middle, so that there was a short, narrow channel connecting
the two great lakes. Various of each territory's towns and cities
lay on the shores of the two smaller lakes, with even more on the
coasts of the two lobes of the sea, though in each case one
territory had many more settlements round one part of the sea than
the other, DeWar's territory having the most round the lobe of
water nearer to the balcony and the two catapults.</p>

<p>DeWar secured the triggering post on his catapult and carefully
unhitched the winding mechanism, then selected a stone from the
pile between the two model weapons and, once Lattens had climbed
down from the balustrade, loaded the stone into the cup at the end
of the machine's arm. He repositioned the catapult according to
chalk marks on the black tiles, stood, eyes narrowed, to survey his
target area, squatted to adjust the catapult's position once more,
then took the stone out of the cup and reconnected the winding
mechanism to let out a little of the strain before re-latching the
triggering post.</p>

<p>'Oh, come <em>on</em>, DeWar!' Lattens said, jumping up and down and
shaking his telescope. He was dressed as a noble general, and the
servant who was tensioning and repositioning his catapult was in
the uniform of a Ducal bombardier.</p>

<p>DeWar closed one eye and made a fearful grimace as he turned to
the boy. 'Har,' he said, in a voice a rather unsubtle actor might
employ when asked to impersonate a worthy rustic, 'beggin' the
young massur's pardin to be sure, sor, but I has got to be doin' me
adjussmints, don't ye know, har!'</p>

<p>'Providence, the fellow's a fool indeed,' BiLeth muttered.
However, UrLeyn laughed, and BiLeth found it in him to affect a
smile.</p>

<p>Lattens squealed with delight at this nonsense and put his hands
to his mouth, nearly sticking his telescope into his eye.</p>

<p>DeWar made a few final adjustments to his catapult, then, with a
look round to make sure Lattens was well out of the way, said,
'Fire, me boys!' and flicked the triggering latch away.</p>

<p>The rock whistled into the blue sky. Lattens howled with
excitement and ran to the balustrade. DeWar's rock landed almost in
the centre of one of the smaller lakes in Lattens' territory. The
boy shrieked.</p>

<p>'Oh no!'</p>

<p>DeWar had already landed a hefty projectile in the other small
lake on Lattens' side, swamping all the towns and the single city
on its shores. Lattens had hit one of DeWar's lakes too, but not
the other. The rock sent up a great tall fountain of water. The
waves from the impact rippled quickly out, heading for the shore.
'Aargh!' Lattens cried. The waves made landfall, causing the water
first to retreat from the miniature beaches and ports and then rear
up and wash against the flimsily made buildings of the lake-side
towns, washing them all away.</p>

<p>'Oh, unlucky, young sir, unlucky,' Doctor BreDelle said, then in
a low voice to UrLeyn added, 'Sir, I think the boy grows
over-excited.'</p>

<p>'Fine shot, DeWar!' UrLeyn called, clapping. 'Oh, let him be
excited, Doctor,' he said to BreDelle in a lower voice. 'He has
spent long enough swaddled in his bed. It's good to see a bit of
colour in his cheeks again.'</p>

<p>'As you wish, sir, but he is still not fully recovered.'</p>

<p>'Mr DeWar would make a fine bombardier,' Commander ZeSpiole
said.</p>

<p>UrLeyn laughed. 'We could use him in Ladenscion.'</p>

<p>'We could dispatch him forthwith,' agreed BiLeth.</p>

<p>'Things go better there, don't they, brother?' RuLeuin said,
letting a servant refill his glass. He glanced at BiLeth, who
assumed a grave expression.</p>

<p>UrLeyn snorted. 'Better than when they were going badly,' he
agreed. 'But still not well enough.' He looked to his brother, then
back at his son, who was anxiously supervising the loading of his
own catapult. 'The boy grows better. If that keeps up I may take it
as my signal to assume command of the war myself.'</p>

<p>'At last!' RuLeuin said. 'Oh, I'm sure that would be the best
thing, brother. You are our best general, still. The war in
Ladenscion needs you. I hope I may accompany you there. May I? I
have a fine company of cavalry now. You must come and see them
train some day.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, brother,' UrLeyn said, smoothing a hand over his
short grey beard. 'However, I am undecided. I may ask you to stay
on here in Crough and be my regent, in equal partnership with
YetAmidous and ZeSpiole. Would you rather that?'</p>

<p>'Oh, sir!' RuLeuin reached out and touched the Protector's arm.
'That would be a singular honour!'</p>

<p>'No, it would be a treble honour, brother,' UrLeyn told him with
a tired smile. 'ZeSpiole? What do you say?'</p>

<p>'I heard what you said, sir, but I can scarcely believe it.
Would you honour me so?'</p>

<p>'I would. If I depart for the borderlands. It is still not
certain yet. BiLeth, you will advise my trio of proxies as well as
you have me on matters foreign?'</p>

<p>BiLeth, whose face had taken on a frozen expression when he had
heard what the Protector was proposing, let his features relax
somewhat. 'Of course, sir.'</p>

<p>'And General YetAmidous is agreeable?' RuLeuin asked.</p>

<p>'He will stay if I ask him to, or like you he will gladly come
to Ladenscion with me. I could use each of you in both places, but
that cannot be.'</p>

<p>'Sir, excuse my interruption,' the lady Perrund said. 'The
ladder.'</p>

<p>A wooden library step-ladder was carried forward by two servants
and deposited on the balcony's tiled surface near the viewing
platform.</p>

<p>'What? Ah, yes. Lattens!" UrLeyn called to his son, who was
still fussing over the degree of tension in the catapult and the
size of rock to throw. 'Here. This might be a better observation
point for you! Position it as you see fit.'</p>

<p>Lattens looked uncertain for a moment, then appeared to take to
the idea. 'Ah-ha! A <em>siege</em> engine!' He wagged the telescope
at DeWar, who scowled at the ladder as the servants brought it
forward, closer to the edge of the terrace. 'I have the measure of
you now, bad baron!' Lattens cried. DeWar growled and retreated
with comedic fearfulness from the steps as they approached.</p>

<p>Lattens climbed up the steps to the top, so that his feet were
about level with the head of his nurse, who had remained on the
balcony but followed him round as he'd ascended, watching
anxiously. DeWar sidled up to the steps as well, glowering up at
the boy.</p>

<p>'That will do nicely, bombardier,' Lattens yelled. 'Fire when
ready!'</p>

<p>The rock hurtled up and out and for a moment seemed to hang
above the coast-line of the part of the inland sea which held most
of DeWar's remaining cities. 'Oh no!' Lattens cried.</p>

<p>The rules were that each player could drop only one stone into
the inland sea. Lattens and DeWar each had, accordingly, one very
large stone apiece to be used for this very purpose in the hope of
swamping a handful of his enemy's cities with one strike. The stone
Lattens had caused to be lobbed on this occasion was a medium-sized
projectile. If it landed in the sea, especially in one of the
shallower areas near the coast, it might do very little damage on
its own while at the same time preventing the boy from landing his
one big rock where it might cause the most destruction.</p>

<p>The rock whacked into a coastal city, causing a small splash
from the harbour but sending up a greater cloud of dust and
scattering splintered wood and bits of delicate clay buildings
across the landscape and splashing out across the water.</p>

<p>'Yes, boy!' UrLeyn said, jumping to his feet.</p>

<p>RuLeuin rose too. 'Well done!'</p>

<p>'Fine shot!' called BreDelle. BiLeth clapped decorously.</p>

<p>ZeSpiole thumped his seat-arm. 'Magnificent!'</p>

<p>DeWar clenched his fists and let out a roar of anguish.</p>

<p>'Hurrah!' Lattens yelled and whirled his arms about. He
overbalanced and began to fall off the steps. Perrund watched DeWar
dart forward, then check himself as the nurse caught the boy.
Lattens frowned down at his nurse then struggled in her arms until
she put him back where he had been standing.</p>

<p>'Mind yourself, boy!' UrLeyn called, laughing.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, sir,' Perrund said. Her hand was at her throat, just
beneath the red veil, where her heart seemed to have lodged. 'I
thought he'd be safer&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, he's fine!' UrLeyn told her with a sort of jovial
exasperation. 'Never you fear.' He turned back. '<em>Damn</em> fine
shot, lad!' he shouted. 'More of those, if you please, then the
great-grand-dad rock in the centre of his sea!'</p>

<p>'Ladenscion is finished!' Lattens cried, shaking his fist at
DeWar and holding on to the projecting spire of the steps with his
other hand. 'Providence protects us!'</p>

<p>'Oh, it's Ladenscion now, not the Empire?' UrLeyn laughed.</p>

<p>'Brother,' RuLeuin said, 'I cannot think which would be the
greater honour, to be at your side or to help rule in your place.
Be assured I shall do whatever you ask of me to the best of my
abilities.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure you will,' UrLeyn said.</p>

<p>'As your brother says, sir,' Commander ZeSpiole said, leaning
forward to catch the Protector's eye.</p>

<p>'Well, it may not come to that,' UrLeyn said. 'We may have news
by the next rider that the barons are desperate to sue for peace.
But I am glad you both accept my proposal.'</p>

<p>'Gladly, brother!'</p>

<p>'Humbly, sir.'</p>

<p>'Good, so we are all agreed.'</p>

<p>DeWar's next shot thudded into farmland, causing him to caper
arid make cursing sounds. Lattens laughed and followed that with a
shot which destroyed a town. DeWar's next demolished a bridge.
Lattens replied with a couple of off-target rocks but then hit a
city while DeWar's matching shots hit nothing but earth.</p>

<p>Lattens decided to use his biggest rock and attempt to
obliterate most of DeWar's remaining cities in one go.</p>

<p>'That's the boy!' his father called. 'Strike now!'</p>

<p>With much groaning and creaking from the coiled twists of
stretched hide &mdash; and a few groans and whimpers from DeWar, standing
watching &mdash; the arm of Lattens' catapult was tightened to its
maximum extension and sat arched with stored power.</p>

<p>'Are you sure that's not too much?' UrLeyn shouted. 'You'll hit
your own sea!'</p>

<p>'No, sir! I'll put other rocks on as well as the big one!'</p>

<p>'Very well then,' the Protector told his son. 'Mind you don't
break the weapon, though.'</p>

<p>'Father!' the boy called. 'May I load it myself? Oh,
please?'</p>

<p>The servant dressed like a bombardier was about to pick up the
heaviest rock from Lattens' pile of ammunition. He hesitated. DeWar
lost his comical expression. Perrund took a deep breath.</p>

<p>'Sir,' she said, but was interrupted.</p>

<p>'I cannot allow the boy to lift such a large rock, sir,' Doctor
BreDelle said, leaning close to the Protector. 'It will put too
great a strain on his system. His frame is weakened by the long
time spent in bed.'</p>

<p>UrLeyn looked at ZeSpiole. 'I'm more worried about the
catapult loosing while he's loading it, sir,' the Guard Commander
said.</p>

<p>'Generals do not load their own weapons, sir,' UrLeyn told the
boy sternly.</p>

<p>'I know that, Father, but <em>please</em>? This is not a real
war, it is only pretend.'</p>

<p>'Well, shall I give you a hand then?' UrLeyn called.</p>

<p>'No!' Lattens yelled, stamping his foot and tossing his redblond
curls. 'No thank you, sir!'</p>

<p>UrLeyn sat back with a gesture of resignation and a small smile.
'The lad knows his own mind. He is mine, all right.' He waved to
his son. 'Very well, General Lattens! Load as you will and may
Providence guide the projectiles.'</p>

<p>Lattens chose a couple of smaller rocks and loaded them one at a
time into the waiting cup of the catapult, panting as he lifted
them up. Then he squatted, took a firm grip of the biggest stone
and with a grunt lifted it to his chest. He turned and staggered
towards his catapult.</p>

<p>DeWar took a half-step closer to the machine. Lattens did not
seem to notice. He grunted again as he hoisted the rock up to his
neck level and shuffled closer to the tensed arm of the waiting
machine.</p>

<p>DeWar seemed to slide rather than step another stride closer to
the catapult, almost to within grabbing distance of the boy, while
his gaze concentrated both on the firing latch and on Lattens' feet
and legs as they edged nearer to it.</p>

<p>The boy teetered as he leant over the catapult's cup. He was
breathing hard, the sweat running down his brow.</p>

<p>'Steady, lad,' Perrund heard the Protector whisper. His hands
clutched at the arms of his chair, the knuckles pale with their own
loaded tension.</p>

<p>DeWar was closer now, within reach of the boy.</p>

<p>Lattens grunted and rolled the rock into the cup. It crunched
on top of the two already occupying the scoop. The whole catapult
seemed to quiver, and DeWar tensed, as though about to pounce on
the child and tear him away, but then the boy took a step back,
wiped his sweating face and turned to smile at his father, who
nodded and sat back in his seat, sighing with relief. He looked at
RuLeuin and the others. 'There now,' he said, and swallowed.</p>

<p>'Mr Bombardier,' Lattens said, with a flourish towards the
catapult. The servant nodded and took up his position by the
machine.</p>

<p>DeWar had drifted back towards his own catapult.</p>

<p>'Wait!' Lattens called, and ran up the library step-ladder
again. His nurse resumed her place beneath. Lattens took out his
sword, raised it and then dropped it. 'Now!'</p>

<p>The catapult made a terrific snapping noise, the one large rock
and the two smaller ones sailed into the air in significantly
different directions and everybody sat or leant forward to see
where they would land.</p>

<p>The big rock missed its target, splashing into the shallows near
one of DeWar's coastal cities and showering it with mud but
otherwise doing little damage. One of the smaller stones hit some
of DeWar's farmland and the other demolished one of Lattens' own
towns.</p>

<p>'Oh.'</p>

<p>'Oh dear.'</p>

<p>'Bad luck, young master.'</p>

<p>'For shame!'</p>

<p>Lattens said nothing. He stood, looking utterly crestfallen, at
the top of the ladder, his little wooden sword hanging loosely in
his hand. He looked back at his father with sad, dejected eyes.</p>

<p>His father frowned, then winked at him. The boy's expression did
not change. Silence hung under the platform's awning.</p>

<p>DeWar jumped up on the balustrade and crouched there, knuckles
dragging on the stonework. 'Ha!' he said, then jumped down.
'Missed!' He had already tensioned his own catapult, the arm bowed
back to about the two-thirds position. 'Victory is mine! Hee-hee!'
He chose the biggest stone from his own supply, wound some more
tension into the machine and put the rock in the scoop. He looked
up at Lattens with a fierce, mischievous grin, which faltered only
momentarily when he saw the look on the child's face. He rubbed his
hands and wagged one finger at the boy. 'Now we see who's boss, my
young pretender-general!'</p>

<p>He adjusted the catapult slightly and then pulled the lanyard.
The catapult juddered and the great rock whooshed up into the sky.
DeWar leapt back on to the stone railing again.</p>

<p>The giant stone was a sailing black shape against the sky and
clouds for a long moment, then it rushed back to earth and dropped
with a titanic splash into the sea.</p>

<p>The water threw itself up into the air in a great explosive
tower of white foam, then slumped back down and rushed out in all
directions in a mighty circular wave.</p>

<p>'What?' DeWar screeched from the balustrade, putting his hands
to the sides of his head and grabbing two handfuls of hair. 'No!
No! Nooooo!'</p>

<p>'Ha <em>ha</em>!' Lattens yelled, pulled his general's hat off his head
and threw it in the air. 'Ha ha ha!'</p>

<p>The rock had fallen not into the lobe of the sea which was
rimmed mostly by Lattens' towns and cities but that which held
almost all DeWar's intact settlements. The great wave rushed out
from where it had landed, a good couple of strides or so from the
straits separating the two lobes of the sea. One by one it swamped
the cities and towns by the water, flooding one or two of Lattens'
but destroying a great deal more of DeWar's.</p>

<p>'Hurrah!' RuLeuin yelled, and threw his own hat into the air.
Perrund smiled broadly at DeWar from behind the veil. UrLeyn nodded
and grinned and clapped. Lattens gave a deep bow and made a rude,
tongue-wagging gesture at DeWar, who had rolled off the stone
railing and was curled up on the tiles by the side of the
balustrade, thumping one clenched fist weakly off the tiled
surface.</p>

<p>'No more!' he moaned. 'I give in! He's too good for me!
Providence defends the Protector and all his generals! I am an
unworthy wretch ever to have set myself against them! Take pity on
me and let me surrender like the abject cur that I am!'</p>

<p>'I win!' Lattens said, and with a grin at his nurse he twirled
on the platform and let himself fall backwards into the woman's
arms. She grunted with the impact, but caught the boy and held
him.</p>

<p>'Here, lad! Here!' His father stood and went to the front of the
platform, holding out his arms. 'Bring that brave young warrior to
me!'</p>

<p>The nurse duly delivered Lattens into his father's embrace while
the others gathered round, applauding and laughing and clapping
backs and offering congratulations.</p>

<p>'A fine campaign, young man!'</p>

<p>'Quite splendid!'</p>

<p>'Providence in your pocket!'</p>

<p>'Well, well done!'</p>

<p>'&mdash; and then we could play the game at night, Father, when it's a
dark night and make flame-balls and light them and set the cities
on fire! Couldn't we?'</p>

<p>DeWar stood and brushed himself down. Perrund looked at him over
her veil and he grinned and even blushed a little.</p>

<h3 class="chapter">15. THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p>'Well?' the King asked.</p>

<p>The Doctor leaned closer and peered at the wound. Duke Walen's
body lay on a long table in the withdrawing room where he had been
murdered. The small feast that had occupied the table when we had
brought the body in had been set on the floor to one side. The
table cloth had been wrapped over the Duke's body so that his legs
and belly and his head had been covered, leaving only his chest
exposed. He had been pronounced dead by the Doctor, though not
until after she had done the most extraordinary thing.</p>

<p>The Doctor had seemed to kiss the old man while he lay bleeding
and shaking on the balcony. She had knelt by his side and blown her
own breath into him, puffing out first her cheeks and then his, so
that his chest rose and fell. She was at the same time attempting
to staunch the flow of blood that had issued from the wound in his
chest, using a piece of material torn from her own dress. This then
became my duty, using a clean kerchief while she concentrated on
blowing into Duke Walen's mouth.</p>

<p>After a while, when she had been unable to feel any pulse for
some long time, she had shaken her head and sat back, exhausted, on
the floor.</p>

<p>A ring of servants, all with swords or long knives, had been
established round the scene. When the Doctor and I looked up it was
to see Duke Quettil, the two Guard Commanders, Adlain and Polchiek,
and the King looking down at us. Behind us, in the darkened room, a
girl was weeping quietly.</p>

<p>'Bring him inside. Light all the candles,' Duke Quettil told the
armed servants. He looked at the King, who nodded.</p>

<p>'Well, Doctor?' the King said again.</p>

<p>'A dagger wound, I think,' the Doctor said. 'A very thin, sharp
blade. Steeply angled. It must have penetrated the heart. Much of
the bleeding was internal, which is why it's still seeping out. If
I'm to be sure of all this, I will need to open the corpse.'</p>

<p>'I think we know the main thing, which is that he is dead,'
Adlain said. From beyond a line of servants by the windows, a
woman's screams could be heard. I imagined it was the Duke's
wife.</p>

<p>'Who was in the room?' Quettil asked his Guard Commander.</p>

<p>'These two,' Polchiek said, nodding at a young man and woman,
both hardly any older than myself, both quite handsome and with
their dress in some disarray. Each was held from behind by two of
the armed servants. It was only now starting to occur to me that
there had been a particular explanation for the great numbers of
servants at the ball, and for the fact that many of them looked
somewhat coarser than one expected of servants. They were really
guards. That was why they had all suddenly produced weapons at the
first hint of mischief.</p>

<p>The young woman's face was red and swollen with crying, and held
a look of blank terror. A wail from beyond the windows drew her
attention and she stared in that direction. The face of the young
man at her side looked almost as bloodless as the body of Duke
Walen.</p>

<p>'And who are you?' Adlain asked the young couple.</p>

<p>'Uo-Uo-Uoljeval, sir,' the young man said, swallowing heavily.
'A squire in the em-employ of Duke Walen, sir.'</p>

<p>Adlain looked at the young woman, who was staring straight
ahead. 'And you, madam?'</p>

<p>The young woman shivered and looked not at Adlain but at the
Doctor. Still she did not say anything.</p>

<p>Eventually the young man said, 'Droythir, sir. Her name is
Droythir. Of Mizui. A chambermaid to Lady Gilseon. My
betrothed.'</p>

<p>'Sir, can't we let the Duchess in now?' the Doctor asked the
King. He shook his head and held up one hand.</p>

<p>Guard Commander Adlain jerked his head back as though pointing
at the girl with his chin and demanded, 'And what were you doing in
here, madam?'</p>

<p>The young woman stared at him as though he'd spoken in some
utterly unknown language. It crossed my mind that she was indeed a
foreigner. Then the young man started to weep and said, 'It was
only for his pleasure, sirs, please!'</p>

<p>Through his tears he looked in turn at each of the faces
watching him. 'Sirs, he said he liked such sport, and would reward
us. We knew nothing, nothing until we heard him cry out. He was
there. There, behind there, watching us from behind the screen
there. He knocked it over when he &mdash; when he&mdash;' The young man looked
round as best he could at a screen lying on the floor near one
corner of the room, by a door, and started to breathe very
quickly.</p>

<p>'Calm <em>down,</em>' Adlain snapped. The young man closed his
eyes and slumped in the grip of the two guards. They looked at each
other, then at Adlain and Polchiek, who was also, I thought,
distinctly pale and haggard.</p>

<p>'And there was a dark bird,' the young woman said suddenly, in
a strange, hollow voice. Her eyes stared straight ahead out of her
pale, sweat-sheened face.</p>

<p>'What?' Polchiek said.</p>

<p>'A dark bird,' she said, looking straight at the Doctor. 'It was
very dark because the gentleman wished only for one candle to light
us, but I saw it. A dark bird, or a nightwing.'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked puzzled. 'A dark bird?' she said,
frowning.</p>

<p>'I think we have learned all we can from you, madam,' Quettil
said to the Doctor. 'You may go.'</p>

<p>'No,' the King said to her. 'Stay, Doctor.'</p>

<p>Quettil's jaw worked.</p>

<p>'Were you doing what I think you were doing?' the King asked the
young woman. He glanced at the Doctor. The orchestra faltered in
the ballroom.</p>

<p>The young woman turned her empty-looking face slowly towards the
King. 'Sir,' she said, and I knew she did not realise who she was
talking to. 'Yes, sir. On the couch there.' She pointed to a couch
in the centre of the room. A candelabrum holding one extinguished
candle lay knocked over nearby.</p>

<p>'And Duke Walen was watching from behind the screen,' Adlain
said.</p>

<p>'It was his pleasure, sir.' The young woman looked down at the
man kneeling weeping by her side. 'We saw no harm in it.'</p>

<p>'Well, there was harm, madam,' Quettil said quietly, his voice
hardly more than a breath.</p>

<p>'We'd been doing it a while, sirs,' the young woman said, her
empty, staring eyes directed towards the Doctor. 'There was a
noise. I thought it was somebody trying the window doors again,
sir, but then the old gentleman cried out and the screen came
tumbling down and I saw the nightwing.'</p>

<p>'You saw the Duke?' Polchiek asked her.</p>

<p>She swivelled her head towards him. 'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'You saw nobody else?'</p>

<p>'Just the gentleman, sir,' she said, looking back to the Doctor.
'In his shirt. He had his hand up here.' She shrugged on one side
only, and looked down to her left at the top of her chest near her
shoulder. 'He was crying out that he'd been murdered.'</p>

<p>'The door behind him,' Adlain said. 'There, behind where the
screen was. Was the door open?'</p>

<p>'No, sir.'</p>

<p>'You are sure.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>Quettil leaned towards the King. 'My man Ralinge will make sure
this is the truth,' he murmured. The Doctor heard this and glared
at the Duke. The King only frowned.</p>

<p>'Is the door locked?' Adlain asked Polchiek.</p>

<p>Polchiek frowned. 'It should be,' he said, 'and the key should
be in the lock.' He crossed the room to the door, found that there
was no key, looked to the floor for a few moments, then pulled and
pushed at the door.. He felt inside a fat pouch at his waist,
pulled out a ring bristling with long keys and eventually found one
which he tried in the door's lock. The lock clicked, the door
opened inwards and a couple of armed guards dressed as servants
looked quizzically in, straightening when they saw their Commander,
who spoke briefly to them and closed and locked the door again. He
returned to the group round the table. 'The guards have been there
since a little after the alarm was raised,' he told Adlain. His
big, clumsy-looking fingers fumbled with the ring of keys, trying
to fit it back into the pouch at his waist.</p>

<p>'How many keys to that door are there?' Adlain asked.</p>

<p>'This one, one for the palace seneschal and the one which ought
to be in the door, on this side,' Polchiek told him.</p>

<p>'Droythir, where was this dark bird you saw?' the Doctor
asked.</p>

<p>'Where the gentleman was, ma'am.' Suddenly her face seemed to
collapse and a look of uncertainty and sadness wrote itself across
her features. 'Perhaps it was just a shadow, ma'am. The candle, and
the screen falling.' She looked down. 'A shadow,' she murmured to
herself.</p>

<p>'Let the Duchess in,' the King said, as one of the guards
dressed as a servant approached Quettil and muttered into his
ear.</p>

<p>'The Duchess has fainted and been taken to her room, sir,'
Quettil told the King. 'However, I am told there is a young page
who may have something to tell us.'</p>

<p>'Well then, bring him in,' the King said, sounding annoyed.
Droythir and Uoljeval were pulled back towards the centre of the
room by those holding them. The young man staggered to his feet,
still weeping quietly. The girl stared ahead, silent.</p>

<p>Feulecharo approached from the doors, looking smaller than I had
ever seen him look, his face almost translucent, his eyes
bulging.</p>

<p>'Feulecharo?' Adlain said. He looked round the others. 'Page to
the late Duke,' he said by way of explanation to those who needed
it.</p>

<p>Feulecharo cleared his throat. He looked nervously round us all,
then saw the Doctor and gave me a small smile. 'Your majesty,' he
said, bowing to the King. 'Duke Quettil, sirs, madam. I know
something &mdash; very little, but something &mdash; of what happened
here.'</p>

<p>'You do?' Quettil said, his eyes narrowing. The King shifted
from one leg to the other, winced, then nodded in appreciation as
the Doctor brought up a chair for him to sit in.</p>

<p>Feulecharo nodded towards the far corner of the room. 'I was in
the corridor, behind that door, sirs, earlier.'</p>

<p>'Doing what, might one ask?' Quettil said.</p>

<p>Feulecharo swallowed. He glanced at Droythir and Uoljeval, who
had been brought forward again to the side of the table, their arms
still held behind them. 'I had been asked by the Duchess to . . .'
Feulecharo licked his lips. 'To follow the Duke and see what he was
doing.'</p>

<p>'And you followed him here?' Adlain said. He knew Feulecharo a
little, and sounded purposeful but not unkind.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir. With the two young people.' Feulecharo glanced at
Droythir and Uoljeval, neither of whom responded. 'The Duchess
thought perhaps there was some arrangement between the young lady
and the Duke. I watched them enter this withdrawing room, and found
my way to the corridor outside. I thought I might hear something,
or see something through the keyhole, but it was blocked.'</p>

<p>'By a key?' Adlain asked.</p>

<p>'I think not, sir. Rather by the little shutter on the far side.
However,' Feulecharo said, 'I had with me a small metal mirror and
thought to see something under the bottom of the door.'</p>

<p>'And did you?' Quettil asked.</p>

<p>'Only a single light, like a candle flame, Duke Quettil. I could
hear the young man and woman making the sounds of love, and sense
some movement, but that was all.'</p>

<p>'And when the Duke was stabbed?' Polchiek asked.</p>

<p>Feulecharo took a deep breath. 'Just before that, sir, I think,
I was hit on the back of the head, and rendered unconscious. I
imagine for just a few minutes.' He turned and held his hair up at
the back, exposing a scab of glistening, half-dried blood and a
large lump.</p>

<p>The King looked at the Doctor, who went forward and looked at
the wound. 'Oelph,' she said. 'Some water, please. And a napkin or
something similar. Is that a bottle of spirit wine there on the
floor? That, too.'</p>

<p>Feulecharo sat in a seat while his wound was cleaned and
inspected. Adlain looked closely at the injury. 'That certainly
looks to me like it might knock a fellow out for a moment or two,'
he said. 'You would agree, Doctor?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said.</p>

<p>'And when you woke up, what was there to be seen then?' Polchiek
asked Feulecharo.</p>

<p>'Sir, I could hear the commotion in the room and people crying
out. There was nobody else in the corridor where I was. I was very
dizzy and went to the privy to be sick, then I went to find the
Duchess, and that was when I heard that the Duke had been
murdered.'</p>

<p>Adlain and Polchiek exchanged looks. 'You did not sense anybody
behind you when you were hit?' Adlain asked.</p>

<p>'No, sir,' Feulecharo said, wincing as the Doctor dabbed some
spirit wine on his wound. 'I was concentrating too sorely on the
mirror.'</p>

<p>'This mirror . . .' Polchiek began.</p>

<p>'It is here, sir. I had the presence of mind to retrieve it
before I made my way to the privy.' Feulecharo dug into a pocket
and pulled out a coin-sized piece of highly polished metal. He
handed it to Polchiek, who passed it round the other men.</p>

<p>'Is the Duchess Walen a particularly jealous woman, would you
say, Feulecharo?' Adlain asked, turning the small mirror over in
his fingers.</p>

<p>'Not especially so, sir,' Feulecharo said. He sounded awkward,
though that may just have been because the Doctor was holding his
head forward while she completed the cleaning of his wound.</p>

<p>'You have told us everything of the truth, have you not,
Feulecharo?' the King asked gravely.</p>

<p>Feulecharo looked at him as best he could with his head still
bent forward by the Doctor. 'Oh, yes, your majesty.'</p>

<p>'When you were hit, Feulecharo,' the Doctor said, letting go of
his head, 'did you fall against the door, or to the floor?'</p>

<p>Quettil made a tutting noise. Feulecharo thought for a moment.
'I woke up resting against the door, ma'am,' he said, then looked
at Adlain and, the others.</p>

<p>'So if somebody had opened the door into the room,' the Doctor
said, 'you would have fallen in too.'</p>

<p>'I suppose I would have, ma'am. I would have required being put
back into the same position after it had been closed again.'</p>

<p>'You are hiding nothing from us, young man?' Quettil asked.</p>

<p>Feulecharo seemed to be about to speak, but then hesitated. I
had thought him more intelligent than that, but perhaps the blow to
his head had addled his brains.</p>

<p>'What?' the King said sternly.</p>

<p>'Your majesty, sirs,' Feulecharo said in a dry, strained-sounding
voice. 'The Duchess thought the Duke might be seeing the young lady
here. That was what exercised her jealousy. She would not have
minded so much, perhaps not have minded at all if she had known it
was only to . . . to watch others.' Feulecharo looked round the men
in the room, avoiding my eyes and the Doctor's. 'Why, she would
have laughed to have known what was going on in here, sirs. No
more. And there is nobody she would trust more than me. I know her,
sirs. She would not cause such a thing to be done.' He licked his
lips and swallowed hard again, then looked despondently at the
mound of table cloth covering the body of the Duke.</p>

<p>Quettil opened his mouth to say something, but the King,
watching Adlain and Polchiek, said, 'Thank you, Feulecharo.'</p>

<p>'I think Feulecharo should stay here, sir,' Adlain said to the
King. 'Guard Commander Polchiek might send men to his quarters to
search for a weapon, or the missing key for the door.' The King
nodded, and Polchiek spoke to some of the servant-guards.
'Perhaps,' Adlain added, 'the Guard Commander would open the door
again and we'll see if young Feulecharo left any blood there.'</p>

<p>The guards went off to search Feulecharo's room. Polchiek and
Adlain returned to the door.</p>

<p>The King looked at the Doctor and smiled. 'Thank you for all
your help, Vosill,' he said, with a nod. 'That will be all.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' the Doctor said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I heard later that they looked all through the Duchess'
apartment as well as Feulecharo's. Nothing was found. Some blood
was discovered on the outer surface of the door into the corridor,
and on the floor beneath. A good part of the rest of the palace was
searched soon afterwards for the murder weapon, but it was never
discovered. The missing key turned up, innocently enough as far as
could be told, in the key cabinet of the palace seneschal.</p>

<p>Master, I knew Feulecharo and did not think him capable of the
killing of the Duke. The King may have been overly lenient in not
allowing the two lovers Droythir and Uoljeval to be put to the
question by Ralinge (though I believe both were shown the chamber
and had the instruments of excruciation explained to them), but I
do not believe any further truthful information would or could have
been extracted from them.</p>

<p>Polchiek might have preferred that a scapegoat was found, and
Quettil fumed and raged in private for moons afterwards, they say,
but apart from taking one of Polchiek's two small estates away from
him, he could do no more. Polchiek had filled the ball with extra
guards and by all accounts done all he could to ensure that nothing
untoward occurred.</p>

<p>Feulecharo was lucky, I think, that he was the third son of one
of Walen's more wealthy barons. Had he been of more lowly birth,
instead of just two sickly brothers away from a not inconsiderable
title, he might have found himself enjoying the hospitality of
Master Ralinge himself. As it was, it was generally accepted that
his good family name made it almost unthinkable that he could have
had anything more to do with the murder of the Duke than he had
claimed.</p>

<h3 class="chapter">16. THE BODYGUARD</h3>

<p>'I wish I could go too, Mr DeWar. Can't you ask my father? He
thinks you're clever.'</p>

<p>DeWar looked embarrassed. Perrund smiled indulgently at him.
From his pulpit the chief eunuch Stike looked down, fat and
frowning. DeWar wore riding boots. He carried a hat, and a heavy
black cape lay folded over the couch at his side next to a pair of
saddle bags. The Protector had decided it was time to take personal
command of the faltering war in Ladenscion.</p>

<p>'You're better off here, Lattens,' DeWar told the boy, and
reached out to ruffle his red-blond hair. 'You have to get well.
Being ill is like being attacked, you see? Your body is like a
great fortress that has been besieged by invaders. You've repelled
them, you've seen them off, but you have to be good, and marshal
your forces and rebuild the walls, refurbish your catapults, clean
your cannons, restock your armouries. Do you see? Only if your
father feels that great fortress is going to be all right can he
leave it to go and fight the war. So that is your duty. To keep
getting better. To get well.</p>

<p>'Of course your father would rather stay here with you if he
could, but he's like a father to all his men, too, you see? They
need his help and guidance. So he has to go to them. You must stay,
and help your father win the war by getting better, by repairing
the great fortress. It is your duty, as a soldier. Do you think you
can do that?'</p>

<p>Lattens looked down at the cushions he sat upon. Perrund patted
his curls back into place again. He played with a loose thread of
gold at the corner of a cushion. 'Yes,' he said in a small voice,
not looking up. 'But I really would like to go with you and Father,
really I would.' He looked up at DeWar. 'Are you sure I can't
come?'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid so,' DeWar said quietly.</p>

<p>The boy sighed heavily and looked down again. DeWar smiled at
Perrund, who was looking at Lattens.</p>

<p>'Oh,' Perrund said. 'Come, sir. Is this the General Lattens who
won so well at catapults? You must do your duty, General. Your
father will be back before too long. And Mr DeWar.' She smiled at
DeWar.</p>

<p>'For all we know,' DeWar said, 'the war may be ended by the time
we get there. That is sometimes the way with wars.' He fiddled with
his big, waxed hat, then set it aside on his dark cape. He cleared
his throat. 'Did I tell you about when Sechroom and Hiliti parted?
When Sechroom went off to become a missionary?'</p>

<p>Lattens seemed not to hear for a moment, but then he rolled over
on his side and stopped humming and said, 'No, I don't think
so.'</p>

<p>'Well, one day the two friends had to part. Sechroom had made up
her mind that she would become a soldier-missionary, taking the
message of Lavishia to far-off lands and teaching the peoples there
the error of their ways. Hiliti had tried to talk his friend out of
this, still believing that it was the wrong thing to do, but
Sechroom was adamant.'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Determined.'</p>

<p>'Oh.'</p>

<p>'One day,' DeWar continued, 'not long before Sechroom was due to
leave, they went to one of their special places, which was on an
island. This island was a very wild place where people went to get
away from all the riches of Lavishia. There were no streams of wine
and sugar water, no ready-cooked game birds hanging in the
house-trees, no perfume fountains, no piles of sweet-rocks,
no&mdash;'</p>

<p>'People wanted to get away from sweet-rocks?' Lattens asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>'Yes, and from being able to fly, and from having hot water gush
from wash basins and from having servants pander to their every
whim, too. People are strange like that, Lattens. Give them every
comfort and they start to pine for the rougher life.'</p>

<p>Lattens frowned mightily at this, but did not protest further.
It was obvious he thought that the people of Lavishia, or perhaps
just all adults, must be quite mad.</p>

<p>'Sechroom and Hiliti,' DeWar said, 'went to the island as a sort
of holiday from all the luxuries they were used to. They left all
their servants behind and they even left behind the magic amulets
and jewels that protected them from harm and which let them call on
the local gods, and the two of them were left to fend for
themselves in the wilderness. They could still find fruit to eat
and water to drink, and they were able to make a shelter from the
giant leaves of trees. They had with them bows and arrows and a
pair of blow-pipes which fired poisoned darts, too. They had made
these before they had come on the holiday and were quite proud of
them They used the bows and blowpipes to go hunting for some of the
animals on the island, though the animals were not the cooperative
sort of animals they were used to, and they didn't want to be
killed and cooked and eaten, so they were quite good at keeping out
of the way of two people who were really very inexperienced
hunters.</p>

<p>'One day, when Sechroom and Hiliti had been out trying to find
some animals to shoot their poison darts at, but without success,
they were returning to their leaf-shelter, arguing and becoming
annoyed with each other. They were both bored and hungry and that
was probably one of the reasons that they were each so upset with
the other and blaming the other for spoiling the hunt. Sechroom
thought that Hiliti was too aggressive and wanted to kill the
animals just for the sake of it, for Hiliti was proud of his skills
as a bowman and a blowpiper and at hand-to-hand fighting, while
Hiliti secretly thought that Sechroom, who didn't like to kill
things, had deliberately made noises so that the animals they were
stalking would realise they were there and run away.</p>

<p>'Their route took them back over a steep-sided stream where
there was a natural bridge made by a fallen tree. It had been
raining quite a lot that day &mdash; that was another reason they were
miserable and arguing so much &mdash; and the stream below the
tree-bridge was in spate.'</p>

<p>'What's that?'</p>

<p>'It means the stream was swollen, full of water. So they started
to cross the tree bridge. Now, Hiliti thought about saying that
they should cross one at a time, but by then they had started out
across the tree, with him going first, and he thought if he turned
round and told Sechroom to go back
and wait, Sechroom would just get even angrier than she was
already, so he didn't say anything.</p>

<p>'Well, the tree-bridge gave way. It had been lying there rotting
away for many years no doubt, and the banks on either side had been
partially washed away by all the rain, so when the two of them put
their weight on it, it obviously decided that it was time to give
up the struggle and just succumb &mdash; ah, that means give in &mdash; to
gravity, and fall into the stream.</p>

<p>'So down it tumbled, breaking in the middle and bringing down
other bits of branches and a few rocks and a load of earth and so
on from either side just for good measure.'</p>

<p>'Oh no!' Lattens said, hand to his mouth. 'What happened to
Sechroom and Hiliti?'</p>

<p>'They fell down along with the tree. Hiliti was the luckier,
because the bit of the tree he was on took its time collapsing, and
he was able to hang on to it as it went down and throw himself on
to the bank before the trunk hit the water. He still ended up
tumbling into the stream, but he was all right.'</p>

<p>'But what about Sechroom?'</p>

<p>'Sechroom wasn't so lucky. The part of the tree trunk she was on
must have rolled as it fell, or she did, because she ended up
underneath it, trapped beneath the water.'</p>

<p>'Did she drown?' Lattens looked very concerned now, both his
hands at his mouth. He started to suck one thumb.</p>

<p>Perrund put her arm round him and brought his hands away from
his mouth. 'Now come, don't forget this is just before Sechroom
goes off to become a soldier-missionary.</p>

<p>'Yes, but what happened?' Lattens asked anxiously.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Perrund said. 'And why didn't the tree trunk float?'</p>

<p>'Most of its length was still on the steep bank,' DeWar told
her. 'The bit sticking into the water trapping Sechroom wasn't
enough to float. Anyway, Hiliti could see one of his cousin's boots
sticking up out of the water on the far side of the tree and waving
around. Hiliti swam and pulled himself through the water and over
the rocks and the broken branches to get to Sechroom, who he
realised was trapped under the water. He dived down. There was just
enough light for him to see Sechroom struggling desperately, trying
to push the tree trunk off her leg, but making no impression on it,
because it was very big and heavy. Even as Hiliti watched, he saw a
last few bubbles of air float out of Sechroom's mouth and be swept
away in the strong current. Hiliti came back up to the surface,
took a deep lungful of air and then went back down again and put
his mouth over his cousin's and blew the air into Sechroom's mouth,
so that she could live a little longer.</p>

<p>'Hiliti tried to push the tree trunk off Sechroom too, but it
was too heavy. He thought that perhaps if he could find a strong
enough, and a long enough lever, then perhaps he could take the
weight off Sechroom's leg, but that would take a while. Meantime,
Sechroom must be almost out of breath again. Hiliti took another
gulp of air and dived back down. Again, the bubbles came out of
Sechroom's mouth and again Hiliti gave his friend his own air.</p>

<p>'By now Hiliti could see that this could not go on much longer.
The water was cold enough to be sapping his warmth and strength
away, arid he was becoming exhausted and starting to gasp for air
himself.</p>

<p>'Then he thought of the blow-pipe. His own had been washed away
by the stream when he'd fallen in, but he had seen Sechroom's when
he'd first dived down, still slung over her back and partly trapped
under her. Hiliti dived down, blew more air into Sechroom's mouth,
then took hold of Sechroom's blow-pipe and pulled and twisted with
all his might until it slithered out from underneath her. He had to
return to the surface to gasp for air, but then he went back down
and pointed to the pipe, and Sechroom took it into her mouth.</p>

<p>'But the situation was not yet saved. Sechroom had to spit the
pipe out again, because there was too much water still inside it.
Hiliti took the pipe to the surface, let the water out, held his
hand over the end this time, and went back down.</p>

<p>'Finally, Sechroom could breathe. Hiliti waited a few breaths to
make sure Sechroom was going to be all right for the moment, then
he got out of the stream and looked for a lever. Eventually he
found a branch straight and stout enough to do the job, he hoped,
and he waded back into the river and went under, setting the branch
under the fallen tree trunk and over the top of a rock.</p>

<p>'Well, at last it worked. The lever almost snapped, and when the
tree trunk moved it hurt Sechroom's broken leg, but she was freed,
and she floated to the surface, and Hiliti was able to lift her out
of the stream and get her to the shore. The blow-pipe floated away
downstream.</p>

<p>'It was just as big a struggle for Hiliti to get Sechroom to the
top of the bank, because of course Sechroom was almost helpless
with her badly broken leg.'</p>

<p>'Did a surgeon have to cut her leg off?' Lattens asked,
squirming on the couch, his eyes wide.</p>

<p>'What? Oh, no. No. Anyway, eventually Hiliti got Sechroom to
the top of the bank. He was so exhausted he had to leave his
friend there and return to their camp by himself, but there was a .
. . a signal fire near the camp which he was able to light and that
drew the attention of people who came and rescued them.'</p>

<p>'So Sechroom was all right?' Lattens asked.</p>

<p>DeWar nodded. 'She was indeed. Hiliti was regarded as a hero by
all, and after Sechroom's leg was mended, but before she left to
become a missionary, she went back to the island where it had
happened and searched the length of the stream down from the
collapsed tree-bridge until she found the two blow-pipes, lodged
amongst rocks in different parts of the stream. She cut a piece off
the end of the one that had been hers, and which had saved her
life, and she presented it on a little ribbon to Hiliti at a party
which their friends held to wish Sechroom well, on the evening of
her leaving to become a missionary. It was the sign that what had
happened by the other river, when Hiliti had let Sechroom fall into
the water by the side of the waterfall &mdash; remember? &mdash; it was a sign,
they both knew, that that didn't matter any more, that Sechroom had
forgiven Hiliti. The little wooden ring was a bit too big to be
worn as a ring, which was unfortunate, but Hiliti told Sechroom he
would treasure it for ever, and he did, and he does, and as far as
anybody knows, it is with him to this day.'</p>

<p>'Whereabouts did Sechroom go?' Lattens asked.</p>

<p>'Who knows?' DeWar said, spreading his hands. 'Perhaps she came
here. She and Hiliti knew of . . . of the Empire, and Haspidus.
They talked about it, argued over it. She may have been here, for
all anyone knows.'</p>

<p>'Did Sechroom ever return to see her friend?' Perrund asked,
taking Lattens on to her lap. He wriggled out again.</p>

<p>DeWar shook his head. 'No,' he said. 'A few years after Sechroom
left, so did Hiliti, and he lost touch completely with Lavishia and
all the people he knew there. Sechroom could have returned there by
now, but Hiliti will never know. He exiled himself from the
luxuries of Lavishia for ever. Sechroom and Hiliti will never meet
again.'</p>

<p>'How sad,' Perrund said. Her voice was low, and her expression
sombre. 'Never to see one's friends and family again.'</p>

<p>'Well,' DeWar began, but then looked up to see one of the
Protector's aides signalling him from the doorway. He ruffled
Lattens' hair and stood slowly up, lifting his hat, bags and cloak.
'I'm afraid I don't have any more time, young general. You must say
goodbye to your father now. Look.'</p>

<p>UrLeyn, dressed in a very fine riding outfit, strode into the
room. 'Where's that boy of mine?' he shouted.</p>

<p>'Father!' Lattens ran to him and threw himself up into his
arms.</p>

<p>'Oof! My, what a weight you're getting!' UrLeyn looked over to
DeWar and Perrund, and winked. He sat down with the boy on a couch
near the doors and they huddled together.</p>

<p>Perrund stood up, by DeWar's side. 'Well, sir. You must promise
me faithfully you'll take good care of both the Protector and
yourself,' she told him, raising her face to him. Her eyes looked
bright. 'I shall be most cross should any harm befall either of
you, and brave though you may be, you are not so brave, I hope, as
to risk my ire.'</p>

<p>'I shall do all I can to make sure we both return safely,' DeWar
told her. He rearranged his cloak, hat and bags, putting one on one
arm, the other two on the other, before putting the saddle bags
over his shoulder and the hat over his head to hang down against
his back on its cord.</p>

<p>Perrund watched this shuffle of impedimenta with a sort of sad
amusement. She put her good hand on his, stilling him. 'Take care,'
she said softly. Then she turned and went to sit where she could
see UrLeyn and he could see her.</p>

<p>DeWar looked at her for a moment as she sat there,
straight-backed in her long red gown, her face calm and beautiful,
then he turned away too, and walked to the doors.</p>

<h3 class="chapter">17. THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p>Master, a killer for Duke Walen was of course eventually
procured. It could not be otherwise. The murder of one so prominent
cannot simply be left unavenged. As surely as the heir to a vacant
title of note must be found, such an event leaves a hole in the
fabric of society which has to be repaired with the life of
another. It is a vacuum into which some soul must be sucked, and
the soul in this case was a poor mad fellow from the city of Mizui
who with every appearance of happiness and even fulfilment
willingly threw himself into that void.</p>

<p>His name was Berridge, a one-time tinder-box maker of some age
who was well known as a mad fellow in the city. He lived under the
city's bridge with a handful of other desperates, begging for money
in the streets and scavenging the market for discarded or rotten
food. When the death of Duke Walen was made public knowledge in
Mizui on the day following the masked ball, Berridge presented
himself at the sheriff's office and made a full confession.</p>

<p>This was not a cause for any great surprise on the sheriff's
part, as Berridge routinely claimed responsibility for any murder
in or near the city for which there was no obvious culprit, and
indeed for some where the murderer could not have been more
obvious. His protestations of guilt in court, despite the fact that
a husband of known viciousness had been discovered comatose with
drink in the same locked room as the body of his butchered wife
with the knife still clutched in his bloody hand, were the cause of
much hilarity amongst that part of the populace which treats the
King's courts as a form of free theatre.</p>

<p>Normally, Berridge would have been thrown out of the door and
into the dust of the street without the sheriff giving the matter a
second thought. On this occasion, however, due to the gravity of
the offence and the fact that Duke Quettil had only that morning
impressed upon the sheriff the extremity of his annoyance at a
second unsanctioned murder taking place within his jurisdiction
within so short a time, the sheriff thought the better of treating
the madman's claims to such automatic dismissal.</p>

<p>To his immense surprise and satisfaction, Berridge was
incarcerated in the town jail. The sheriff had a note sent to Duke
Quettil informing him of this swift action, though he did think to
include mention of such confessions being a habitual feature of
Berridge's behaviour and that it was correspondingly unlikely that
Berridge was really the culprit.</p>

<p>Guard Commander Polchiek sent word to the sheriff to keep
Berridge in jail for the time being. When a half-moon had passed
and no progress had been made discovering the murderer, the Duke
instructed the sheriff to make further investigations into
Berridge's claim.</p>

<p>Sufficient time had passed for neither Berridge nor any of his
under-bridge-dwelling companions to have any recollection
whatsoever of the movements of any of them on the day and evening
of the masked ball, save that Berridge insisted he had left the
city, climbed the hill to the palace, entered the private chambers
of the Duke and murdered him in his bed (this quickly changed the
better to fit the facts when Berridge heard that the Duke had been
killed in a room just off the ballroom, while awake).</p>

<p>In the continuing absence of any more likely suspect, Berridge
was sent to the palace, where Master Ralinge put him to the
question. What good this was supposed to do other than to prove
that Duke Quettil was serious about the matter and his appointees
thorough in their investigations is debatable. Berridge presented
no satisfying challenge at all to the Duke's chief torturer and
from what I heard suffered relatively little, though still enough
to unhinge his feeble brain still further.</p>

<p>By the time he appeared before the Duke himself to be tried for
the Duke's murder, Berridge was a thin, bald, shaking wreck whose
eyes roved about with seemingly complete independence from each
other. He mumbled constantly yet spoke almost no intelligible words
and had confessed not only to the murder of Duke Walen but also to
that of King Beddun of Tassasen, Emperor Puiside and King Quience's
father King Drasine, as well as claiming to be responsible for the
fiery sky rocks which had killed whole nations of people and
ushered in the present post-Imperial age.</p>

<p>Berridge was burned at the stake in the city's square. The
Duke's heir, his brother, set the fire himself, though not before
having the sad wretch strangled first, to spare him the pain of the
fire.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rest of our stay in the Yvenage Hills passed relatively
uneventfully. There was an air of unsettled concern and even
suspicion about the palace for some time, but that gradually
dissipated. There were no more unexplained deaths or shocking
murders. The King's ankle healed. He went hunting and fell off his
mount again, though without incurring any injuries beyond
scratches. His health seemed to improve generally, perhaps under
the influence of the clear mountain air.</p>

<p>The Doctor found she had little to do. She walked and rode in
the hills, sometimes with me at her side, sometimes, at her own
insistence, alone. She spent some considerable time in Mizui city,
treating orphans and other unfortunates at the Paupers' Hospital,
comparing notes with the local mid-wives and discussing remedies
and potions with the local apothecaries. As our time at Yvenir went
on, a number of casualties from the war in Ladenscion arrived in
the city, and the Doctor treated a few of those as best she could.
She had little success at first in trying to meet with the doctors
of the town, until with the King's permission she invited them to
his counsel chamber, and had him briefly meet with them before he
went off to hunt.</p>

<p>She accomplished less than she'd hoped to, I think, in terms of
changing some of their ways, which she found even more old
fashioned and indeed potentially dangerous to their patients than
those of their colleagues in Haspide.</p>

<p>Despite the King's obvious health, he and the Doctor still
seemed to find excuses to meet. The King worried that he might run
to fat, as his father had done in later years, and so consulted the
Doctor on his diet. This seemed bizarre to those of us for whom
growing fat was a sure sign that one was well fed, lightly worked
and had achieved a maturity beyond the average, but then perhaps
this showed that there was a degree of truth to the rumours that
the Doctor had put some strange ideas into the King's head.</p>

<p>Tongues also wagged concerning the fact the Doctor and the King
spent so much time together. As far as I know nothing of an
intimate nature took place between them during all this time. I had
been present at the Doctor's side on every occasion she had
attended the King, save for a couple of instances when I was too
ill to leave my bed, when I diligently undertook to discover
through my fellow assistants, as well as through certain servants,
what had transpired between the Doctor and the King.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that I missed nothing and have reported
everything that could possibly be of note to my Master thus
far.</p>

<p>The King commanded the Doctor's presence most evenings, and if
he had no obvious ailments, he would make a show of flexing his
shoulders and would claim with a small frown that there might be a
stiffness in one or other of them. The Doctor seemed perfectly
willing to act the masseuse, and would happily work her various
oils into the golden-brown skin of the King's back, kneading and
working her palms and knuckles down his spine, across the shoulders
and over the nape of his neck. Sometimes at such times they would
talk quietly, more often they would be silent, save for the King's
sporadic grunts as the Doctor loosened particularly tense knots of
muscles. I too kept silent, of course, unwilling to break the spell
that seemed to prevail on such candle-lit occasions, and afflicted
with an odd, sweet melancholy while I watched in envy as those
strong, slender fingers, glistening with perfumed oils, worked on
the King's yielding flesh.</p>

<p class="chapter"><em>*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>*</em></p>


<p>'You look tired this evening, Doctor,' the King said as she
massaged his upper back. He lay stripped to the waist on his wide,
canopied bed.</p>

<p>'Do I, sir?'</p>

<p>'Yes. What have you been up to?' The King looked round at her.
'You haven't taken a lover, have you, Vosill?</p>

<p>The Doctor blushed, which was not something she did often. I
think that every time I witnessed such an event we were in the
presence of the King. 'I have not, sir,' she said.</p>

<p>The King settled his chin back on his hands. 'Perhaps you
should, Doctor. You're a handsome woman. I can't think that you
would have other than a fair choice, if you so wished.'</p>

<p>'Your majesty flatters me.'</p>

<p>'No, I'm simply speaking the truth, as I'm sure you know.'</p>

<p>'I bow to your opinion, sir.'</p>

<p>The King looked round, straight at me. 'Isn't she, ah . . .
?'</p>

<p>'Oelph,' I said, gulping. 'Sir.'</p>

<p>'Well, Oelph,' the King said, raising his eyebrows. 'Don't you
think so? Isn't the good doctor a pleasing prospect? Don't you
think she would gladden the eye of any normal man?'</p>

<p>I swallowed. I looked at the Doctor, who glanced at me with a
look that might have been forbidding or even pleading.</p>

<p>'I'm sure, sir,' I began, 'that my mistress is most personable,
your majesty, sir,' I mumbled, feeling myself blush now.</p>

<p>'Personable? Is that all?' The King laughed, still looking at
me. 'But don't you think she is attractive, Oelph? Attractive,
comely, handsome, beautiful?'</p>

<p>'I'm sure she is all those things, sir,' I said, looking down at
my feet.</p>

<p>'There you are, Doctor,' the King said, settling his chin on his
hands once more. 'Even your young assistant agrees with me. He
thinks you're attractive. So, Doctor, are you going to take a lover
or not?'</p>

<p>'I think not, sir. A lover would take up time I might need to
devote to your good self.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm so well and fit these days I'm sure I could spare you
for the time it takes for a quick tumble or two each evening.</p>

<p>'Your majesty's generosity overwhelms me,' the Doctor said
dryly.</p>

<p>'There you go again, you see, Vosill? That damned sarcasm. My
father always said that when a woman started being sarcastic to her
betters it was a sure sign she wasn't being serviced properly.'</p>

<p>'What a fount of priceless wisdom he was to be sure, sir.</p>

<p>'He certainly was,' the King agreed. 'I think he'd have said you
needed a good tumbling. For your own good. Ouch,' he said as the
Doctor leant heavily on his spine with the heel of one hand.
'Steady, Doctor. Yes. You might even call it medicinal, or at
least, ah, what's that other word?'</p>

<p>'Irrelevant? Nosy? Impertinent?'</p>

<p>'Therapeutic. That's the word. Therapeutic.'</p>

<p>'Ah, that word.'</p>

<p>'I know,' the King said. 'What if I <em>commanded</em> you to
take a lover, Vosill, for your own good?'</p>

<p>'Your majesty's concern for my health is most cheering.</p>

<p>'Would you obey your King, Vosill? Would you take a lover if I
told you to?'</p>

<p>'I would be concerned what proof of my obeying such an
instruction would be required to satisfy my King, sir.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'd take your word on it, Vosill. And besides, I'm sure any
man who did bed you would be bound to brag about it.'</p>

<p>'Really, sir?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Unless he possessed a particularly jealous and unforgiving
wife. But would you do as I told you?'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked thoughtful. 'I take it I would be able to make
the choice myself, sir.'</p>

<p>'Oh, of course, Doctor. I am not determined to pimp for
you.'</p>

<p>'Then, yes, sir. Of course. With alacrity.'</p>

<p>'Good! Now then, I wonder if I should so command you.'</p>

<p>I had by this time raised my gaze from my feet, although my face
still felt flushed. The Doctor looked over at me and I smiled
uncertainly. She grinned.</p>

<p>'What if you did, sir,' she asked. 'And I refused?'</p>

<p>'Refused to obey a direct order from your King?' the King asked
with what sounded like genuine horror.</p>

<p>'Well, while I am entirely in your service and remain devoted to
your every good, sir, I am not, I believe, in a technical sense,
one of your subjects. I am a foreign national. Indeed, I am not a
subject at all. I am a citizen of the archipelagic republic of
Drezen and while I am content and indeed honoured to serve you
under and within the jurisdiction of your laws, I do not believe
that I am bound to obey your every whim as might somebody born
within the borders of Haspidus or who was born to parents who were
subjects of your realm.'</p>

<p>The King thought about this for a good few moments. 'Did you
once tell me you considered learning the law rather than medicine,
Doctor?'</p>

<p>'I believe I did, sir.'</p>

<p>'I thought so. Well, if you were one of my subjects and you
disobeyed me in such a matter, I would have you locked up until you
changed your mind, and if you did not change your mind that would
be unfortunate for you, because trivial though the issue itself
might be, the King's will must always be obeyed, and that is a
matter of the utmost gravity and importance.'</p>

<p>'However, I am not a subject of yours, sir. How then would you
deal with my mooted intransigence?'</p>

<p>'I suppose I would have to order you to leave my Kingdom,
Doctor. You would have to return to Drezen, or go elsewhere.'</p>

<p>'That would sadden me greatly, sir.'</p>

<p>'As it would me. But you can see that I would have no
choice.'</p>

<p>'Of course, sir. So I had better hope that you do not so
instruct me. Otherwise I had better prepare either to surrender
myself to a man, or for exile.'</p>

<p>'Indeed.'</p>

<p>'A hard choice for one who is, as you have observed with such
penetrating accuracy, sir, so opinionated and stubborn as I.'</p>

<p>'I am glad you are finally treating the subject with the gravity
it merits, Doctor.'</p>

<p>'Indeed. And what of yourself, sir, if I may enquire?'</p>

<p>'What?' the King said, his head coming up off his hands.</p>

<p>'Your majesty's intentions in the matter of a wife are of as
enormous consequence as my choice of a lover would be trifling. I
only wondered how much thought you had given to the matter, as we
are on the subject.'</p>

<p>'I think we are swiftly leaving the subject I thought we were
on.'</p>

<p>'I beg your majesty's pardon. But do you intend to marry soon,
sir?'</p>

<p>'I think that is none of your business, Doctor. That is the
business of the court, my advisors, the fathers of eligible
princesses or other ladies of rank to whom it would be sensible and
advantageous for me to be attached to, and myself.'</p>

<p>'Yet as you yourself pointed out, sir, one's health and
demeanour can be profoundly affected by a lack of . . . sensual
release. What might make sense for the political fortune of a state
might be catastrophic for the individual well-being of a King, if,
say, he married an ugly princess.'</p>

<p>The King looked round at the Doctor with an expression of
amusement. 'Doctor,' he said. 'I shall marry whomever I feel I
ought to marry for the good of my country and my heirs. If that
requires marrying an ugly woman then so be it.' His eyes seemed to
twinkle. 'I am the King, Vosill. The position carries with it
certain privileges you may have heard about. Within quite generous
limits, I may have the pleasure of whom I please, and I will not
suffer that to change just because I take a wife. I may marry the
least prepossessing princess in all the world, yet I'll warrant
that I'll notice no difference whatsoever in the frequency and
quality of my "sensual release".' He smiled broadly at her.</p>

<p>The Doctor looked awkward. 'But if you are to have heirs, sir,'
she began.</p>

<p>'Then I shall get sufficiently but not incapably drunk, make
sure the curtains are tightly closed and that the candles have been
snuffed out, and then I shall think of somebody else until the
proceedings reach a satisfactory conclusion, my dear doctor,' the
King said, a look of satisfaction on his face as he returned his
chin to his hands again. 'As long as the wench is fertile I ought
not to have to suffer that too often, wouldn't you say?'</p>

<p>'I'm sure that I could not say, sir.'</p>

<p>'Then take my word on it, and that of the girls who have borne
me children &mdash; and mostly boys, too, I might add.'</p>

<p>'Very well, sir.'</p>

<p>'Anyway, I do not order you to take a lover.'</p>

<p>'I am very grateful, sir.'</p>

<p>'Oh, it's not for your benefit, Vosill. It's just that I have
too much sympathy for any fellow you might take to your bed. I
don't doubt the principal part of the occasion would be pleasurable
enough, but then &mdash; Providence protect the unfortunate wretch &mdash; he'd
have to suffer your confounded conversation afterwards. Ouch!'</p>

<p class="chapter"><em>*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>*</em></p>


<p>I think, then, that there is only one more incident of note to
relate concerning our time in Yvenir palace. It was one I only
learned of later, some time after our return to Haspide, when news
of it was considerably overshadowed by events.</p>

<p>Master, the Doctor, as I said, often went for rides and walks in
the hills by herself, sometimes departing at Xamis dawn and staying
away until its dusk. This seemed just as eccentric behaviour to me
as it did to anybody else, and even when the Doctor had the good
sense to ask for my company, I remained perplexed at her motives.
Walks were the most strange. She would walk for hour after hour,
like some peasant. She took with her small and not so small books
which she had purchased at great expense in Haspide and which were
filled with drawings, paintings and descriptions of the flora and
fauna native to the area, and would watch intently as birds and
small animals crossed our path, observing them with an intensity
which seemed unnatural given that she was not interested in hunting
them.</p>

<p>Rides were less enervating, though I think she only resorted to
a mount when the journey she proposed to make was too long to
consider undertaking on foot (she would never stay out
overnight).</p>

<p>For all my mystifiication at these excursions and my annoyance
at being forced to walk all day, I came to enjoy them. I was
expected to be at the Doctor's side, both by her and by my Master,
and so felt no guilt that I was doing other than my duty.</p>

<p>We tramped or rode in silence, or spoke of inconsequential
things, or about medicine or philosophy or history or a hundred
other matters, we stopped to eat or observe an animal or a fine
view, we consulted books and tried to decide whether the animals we
were looking at were those described, or if the book's author had
been overly fanciful, we attempted to decipher the rough maps that
the Doctor had copied from those in the library, we stopped
woodsmen and bondagers to ask the way, we collected feathers,
flowers, small stones and shells and eggshells, and returned
eventually to the palace precincts having done nothing of any real
consequence, yet with my heart full of joy and my head swimming
with a sort of wild delight.</p>

<p>I soon came to wish that she would take me on all her
excursions, and only when we returned to Haspide did I wish
bitterly that I had done something I had thought about doing often
when we were at Yvenir and the Doctor was making her solo
expeditions. What I wished I had done was follow her. I wish that I
had trailed her, tracked her, secretly kept watch on her.</p>

<p>What I heard, moons later in Haspide, was that two of my fellow
palace juniors did chance upon the Doctor while she was alone. They
were Auomst and Puomiel, pages to Baron Sermil and Prince Khres
respectively, and fellows I knew only distantly and in truth
without liking at all. They had reputations as bullies, cheats and
rakes, and certainly both boasted of the heads they had broken, the
servants they had swindled at cards and the successes they had had
with town girls. Puomiel was rumoured to have left one junior page
at the brink of death the year before after the young fellow had
protested to his master that the elder page was extorting money
from him. It had not even been a fair fight. The lad had been
jumped from behind and coshed senseless. Brazenly, Puomiel did not
even deny this &mdash; not to us, anyway &mdash; thinking it would make us fear
him more. Auomst was marginally the less unpleasant of the two, but
by general agreement only because he lacked the imagination.</p>

<p>Their story was that they had been out in the woods, some good
distance from the palace, near dusk one particularly warm evening.
They were making their way back towards Yvenir with some game in
their bags, happy at their poaching and looking forward to their
evening meal.</p>

<p>They chanced upon a royal xule, a rare enough animal in any
event, but this one, they swore, was pure white. It moved through
the forest like a swift, pale ghost, and they, dropping their bags
and readying their bows, followed it as quietly as they were
able.</p>

<p>Neither could really have thought what they were going to do if
they did find themselves in a position to bring the beast down.
They could not have told anybody they had killed the animal, for
the hunting of the xule is a royal prerogative, and the size of the
thing would have prevented them carrying it to a dishonest butcher,
supposing one brave enough to risk the royal wrath could have been
found. But they moved off after it nevertheless, carried along by
some instinct to hunt that is perhaps bred into us.</p>

<p>They did not catch the xule. It startled suddenly as it neared a
small tree-surrounded lake high in the hills and took off at a run,
putting itself beyond even the most hopeful of bow shots within a
few heartbeats.</p>

<p>The two pages, just achieving the summit of a small ridge in
time to see this happen through a screen of small bushes, were
disheartened at losing the animal. That dissatisfaction was almost
instantly relieved by what they saw next.</p>

<p>A startlingly beautiful and perfectly naked woman waded out of
the lake and stared in the direction the white xule had taken when
it fled.</p>

<p>Here then was the cause of the animal taking off at such a rate,
and here too, perhaps, was something even more fit to be hunted
down and enjoyed. The woman was tall and dark haired. Her legs were
long, her belly was a little too flat to be truly beautiful, but
her breasts, while not especially large, looked firm and high.
Neither Auomst or Puomiel recognised her at first. But it was the
Doctor. She turned away from where the xule had dashed away through
the trees and reentered the water, swimming with the ease of a fish
straight towards the two young men.</p>

<p>She came ashore just beneath where they lay. It was here, they
realised, that she had left her clothes. She stepped out of the
water and began to dry herself with her hands, facing out towards
the water, her back to them.</p>

<p>They each looked at the other. They did not need to speak. Here
was a woman, by herself. She had no escort, no companion, and she
was, as far as they both knew, without a husband or a champion at
the court. Again, neither stopped to think that in fact she did
have a champion at the court, and he was without equal or better.
This pale body exposed before them excited them even more than the
one they had just lost sight of, and an instinct even deeper than
that of hunting flooded their hearts, taking them over and
extinguishing all rational thought.</p>

<p>It was dark beneath the circling trees and the birds were
calling all around, alerted by the flight of the xule, and so
providing sufficient noise to mask even a clumsy approach.</p>

<p>They might knock her out, or surprise her and blindfold her. She
might never even see them, in other words, and they might be able
to ravish her without risk of discovery and punishment. That they
had been led here by the xule seemed like a sign from the forest
gods of old. They had been delivered here by a creature close to
myth. The opportunity was too good to ignore.</p>

<p>Puomiel took out a pouch of coin he had in the past used as a
cosh. Auomst nodded.</p>

<p>They slipped out of the bushes and made their way stealthily
down through the shadows between a few small intervening trees.</p>

<p>The woman was singing softly to herself. She completed drying
herself with a small kerchief which she then wrung out. She stooped
to pick up her shirt, her buttocks like two pale moons. Still
facing away from the two men, who were now only a few steps behind
her, she held the shift over her head and then let it fall down
over her. For a few moments she was and would be blind, pulling the
garment down over herself. Auomst and Puomiel both knew this was
the moment. They sprang forward. They sensed the woman stiffen, as,
perhaps, she heard them at last. Her head might have started to
turn, still caught inside the folds of the shirt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They woke with aching heads in the darkness of a night full save
for Foy and Jairly, shining down like two grey reproachful eyes
upon the calm, still waters of the hidden lake.</p>

<p>The Doctor was gone. They each had bumps the size of eggs on the
backs of their heads. Their bows had been taken and, most oddly of
all, the blades of their knives had been twisted, bent right round
and made a knot of.</p>

<p>None of us could understand that at all. Ferice, the armourer's
assistant, swore that treating metal like that was next to
impossible. He tried to bend knives similar to Auomst and Puomiel's
in a like manner and found that they broke almost immediately. The
only way to make them behave in such a fashion was to heat them to
a yellow-white heat and then manipulate them, and that was hard
enough. He added that he had received a boxing about the ears from
the armourer for such assiduous experimentation, to teach him not
to waste valuable weapons.</p>

<p>I was suspected, though I did not know it at the time. Auomst
and Puomiel assumed that I had been with the Doctor, either
guarding her with her knowledge, or spying on her without it. Only
the testimony of Feulecharo, whom Jollisce and I had been helping
to sort through some of Duke Walen's possessions at the time, saved
me from a coshing.</p>

<p>When eventually I did discover what had happened I did not know
what to think, save that I wished that I had been there, either to
guard or to spy. I would have fought both of those miserable
ruffians to the death to protect the Doctor's honour, but at the
same time I would have gladly surrendered my own for a single
furtive glimpse of her such as they had been afforded.</p>

<h3 class="chapter">18. THE BODYGUARD</h3>

<p>The city of Niarje is conventionally supposed to lie six days'
ride from Crough, the capital of Tassasen. The Protector and his
company of fresh troops arrived there in four, and were
appropriately tired after their long days in the saddle. It was
decided they would rest in the city while they waited for the heavy
artillery pieces and siege engines to catch up with them, and for
fresh word from the war in Ladenscion to arrive. That word soon
appeared in the form of coded messages from Duke Ralboute, and was
not good.</p>

<p>The barons' forces were proving far better trained, more
comprehensively equipped and reliably supplied than had been
anticipated. Cities would not quickly be starved into submission.
Fresh defences encircled almost all of them. The troops manning
those defences were not the usual rabble but rather gave every
indication of having been drilled to the highest standard. Partisan
forces harried the Protectorate's supply lines, sacking camps,
ambushing wagon trains, taking weapons meant to be directed at them
for their own use and forcing troops needed at the front to attach
themselves to each of the supply caravans. General Ralboute had
himself nearly been killed or captured in a daring night raid which
had issued from the besieged city of Zhirt. Only luck and some
desperate hand-to-hand fighting had prevented disaster. The general
himself had had to draw sword and was within one defending aide of
having to join the fray.</p>

<p>We are told that one of the situations a soldier craves to
engineer for his enemy, and dreads being caught in himself, is that
of the pincer movement. So it can only be imagined what UrLeyn felt
when he was caught in just such a plight in Niarje, not by the
attack of enemy troops, but by information. The intelligence that
the war in Ladenscion was going so ill arrived just half a day
before news came from the opposite direction that was, if anything,
even worse, and also concerned illness.</p>

<p>UrLeyn seemed to shrink in on himself. His hand holding the
letter fell, and the letter itself fluttered to the ground.</p>

<p>He sat down heavily in his seat at the head of the dining table
in the old Ducal mansion in the centre of Niarje. DeWar, standing
just behind UrLeyn's seat, stooped and picked up the letter. He set
it, folded closed, by UrLeyn's plate.</p>

<p>'Sir?' asked Doctor BreDelle. The Protector's other companions,
all army officers, looked on, concerned.</p>

<p>'The boy,' UrLeyn said quietly to the doctor. 'I knew I should
not have left him, or should have had you stay with him, Doctor . .
.'</p>

<p>BreDelle stared at him for a moment. 'How poorly is he?'</p>

<p>'At death's door,' UrLeyn said, looking down at the letter. He
handed the letter to the doctor, who read it.</p>

<p>'Another seizure,' he said. BreDelle dabbed at his mouth with
his napkin. 'Shall I return to Crough, sir? I can start at first
light.'</p>

<p>The Protector stared down the table at nothing for a moment.
Then he seemed to rouse himself. 'Yes, Doctor. And I shall come
too.' The Protector looked apologetically at the other officers.
'Gentlemen,' he said, raising his voice and straightening his back.
'I must ask you to continue on to Ladenscion without me, for the
moment. My son is unwell. I hoped that I would contribute to our
eventual victory as soon as you will, but I fear that even if I
were to continue, my heart, and my attention, would still be drawn
back to Crough. I regret that the glory will be yours, unless you
contrive to extend the war. I will join you as soon as I can.
Please forgive me, and indulge the fatherly weakness of a man who,
at my age, should really be a grandfather.'</p>

<p>'Sir, of course!'</p>

<p>'I'm sure we all understand, sir.'</p>

<p>'We will do all we can to make you proud of us, sir.'</p>

<p>The protestations of support and understanding went on. DeWar
looked round the young, eager, earnest faces of the junior noblemen
gathered round the banqueting table with a feeling of dread and
foreboding.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Perrund? Is that you?'</p>

<p>'It is, young sir. I thought I'd come and sit by you.'</p>

<p>'Perrund, I can't see.'</p>

<p>'It is very dark. The doctor thinks you will better recover kept
away from the light.'</p>

<p>'I know, but still I cannot see. Hold my hand, will you?'</p>

<p>'You must not worry. Illness seems so terrible when you are
young, but these things pass.'</p>

<p>'Will it?'</p>


<p>'Of course.'</p>

<p>'Will I be able to see again?'</p>

<p>'Of course you will. Have no fear.'</p>

<p>'But I am frightened.'</p>


<p>'Your uncle has written to your father, telling him of your
condition. I imagine he will be coming home soon, in fact I'm sure
of it. He will give you some of his strength. He will drive away
all fear. You'll see.'</p>

<p>'Oh no! But he should be at the war. I am bringing him home when
he should be at the war, to win it for us.'</p>

<p>'Calm yourself, calm yourself. We could not keep your illness
from him. What would he have thought of us? He will want to be sure
that you are well. He will want to see you. I imagine he will bring
Doctor BreDelle with him, too.'</p>


<p>'And Mr DeWar?'</p>


<p>'And Mr DeWar. Where your father goes, he follows.'</p>

<p>'I can't remember what happened. What day is it?'</p>

<p>'It is the third of the old moon.'</p>

<p>'What happened? Did I start to shake as I did at the
shadow-players' show?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Your teacher said he thought you were trying to get out of
learning mathematics when you fell off your seat. He ran to get the
nurse and then Doctor AeSimil was sent for. He is doctor to your
uncle RuLeuin and General YetAmidous and very good. Very nearly as
good as Doctor BreDelle. He says you will be better, in good
time.'</p>


<p>'Does he?'</p>


<p>'He does. And he seems a most honest and trustworthy soul.'</p>


<p>'Is he better than Doctor BreDelle?'</p>


<p>'Oh, Doctor BreDelle must be better, because he is your father's
doctor, and your father deserves to have the best, for the good of
all of us.'</p>


<p>'Do you really think he will come back?'</p>

<p>'I am sure of it.'</p>

<p>'Will you tell me a story?'</p>

<p>'A story? I'm not sure I know any.'</p>


<p>'But everybody knows stories. Didn't you used to be told stories
when you were little? . . . Perrund?'</p>


<p>'Yes. Yes, I'm sure I was. Yes, I have a story.'</p>

<p>'Oh good . . . Perrund?</p>


<p>'Yes. Well. Let me see. Once upon a time . . . once upon a time
there was a little girl.'</p>


<p>'Yes?'</p>


<p>'Yes. She was rather an ugly child, and her parents did not like
or care for her at all.'</p>


<p>'What was her name??</p>

<p>'Her name? Her name was... Dawn.'</p>

<p>'Dawn. That's a pretty name.'</p>


<p>'Yes. Unfortunately she was not very pretty, as I have said. She
lived in a town she hated with parents she loathed. They made her
do all sorts of things they thought she ought to do, which she
hated, and they kept her locked up a lot of the time. They forced
her to wear rags and sacking, they refused to buy her shoes for her
feet or ribbons for her hair and they did not let her play with the
other children. They never told her any stories at all.'</p>


<p>'Poor Dawn!'</p>


<p>'Yes, she was a poor thing, wasn't she? She would cry herself to
sleep most nights, and pray to the old gods or appeal to Providence
to deliver her from such unhappiness. She wished that she could
escape from her parents, but because they kept her locked up she
could not. But then one day the fair came to town, with players and
stages and tents and jugglers and acrobats and fire-breathers and
knife-throwers and strong men and dwarves and people on stilts and
all their servants and performing animals. Dawn was fascinated by
the fair and wanted to see. it and be made happy by it, for she
felt that she had no life at all where she was, but her parents hid
her away. They did not want her to have fun watching all the
wonderful acts and shows, and they were worried that if people saw
that they had such an ugly child they would make fun of them and
perhaps even tempt her to leave to become an exhibit in their
freaks of nature show.'</p>

<p>'Was she really that ugly?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps not quite that ugly, but still they didn't want her to
be seen, so they hid her away in a secret place they had fashioned
in their house. Poor Dawn cried and cried and cried. But what her
parents did not know was that the people of the fair always sent
some of their performers round the houses in the town, to do little
acts of kindness, or to help out with chopping kindling, or to
clean up a yard, so that people would feel beholden to them and go
and see the fair. They did this in Dawn's town, and of course her
parents, being very mean, could not pass up the opportunity to have
some work done for free.</p>

<p>'They invited the performers into their house and had them tidy
it all up, though of course it was quite tidy already because Dawn
had done most of the work. While they were cleaning the house, and
even leaving little presents behind, for these were very kind and
generous performers &mdash; a clown, I think, and a fire-breather and a
knife-thrower &mdash; they heard poor Dawn crying in her secret prison, and
they released her and made her happy by their antics, and were very
kind to her. She felt appreciated and loved for the first time, and
tears of joy rolled down her face. Her bad parents had hidden
themselves in the cellar, and later on they ran away, embarrassed
at having been so cruel to Dawn.</p>

<p>'The performers from the fair gave Dawn her life back. She even
started to feel not so ugly, and was able to dress better than her
parents had let her dress, and feel clean and good. Perhaps, she
thought, she was not destined to be ugly and unhappy all her life,
as she had imagined. Perhaps she was beautiful and her life would
be full of happiness. Somehow just being with the performers made
her feel pretty, and she started to realise that they had made her
beautiful, that she had only been ugly because people had told her
she was ugly and now she was not. It was like magic.</p>

<p>'Dawn decided that she wanted to join the fair and go with the
performers, but they told her sadly that they could not let her do
that because if they did then people might think that they were the
sort of people who took little girls away from their families, and
their good name would suffer. They told her she ought to stay and
look for her parents. She saw the sense of what they were telling
her, and because she felt strong and capable and alive and
beautiful, she was able to wave goodbye to the fair when it left
and all the kind performers went away to take their happiness and
kindness to another town. And do you know what?'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'She did find her parents, and they were nice and good to her
for ever afterwards. She found a handsome young fellow, too, and
married him and had lots of babies and they lived happily ever
after. And, as well as all that, one day, she did catch up with the
fair, and was able to join it and be part of it and try to think of
a way to repay the performers for their earlier kindness.</p>

<p>'And that is the story of Dawn, an ugly, unhappy child who
became beautiful and happy.'</p>

<p>'Hmm. That is quite a good story. I wonder if Mr DeWar has any
more stories about Lavishia. They are a bit strange, but I think he
means well. I think I ought to sleep now. I &mdash; oh!'</p>

<p>'Ah, I'm sorry.'</p>

<p>'What was that? Water? On my hand . . .'</p>

<p>'It was just a happy tear. It is such a happy story. It makes me
cry. Oh, what are you&mdash; ?'</p>

<p>'Yes, it tastes of salt.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you are a charmer, young Master Lattens, to lick a lady's
tears up so! Let go my hand. I must . . . There. That's better. You
sleep now. Your father will be here soon, I'm sure. I'll send in
the nurse to make sure you're tucked in properly. Oh, do you need
this? Is this your comforter?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Thank you, Perrund. Good night.'</p>

<p>'Good night.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The palace concubine Yalde brought fruit and wine to the bath,
where YetAmidous, RuLeuin and ZeSpiole floated in the milky waters.
Terim and Herae, also concubines of Yalde's rank, sat naked by the
pool side, Terim with her long legs dangling in the water while
Herae brushed her long black hair.</p>

<p>Yalde placed the tray with the fruit bowl and the decanter near
YetAmidous' elbow, then stepped out of the loose gown she had worn
to visit the servants' quarters and slipped into the water. The
eyes of the other two men followed her movements but she ignored
them. She floated at YetAmidous' side and poured wine for him.</p>

<p>'So our little time of power may be drawing to an unexpectedly
early close,' ZeSpiole said. He brought one hand out of the water
and stroked the tawny calf of Terim's leg. She looked down and
smiled at him, though he did not see. Both Terim and Herae were
from Ungrian, and spoke only their own tongue and Imperial. The men
talked in Tassaseni.</p>

<p>'That might not be so bad,' RuLeuin said. 'The Protector told
BiLeth to report to me while he's away and I'm growing tired of
having to listen to that idiot pontificate on diplomatic niceties.
Part of me hopes UrLeyn does come back.'</p>

<p>'You think he will come back?' YetAmidous asked,
looking from RuLeuin to ZeSpiole. He accepted the goblet of wine
from Yalde and slurped at it, spilling some into the translucent
waters around his wide chest.</p>

<p>'I fear he will,' ZeSpiole said.</p>

<p>'Fear?' RuLeuin said. 'But&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, not because I am so attached to a temporary third of the
shadow of his power,' ZeSpiole said. 'But because I think it the
wrong thing for him to do for Tassasen.'</p>

<p>'The troops will go on without him, most of them, won't they?'
RuLeuin said.</p>

<p>'It would be better if he did bring some of them back with him,'
YetAmidous told the Guard Commander. 'There may be three of us to
share his authority but there are precious few troops at our
command, and when all fine words are finished with it's soldiers
and swords that make power. I have barely enough men to make the
city walls look lived in.'</p>

<p>'The Protector has always said that a populace which in general
assents to its ruling &mdash; and to its rulers &mdash; needs few sheriffs and
no troops,' ZeSpiole said.</p>

<p>'Easily said when you have several barracks full of soldiers to
agree with you,' YetAmidous said. 'But you will observe that it is
we who are allowed the privilege of testing our master's theory in
this regard, not he.'</p>

<p>'Oh, the people are happy enough,' ZeSpiole said. 'For the
moment.'</p>

<p>RuLeuin glanced at him. 'Your spies are sure of that then?'</p>

<p>'One does not spy on one's own people,' ZeSpiole informed him.
'One has, rather, conduits of communication which lead to the
common man. My guards mix with all sorts. They share their houses,
their streets, their taverns, and their views.'</p>

<p>'And they hear no grumblings?' YetAmidous asked sceptically,
pushing his goblet towards Yalde to be refilled.</p>

<p>'Oh, they hear constant grumblings. The day they stop hearing
grumblings I shall be sure that revolt is imminent.
But people grumble about this tax or that, or that the Protector
keeps such a large harem when many an honest working fellow can
hardly find a wife, or they grumble about the luxurious life led by
some of the Grand Aedile's generals,' ZeSpiole said, accepting a
piece of fruit from Terim with a broad smile.</p>

<p>RuLeuin smiled too.</p>

<p>YetAmidous drank greedily. 'We are to be reassured, then, that
we are in no immediate danger from the general populace,' he said.
'But what of our other frontiers? They are reduced to the minimum
or less. Where are the reinforcements if some other place makes war
on us?'</p>

<p>'The problem in Ladenscion will not last for ever,' RuLeuin
said, though he looked troubled. 'The troops will come home. With
the new men and machines now in Niarje, Simalg and Ralboute should
be able to bring it to a swift conclusion.'</p>

<p>'We were told that at the start,' YetAmidous reminded the other
man. 'We should all have gone then, all of us. We should have
crushed the barons with every force at our command.' The general
made a fist and brought it down on the surface of the water with a
splash. Yalde wiped soapy water from her eyes. YetAmidous drank,
then spat the wine out. 'There's water in here!' he told Yalde, and
tipped the wine over her head. He laughed, followed by the other
men. The wine stung her eyes a little, but she bowed her head.
YetAmidous pushed her head under the water, then let her bob up
once more. 'Here.' He pushed the goblet into her hands again. She
wiped it with a napkin and refilled it from the decanter.</p>

<p>'That might be obvious to all of us now,' ZeSpiole said. 'But it
was not then, to any of us. We all agreed that Simalg and
Ralboute's men would be more than ample for the job.'</p>

<p>'Well, they haven't been,' YetAmidous said, then tested the wine
by sloshing it round his mouth. 'The Protector should not have
entrusted so important a mission to those fops. Noble men, indeed!
They are no better than us. He is too impressed by their high
birth. They make war like children, like women. They spend too much
time talking with these barons when they should be fighting them.
Even when they do fight, they fight as though they're frightened of
getting their swords bloody. Too much finesse, not enough muscle.
All is ruse and subtlety. I have no time for such nonsense. These
barons are best met head on.'</p>

<p>'Your directness has always been your most engaging feature,
YetAmidous,' RuLeuin told him. 'I think my brother, if he ever had
a concern over the style of your generalship, only worried that
your assaults tended to be rather expensive in men.'</p>

<p>'Oh, what expense is that?' YetAmidous said, waving his free
hand. 'Too many of them are idle wretches from the gutter who'd
have met an early death anyway. They expect to return with
treasure. Usually all they bring back is the diseases they picked
up from the whores. Death in battle, a place in history,
remembering in a victory song . . . better than most of the scum
deserve. They're a crude tool and they're best used crudely, with
none of this effeminate feinting and playing around. Better to
attack straight and get it over with. These so-noble dandies
dishonour the whole business of war.' YetAmidous looked at the two
girls sitting at the pool side, then briefly at Yalde. 'I wonder
sometimes,' he said quietly to the two men, 'whether there is not
some other motive in the Dukes' inability to finish this war.'</p>

<p>'What?' RuLeuin said, frowning.</p>

<p>'I had assumed, with the Protector, that they were trying as
hard as they could,' ZeSpiole said. 'What do you mean,
General?'</p>

<p>'I mean that perhaps we are all being treated like fools, sir.
That Duke Ralboute and Duke Simalg are closer to the Barons of
Ladenscion than they are to us.'</p>

<p>'Apart from physically, obviously,' RuLeuin said, smiling but
looking awkward.</p>

<p>'Eh? Aye. Too damn close. Don't you see?' he asked, levering his
bulk away from the side of the bath. 'They go off to this war, they
pull in more and more troops, they delay and delay and stumble and
lose men and machines and come whining to us to help them out,
taking troops from the capital and our other frontiers, leaving the
way open to any bastard who might want to march in from outside.
Who knows what mischief they might have got up to if the Protector
had put himself in their midst? The boy about to die might save his
father's life, if he really is his father.'</p>

<p>'General,' RuLeuin said, 'have a care. The boy may not be about
to die. I have no doubt that in any event I am truly his uncle
through my brother, and the Generals Ralboute and Simalg have
always shown themselves to be good and true officers of the
Protectorate. They joined our cause long before it was sure to
succeed and could be said to have risked more than any of us in
supporting it, for they started out with much power and prestige
which they entirely risked by throwing their lot in with us.'
RuLeuin looked to ZeSpiole for support.</p>

<p>ZeSpiole had busied himself with a segment of fruit, burying
most of his lower face in it. He looked up at the other two men and
expressed surprise with his brows.</p>

<p>YetAmidous waved his hand in dismissal. 'All very fine, but the
fact remains they have not done as well as they were supposed to in
Ladenscion. They said they would triumph there in a few moons.
UrLeyn thought they would too. Even I thought that the job ought
not to be beyond them, if they applied themselves and threw their
troops to the front. But they have done badly. They have failed so
far. Cities have not been taken, siege engines and cannon have been
lost. Their progress has been halted by every stream, every hill,
every damn hedge and flower. I am simply asking why? Why are they
doing so badly? What can be the explanation, if it is not
deliberate? Might it not be some conspiracy? Might there not be
some collusion between the two sides of the war, to drag us and our
men in deeper and tempt the Protector himself forward to take part,
and then kill him?'</p>

<p>RuLeuin glanced at ZeSpiole again. 'No,' he told YetAmidous. 'I
think that is not the case, and nothing is accomplished by talking
like that. Give me some wine,' he said to Herae.</p>

<p>ZeSpiole grinned at YetAmidous. 'I must say, Yet,' he said.
'Your talent for suspicion is almost on a par with DeWar's.'</p>

<p>'DeWar!' YetAmidous snorted. 'I've never trusted him,
either.'</p>

<p>'Oh, this is getting preposterous!' RuLeuin said. He drained his
goblet and sank under the water, resurfacing to shake his head and
blow out his cheeks.</p>

<p>'What can DeWar be up to, do you think, Yet?' ZeSpiole asked,
with a smile. 'He certainly cannot wish our Protector dead, for he
has saved him from almost certain death on several occasions, the
last time being when each of us came closer to sending the
Protector into the arms of Providence than any assassin ever has.
You yourself came within a knuckle of sticking a quarrel straight
through UrLeyn's head.'</p>

<p>'I was aiming for that ort,' YetAmidous said, scowling. 'And I
almost got the thing, too.' He thrust his goblet out to Yalde
again.</p>

<p>'I'm sure you were,' ZeSpiole said. 'My own shot was more off
target. But you have not said what you suspect DeWar of.'</p>

<p>'I just don't trust him, that's all,' YetAmidous said, sounding
surly now.</p>

<p>'I would be more concerned that he does not trust you, Yet, old
friend,' ZeSpiole said, staring into YetAmidous' eyes.</p>

<p>'What?' YetAmidous spluttered.</p>

<p>'Well, he may have the feeling that you were trying to kill the
Protector that day, on the hunt, by the stream,' ZeSpiole said in a
quiet, concerned voice. 'He might be watching
you, you know. I would worry about that if I were in your position.
He is a sly, cunning hound, that one. His approach is silent and
his teeth are sharp as razors. I should not care to be the subject
of his suspicions, I'll tell you that. Why, I'd be sorely
frightened that I might wake up dead one morning.'</p>

<p>'What?' YetAmidous roared. He threw down the goblet. It splashed
into the milky water. He stood up, shaking with fury.</p>

<p>ZeSpiole looked over at RuLeuin, whose expression was anxious.
ZeSpiole put his head back and burst out laughing. 'Oh, Yet! You
are so easy to rile! I'm jesting with you, man. You could have
killed UrLeyn a hundred times by now. I know DeWar. He doesn't
think you're an assassin, you big oaf! Here. Have a fruit.'
ZeSpiole lifted a buncher and threw it across the bath at the other
man, who caught it and then, after a moment's confusion, laughed
too, sinking back into the swirling water and laughing
uproariously.</p>

<p>'Ha! Of course! Ah, you tease me like a hussy, ZeSpiole. Yalde!'
he said. 'This water's freezing. Get the servants to bring some
more hot. And bring more wine! Where's my goblet? What have you
done with it?'</p>

<p>The goblet, sunk in the bath in front of YetAmidous, had left a
red stain in the milky water, like blood.</p>

<h3 class="chapter">19. THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p>The summer passed. It was a relatively mild season throughout
the land, but especially so in the Yvenir hills, where the breezes
were either pleasantly cool or tolerably warm. Much of the time
passed with Seigen joining Xamis below the horizon each night,
trailing after it at first, while we performed the first part of
the Circuition, dancing almost in step with its senior during those
eventful and perplexing early moons at Yvenir, then preceding it by
gradually greater and greater increments for the rest of our stay,
which, happily, was devoid of significant incident.</p>

<p>When time came to pack up what needed to be packed up and store
what required storing, Seigen was anticipating the rise of the
greater sun by a good bell or so, providing the hills with a long
leading-dawn full of sharp, extended shadows when the day seemed
only half begun and birds chorused and some birds did not and the
tiny points that were the wandering stars could sometimes still be
seen in the violet sky if the moons were absent or low.</p>

<p>Our return to Haspide was accomplished with all the usual pomp
and ceremony. There were feasts and ceremonies and investitures and
triumphal parades through newly built gates and dignified
processions under specially commissioned arches and long speeches
by self-important officials and elaborate gift-givings and formal
conferments of old and new awards and titles and decorations and
any manner of other business, all of it wearying but all of it, I
was assured by the Doctor (somewhat to my surprise), necessary in
the sense that this sort of participatory ritual and use of shared
symbols helped to cement our society together. If anything, the
Doctor said, Drezen could have done with more of this sort of
thing.</p>

<p>En route back to Haspide, in the midst of all this ceremonial
 &mdash; much of it, I'd still insist, mere flummery &mdash; the King set up
numerous city councils, instituted more craft and professional
guilds and granted various counties and towns the privileged status
of burgh. This did not meet with the universal approval of the
Dukes and other nobles of the provinces concerned, but the King
seemed more energetic in finding ways to sweeten the medicine for
those who might lose out in this reshuffling of responsibilities
and control than he had on the way to Yvenir, and no less
cheerfully determined to have his way, not just because he was the
King but because he knew he was right and before too long people
would come to see things his way anyway.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'But there is no <em>need</em> for this, sir!'</p>

<p>'Ah, but there will be.'</p>

<p>'Sir, can we be so sure of that?'</p>

<p>'We can be as sure of it as we can that the suns will rise after
they have set, Ulresile.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, sir. Yet we wait until the suns do appear before we
rise. What you propose is to prepare for the day while it is still
the middle of the night.'</p>

<p>'Some things must be anticipated further in advance than
others,' the King told the younger man with a look of jovial
resignation:.</p>

<p>Young Duke Ulresile had opted to accompany the court back to
Haspide. He had developed his powers of speech and opinion
considerably over the summer since we had first encountered him in
the hidden garden behind Yvenir palace. Perhaps he was simply
growing up particularly quickly, but I think it was more likely
that his new-found garrulousness was largely the effect of living
in the same place as the royal court for a season.</p>

<p>We were camped on the Toforbian Plain, about halfway between
Yvenir and Haspide. Ormin, Ulresile and the new Duke Walen &mdash;
together with chamberlain Wiester and a fuss of servants &mdash; stood
with the King in a fabric-walled courtyard open to the sky outside
the royal pavilion while the Doctor bandaged the King's hands. Tall
flagpoles bent in a warm, harvest-scented breeze and the royal
standards flapped at each corner of the six-sided space, their
shadows moving sinuously over the carpets and rugs which had been
spread over the carefully levelled ground.</p>

<p>Our monarch was due to indulge in a formal stave-fight with the
old city-god of Toforbis, which would be represented as an
extravagantly hued multipede and played by a hundred men under a
long, hooped canopy. The spectacle was that of watching a man fight
with the awning of a tent, even if the awning was animated,
elongated, painted with scales and sported a giant head in the
shape of a giant toothed bird, but it was one of the rituals that
had to be endured for the sake of local custom and to keep the
regional dignitaries happy.</p>

<p>Duke Ulresile watched the Doctor's hands as she wound the
bandages round and round the King's fingers and palms. 'But sir,'
he said, 'why anticipate this quite so far in advance? Might it not
be seen as folly to&mdash; ?'</p>

<p>'Because to wait would be the greater folly,' the King said
patiently. 'If one plans an attack at dawn one does not wait until
dawn itself before rousing one's troops. One starts to get them
organised in the middle of the night.'</p>

<p>'Duke Walen, you feel as I do, don't you?' Ulresile said,
sounding exasperated.</p>

<p>'I feel there is no point disputing with a King, even when he
makes what seems like an error to us lesser mortals,' the new Duke
Walen said.</p>

<p>The new Duke was, by all accounts, a worthy successor to his
late brother, who had died without issue and so ensured that his
title went to a sibling the strength of whose resentment at being
born, by his reckoning, a year too late had only ever been matched
by his estimation of his own worth. He seemed to be a sullen sort
of fellow, and gave the impression of being, if anything, rather
older than the old Duke.</p>

<p>'What about you, Ormin?' the King asked. 'Do you think I
anticipate matters too much?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps a little, sir,' Ormin said with a pained expression.
'But it is difficult to gauge these matters with any accuracy. I
suspect one only finds out if one has done the right thing after
some considerable time has passed. Sometimes it is only one's
children who discover what the rights and wrongs of it all were.
Bit like planting trees, really.' He uttered this last sentence
with a look of mild surprise at his own words.</p>

<p>Ulresile frowned at him. 'Trees grow, Duke. We are having the
forest cut down around us.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but with the wood you can build houses, bridges, ships,'
the King said, smiling. 'And trees do grow back again. Unlike
heads, say.'</p>

<p>Ulresile's lips went tight.</p>

<p>'I think that perhaps what the Duke means,' Ormin said, 'is that
we may be proceeding a little too quickly with these . . .
alterations. We run the risk of removing or at least curtailing too
much of the power of the existing noble structure before there is
another framework properly in place to carry the load. I confess
that I for one am worried that the burghers in some of the towns in
my own province have not entirely grasped the idea of taking
responsibility for the transfer of land ownership, for
example.'</p>

<p>'And yet they must have been trading grains and animals, or the
produce of their own trade or craft for generations,' the King
said, holding up his left hand, which the Doctor had just completed
bandaging. He inspected it closely, as though looking for a flaw.
'It would seem strange that just because their seigneur has decided
who farmed what or who lived where in the past they cannot grasp
the idea of being able to make their own decisions in the matter.
Indeed you might even find that they have been doing so already,
but in what you might call an informal way, without your
knowledge.'</p>

<p>'No, they are simple people, sir,' Ulresile said. 'One day they
may be ready for such responsibility, but not yet.'</p>

<p>'Do you know,' the King said earnestly, 'I don't think I was
ready for the responsibility that I had to shoulder when my father
died?'</p>

<p>'Oh, now, sir,' Ormin said. 'You are too modest. Of course you
were ready, and have been entirely proved to be so by all manner of
subsequent events. Indeed you proved so with great expedition.'</p>

<p>'No, I don't think I was,' the King said. 'Certainly I didn't
feel I was, and I'd bet that if you had taken a poll of all the
dukes and other nobles in the court at the time and they had been
allowed to say what they really thought, not what I or my father
wished to hear &mdash; they would have said to a man that I wasn't ready
for that responsibility. What's more, I would have agreed with
them. Yet my father died, I was forced to the throne, and although
I knew I was not ready, I coped. I learned. I became a King by
having to behave as one, not simply because I was my father's son
and had been told long in advance that I would become so.'</p>

<p>Ormin nodded at this.</p>

<p>'I'm sure we take your majesty's point,' Ulresile said as
Wiester and a couple of servants helped the King on with heavy
ceremonial robes. The Doctor stood back to let them slide the
King's arms through the sleeves before completing the tying of the
bandages on his right hand.</p>

<p>'I think we must be brave, my friends,' Duke Ormin said to Walen
and Ulresile. 'The King is right. We live in a new age and we must
have the courage to behave in new ways. The laws of Providence may
be eternal, but their application in the world must change as the
times do. The King is right to commend the common sense of the
farmers and the craftsmen. They have great practical experience in
many things. We ought not to under-estimate their abilities simply
because they are not high-born.'</p>

<p>'Quite,' the King said, drawing himself up and putting his head
back to have his hair combed before it was gathered into a
knot.</p>

<p>Ulresile looked at Ormin as though he was going to spit.
'Practical experience is all very well when a man makes tables or
has to control a haul pulling a plough,' he said. 'But we are
concerning ourselves with the governance of our provinces, and in
that it is ourselves who have the whole part of the
experience.'</p>

<p>The Doctor admired her handiwork on the King's bandaged hands,
then stood back. The breeze brought a distinct smell of flowers and
grain-dust billowing in across the bowed fabric walls of our
temporary courtyard.</p>

<p>The King let Wiester slide his thick stave-gloves on to his
hands and then lace them up. Another servant placed stout-looking
but richly decorated boots in front of the King and carefully
guided his feet into them. 'Then, my dear Ulresile,' he said, 'you
must teach the burghers of the towns what you know, or they will
make mistakes and we shall all be the poorer, for I hope we can all
expect a better crop of taxes from such improvements.' The King
sniffed a couple of times.</p>

<p>'I'm sure the ducal estates' share of any increase will not be
unappreciated, should it materialise,' Duke Ormin said, with the
look of one experiencing an attack of wind. 'As indeed I am sure it
will. Yes, I am.'</p>

<p>The King looked at him quickly, with the heavy-lidded gaze of
one about to sneeze. 'Then you would be prepared to put the reforms
into effect first in your province, Ormin?</p>

<p>Ormin blinked, then smiled. He bowed. 'It would be an honour,
sir.'</p>

<p>The King took a deep breath, then shook his head and clapped his
hands together as best he could. He cast a victorious look at
Ulresile, who was staring at Ormin with a look of horror and
disgust.</p>

<p>The Doctor knelt at her bag. I thought she was going to
help me put the various bits and pieces away, but instead she took
out a clean square of cloth and rose to stand before the King just
as he sneezed mightily, jerking his hair out of the grip of the
flunky combing it and sending the comb catapulting forward on to a
brightly coloured rug.</p>

<p>'Sir, if I may,' the Doctor said. The King nodded. Wiester
looked discomfited. He was only now getting out his kerchief.</p>

<p>The Doctor gently held the cloth up to the King's nose, letting
him sniff into it. She folded the cloth and then with another
corner dabbed softly at his eyes, which had moistened. 'Thank you,
Doctor,' he said. 'And what do you think of our reforms?'</p>

<p>'I, sir?' the Doctor said, looking surprised. 'It is no business
of mine.'</p>

<p>'Now, Vosill,' the King said. 'You have an opinion about
everything else. I assumed you would be more in favour than anybody
here. Come, you must be happy with this. It's something like what
you have in your precious Drezen, isn't it? You've talked about
such things at inordinate length before now.' He frowned. Duke
Ulresile did not look happy. I saw him glance at Walen, who too
appeared troubled. Duke Ormin appeared not to be listening, though
his face bore a surprised expression.</p>

<p>The Doctor folded the cloth away slowly. 'I have talked about
many things to contrast the place I chose to leave with the place I
chose to come to,' she said, with a deliberateness equal to that
she gave the folding away of that cloth.</p>

<p>'I'm sure nothing we could do would be good enough for the
lady's high standards,' Duke Ulresile said, with what sounded like
bitterness, perhaps even contempt. 'She has made that clear
enough.'</p>

<p>The Doctor gave a brief, small smile like a wince, and said to
the King, 'Sir, may I be excused now?'</p>

<p>'Of course, Vosill,' the King said, with a look of surprise and
concern. She turned to leave, and he held up his gloved hands as a
servant brought forward the silver and gold inlaid staff he would
fight the false monster with. In the distance, horns sounded and a
cheer went up. 'Thank you,' he said to her. She turned back briefly
to him, bowed quickly and then walked away. I followed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My Master knows already what took place when the surprise that
the old Duke Walen had spent most of a year preparing was finally
visited upon the Doctor, but I shall say something of the event, in
the hope of completing the picture he will already have.</p>

<p>The court had been back at Haspide for only two days. I had not
yet finished unpacking all the Doctor's belongings. There was to be
a diplomatic reception in the main hall, and the Doctor's presence
had been requested. Neither she nor I knew who had made this
request. She went out early that morning, saying that she was going
to visit one of the hospitals she had paid regular visits to before
we had left on the outer part of the Circuition earlier that year.
I was instructed to stay behind and continue with the process of
getting her apartments in order again. I understand that my Master
had one of his people follow the Doctor, and discovered that she
did indeed go to the Women's Hospital and attend some of the sick
and confined there. I spent the time removing racks of glassware
and vials from straw-packed cases and making a list of the fresh
ingredients we would need over the next half-year for the Doctor's
potions and remedies.</p>

<p>She returned to her apartments at about a half past the
morning's third bell, bathed and changed into more formal wear, and
then took me with her to the great hall.</p>

<p>I cannot recall there being any great air of expectation in the
place, but then it was a crowded scene, with hundreds of courtiers,
foreign diplomats, consular people, nobles and traders and others
milling about, all no doubt concerned with their own business and
quite convinced that it was more important than anybody else's and
merited, if it would help them, the particular attention of the
King. Certainly the Doctor seemed to have no premonition that
anything strange or untoward was about to happen. If she seemed
distracted it was because she wanted to get on with the matter of
getting her apartments, her study and workshop and her chemical
machinery back together. As we made our way to the hall, she had me
note down several ingredients and raw materials she suddenly
realised she would be needing in the near future.</p>


<p>'Ah, my dear Doctor,' Duke Ormin said, pressing his way through
an exotically garbed knot of incomprehensibly jabbering foreigners.
'I'm told there's somebody here to see you, ma'am.'</p>


<p>'Is there?' the Doctor asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Ormin said. He stood straight for a change, and looked
out over the heads of the crowd. 'Our new Duke Walen and, ah, Guard
Commander Adlain said something.' He squinted into the distance.
'Didn't catch it all and they seemed . . . Ah, there they are. Over
there.' The Duke waved, then looked at the Doctor. 'Were you
expecting anybody?'</p>

<p>'Expecting anybody?' the Doctor repeated as the Duke led us to
one corner of the hall.</p>

<p>'Yes. I just . . . well, I don't know. . .'</p>

<p>We approached the Guard Commander. I missed whatever the Doctor
and Duke Ormin said next because I was watching the Guard Commander
talk to a couple of his guard captains, two intimidatingly large,
stern-faced men armed with double swords. As he saw us approach,
the Guard Commander nodded to the two men. They stepped away to
stand a few paces off.</p>

<p>'Doctor,' Guard Commander Adlain said in an open, friendly
manner, putting his arm to one side of the Doctor as though to
grasp her far shoulder, so that she had to turn to one side. 'Good
day. How are you? Unpacked? Are you happily reensconced?'</p>

<p>'I am well, sir. We are not yet quite fully settled in. And
you?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm . . .' The Guard Commander looked behind him, then a
look of some surprise came upon his face. 'Ah. Here's Ulresile. And
who can this be?'</p>

<p>He and the Doctor both turned round to face Duke Ulresile and a
tall, bronzed-looking man of middle age dressed in strange,
loose-fitting clothes and a small tricorn hat. Duke Ulresile was
smiling with a curious eagerness. Behind him stood the new Duke
Walen, his head down and his dark eyes looking half closed.</p>

<p>The bronzed stranger had rather a prominent nose, and perched
upon it was an odd framework of metal with two coin-sized pieces of
glass set in it, one in front of each eye. He took this off with
one hand as though it was a hat (that was left on) and made a deep
bow. I half expected his hat to fall off, but it appeared to be
held in place by three jewel-headed pins.</p>

<p>When he straightened, the fellow spoke at the Doctor in a
language quite unlike anything I had ever heard before, full of
strange gutturals and odd tonal shifts.</p>

<p>She looked at him blankly. His friendly expression seemed to
waver. Duke Walen's eyes narrowed. Ulresile's smile broadened and
he took in a breath.</p>

<p>Then the Doctor grinned, and reached out and took the stranger's
hands in hers. She laughed and shook her head and out of her mouth
rattled a stream of sound that sounded very like the sort of sound
the stranger had produced. In amongst all this expeditious
blabbering I caught the words 'Drezen' (though it sounded more like
'Drech-tsen'), 'Pressel', 'Vosill' and, several times, something
that sounded like Koo-doon. The pair of them stood beaming huge
smiles at each other and talking in a continuous stream of sound,
all the time laughing and nodding and shaking their heads. I
watched the smile on Duke Ulresile's face fade slowly, withering
like a cut flower. The sullen, hooded expression on the new Duke
Walen's face did not alter. The Guard Commander Adlain looked on
with a fascinated expression, his gaze flitting to Ulresile now and
again, a tiny smile playing around his lips.</p>

<p>'Oelph,' I heard the Doctor say, and she turned to me. 'Oelph,'
she said again, holding one hand out to me. She was still grinning
broadly. 'This is gaan Kuduhn, from Drezen! Gaan Kuduhn,' she said
to the foreigner. 'Blabber blabber Oelph,' (well it sounded so to
me) she said to him. I recalled that the Doctor had told me that a
gaan was some sort of part-time diplomatic rank.</p>

<p>The tall, bronzed man took the wire contraption off his nose
again and bowed to me. 'I ham press to meet yore, Welph,' he said
slowly in something resembling Haspidian.</p>

<p>'How do you do, Mr Kuduhn,' I said, also bowing.</p>

<p>She introduced Duke Ormin too. The gaan had already met Walen,
Ulresile and the Guard Commander.</p>

<p>'The gaan is from an island in the same group as my own,' the
Doctor said. She looked quite flushed and excited. 'He was invited
here from Cuskery by the old Duke Walen to discuss trade. He took a
quite different route to mine but it seems to have taken him just
as long. He has been away from Drezen almost as long as I have so
he has little fresh news, but it is just so good to hear Drezeni
spoken again!' She turned her smile to him again as she said, 'I
think I shall see if I can persuade him to stay and found a proper
embassy.' She started blabbering to him again.</p>

<p>Ulresile and Walen looked at each other. Guard Commander Adlain
looked up at the ceiling of the great hall for a moment, then he
made a small tutting noise. 'Well, gentlemen,' he said to the three
Dukes. 'I think we are somewhat surplus to requirements here, don't
you?'</p>

<p>Duke Ormin gave a distracted, 'Hmm.' The other two men glared on
at the Doctor and the gaan Kuduhn with what looked like
disappointment, though in the new Duke Walen's case this required
no alteration to his normal expression.</p>

<p>'Fascinating though I'm sure this exchange is in its native
language, I have other business to attend to,' Adlain said. 'If
you'll excuse me. . .' He nodded to the Dukes and walked off,
nodding to the two bulky guard captains, who followed in his
wake.</p>

<p>'Duke Walen, Duke Ulresile,' the Doctor said, still smiling.
'Thank you so much. I am most flattered you thought to introduce me
to the gaan with such dispatch.'</p>

<p>The new Duke Walen remained silent. Ulresile seemed to swallow
something bitter. 'Our pleasure, madam.'</p>

<p>'Is the gaan required for an audience with the King?' she
asked.</p>

<p>'No, he is not required for an audience with the King,' Ulresile
said.</p>

<p>''Then may I take him from you for a while? I'd so much like to
talk with him.'</p>

<p>Ulresile tipped his head and gave a small twist of a smile.
'Please. Be our guest.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Master, I spent a bell and a half with the Doctor and her
newfound friend in an alcove off the Song Court Gallery and learned
nothing except that Drezeni talk like the world is due to end at any
moment and sometimes take their wine with water and a little sugar.
The gaan Kuduhn did have an audience with the King later that day,
and asked the Doctor to interpret for him, as his Imperial was
little better than his Haspidian. She agreed happily.</p>

<p>That afternoon, I was sent by myself to the apothecary Shavine
to buy chemicals and other supplies for the Doctor's workshop. The
Doctor looked quite radiant when I left, dressing and preparing
with great care for her meeting with the gaan Kuduhn and the King.
When I inquired, I was told that I would not be needed again until
the evening.</p>

<p>It was a fine, warm day. I took the long way to the
apothecary's, walking down by the docks and recalling the stormy
night half a year earlier when I had come here in search of the
children who had been sent for ice. I recalled the child in the
cramped, filthy room in the tenement in the poor quarter and the
terrible fever that had killed her despite all the Doctor could
do.</p>

<p>The docks smelled of fish and tar and the sea.</p>

<p>Clutching a hamper of glazed clay jars and glass tubes all
wrapped in straw, I stopped off at a tavern. I tried some wine with
water and sugar, but it was not to my taste. For some time I just
sat and stared at the street through the open window. I returned to
the palace around the fourth bell of the evening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The door to the Doctor's apartments hung open. This was not like
her. I hesitated to proceed further, suddenly filled with a sense
of dread. I entered and found a pair of short dress boots and a
small formal waist-cape lying on the floor of the sitting room. I
put my hamper of chemicals and ingredients down on the table and
went through to the workshop, where I could hear a voice.</p>

<p>The Doctor sat with her feet up on the workshop bench, her naked
heels resting on a sheaf of papers, her legs exposed to the knee
and the neck of her gown unbuttoned over her chest. Her long
copper-red hair hung down loose behind her. One of the room's
roof-hung censers swung in slow loops above her head, leaving a
smoky, herb-scented trail. Her battered old knife lay on the bench
by her elbow. She held a goblet. Her face looked red about the
eyes. I got the impression she had been talking to herself. She
turned to me and fixed me with a watery look.</p>

<p>'Ah, Oelph,' she said.</p>

<p>'Mistress? Are you all right?'</p>

<p>'Oh, not really, Oelph.' She picked up a jug. 'Want a
drink?'</p>

<p>I looked around. 'Shall I just close the apartment door?'</p>

<p>She appeared to consider this. 'Yes,' she said. 'Closing doors
seems to be the order of the day. Why not? Then come back and have
a drink. It's sad to drink alone.'</p>

<p>I went and closed the door, found a goblet and brought another
chair into the workshop to sit with her. She poured some liquor
into my goblet.</p>

<p>I looked into the vessel. The liquid did not smell. 'What is
this, mistress?'</p>

<p>'Alcohol,' she said. 'Very pure.' She sniffed at it. 'Though it
still has an intriguing bouquet.'</p>

<p>'Mistress, is this the distillation you have the royal
apothecary make for us?'</p>

<p>'The same,' she said, drinking from her goblet.</p>

<p>I sipped at it, then coughed and tried not to splutter it back
out again. 'It's strong, isn't it?' I said hoarsely.</p>

<p>'It needs to be,' the Doctor said in a morose tone.</p>

<p>'What is wrong, mistress?'</p>

<p>She looked at me. After a moment or two she said, 'I am a very
foolish woman, Oelph.'</p>

<p>'Mistress, you are the cleverest and most wise woman I have ever
met, indeed you are one of the cleverest and most wise people I
have ever met.'</p>

<p>'You are too kind, Oelph,' she said, staring into her goblet.
'But I am still foolish. Nobody is smart in every way. It's as
though we all have to have something we're stupid about. I have
just been very stupid with the King.'</p>

<p>'With the King, mistress?' I asked, worried.</p>

<p>'Yes, Oelph. With the King.'</p>

<p>'Mistress, I am sure the King is most considerate and
understanding and will not hold whatever you have done against you.
Indeed perhaps the offence, if offence there was, seems greater to
you than it does to him.'</p>

<p>'Oh, it wasn't much of an offence, Oelph, it was just . . .
stupidity.'</p>

<p>'I find that hard to believe, mistress.'</p>

<p>'Me too. I find it hard to believe. But I did it.'</p>

<p>I took the merest sip from my goblet. 'Can you tell me what
happened, mistress?'</p>

<p>She looked unsteadily at me again. 'Will you keep what I tell
you. . .'she began, and I confess that my heart seemed to sink into
my boots at these words. But I was saved from a further extension
of my perjury and betrayal, or from a wantonly rash admission of my
own, by her next words. 'Oh, no,' she said, shaking her head and
rubbing her face with her free hand. 'No, it doesn't matter. People
will hear if the King wants them to. It doesn't matter anyway. Who
cares?'</p>

<p>I said nothing. She bit her lower lip, then took another drink.
She smiled sadly at me as she said, 'I told the King how I feel
about him, Oelph,' she said, and sighed. She gave a shrug as though
to say, Well, there you are.</p>

<p>I looked down at the floor. 'And how is that, mistress?' I asked
quietly.</p>

<p>'I think you might be able to guess, Oelph,' she said.</p>

<p>I found that I too was biting my lip now. I took a drink, for
something to do. 'I'm sure we both love the King, mistress.'</p>

<p>'Everybody loves the King,' she said bitterly. 'Or says that
they do. It is what one is supposed to feel, what one is obliged to
feel. I felt something else. Something it was very stupid and
unprofessional of me to admit to, but I did. After the audience
with gaan Kuduhn &mdash; you know I do believe that old bastard Walen
thought he was setting me up?' she said, as though interrupting
herself. I choked on my drink. I was unused to hearing the Doctor
swear. It distressed me. 'Yes,' she said. 'I think he thought that
I wasn't . . . that I was . . . well, anyway, it was after the
audience with the gaan. We were alone. Just him and me. A stiff
neck. I don't know,' she said miserably. 'Maybe I was excited at
having met somebody from home.'</p>

<p>Suddenly she sobbed, and I looked up to see her bending forward
so that her head was lowered towards her knees. She put the goblet
down with a thud on the workbench and held her head in her hands.
'Oh, Oelph,' she whispered. 'I have done such terrible things.'</p>

<p>I stared at her, wondering what in Providence she could be
talking about. She sniffed, wiped her eyes and nose with her
sleeve, then put her hand out to the goblet again. It hesitated by
the old dagger lying nearby, then grasped the goblet and brought it
towards her lips. 'I can't believe I did that, Oelph. I can't
believe that I told him. And do you know what he told me?' she
asked, with a hopeless, wavering smile. I shook my head.</p>

<p>'He told me that of course he knew. Did I think he was stupid?
And oh, he was flattered, but it would be even more unwise for him
to respond to me than it had been for me to make the declaration in
the first place. Besides, he only liked, he only felt comfortable
with pretty, dainty, delicate women who had no brains. That was
what he liked. Not wit, not intelligence, certainly not learning.'
She snorted. 'Vacuity. That's what he wants. A pretty face fronting
an empty head! Ha!' She threw back the last of her drink, then
refilled the goblet, spilling some of the liquor on her gown and
the floor.</p>

<p>'You fucking cretin, Vosill,' she muttered to herself.</p>

<p>My blood ran cold at her words. I wanted to hug her, to hold
her, to take her in my arms . . . and at the same time I wanted to
be anywhere else but there, then.</p>

<p>'He wants stupidity, well . . . Oh, do you see the irony of it,
Oelph?' she said. 'The only moronic thing I've done since I landed
was to tell him I loved him. It was utterly, completely,
definitively and absolutely imbecilic, and yet it still isn't
enough. He wants consistent dim-wittedness.' She stared into her
goblet. 'Can't say I blame him.' She drank. She coughed, and had to
put the goblet down on the bench. The goblet's base settled on her
old dagger, so that the vessel over-balanced and fell with a crash
to the floor, breaking and splashing the alcohol across the boards.
She brought her feet down from the bench and put them under the
chair she sat on, her head in her hands again as she curled up and
started to weep.</p>

<p>'Oh, Oelph,' she cried. 'What have I done?' She rocked to and
fro on the seat, her face buried in her hands, her long fingers
like a cage around her tangle of red hair. 'What have I done? What
have I done?'</p>

<p>I felt terrified. I did not know what to do. I had been feeling
so mature, so grown up, so capable and in control over these last
couple of seasons, but now I felt like a child again, quite
perfectly unsure what to do when confronted with the pain and
distress of an adult.</p>

<p>I hesitated, a terrible feeling growing in me that whatever I
did next it would be the wrong thing, the wrong thing entirely, and
I would suffer for it for ever more and worse still so might she,
but eventually, while she rocked back and forth and moaned
piteously to herself, I put my goblet down at my feet and got out
of my seat and went to squat by her. I reached out one hand and
placed it gently on her shoulder. She did not react. I let my hand
go back and forth with her rocking, then slid my arm further round
her shoulders. Somehow, touching her like that, she suddenly seemed
smaller than I had always thought her.</p>

<p>Still she did not seem to think I had committed any terrible
transgression by touching her so, and, finding my courage and
taking it by the scruff of its neck, I moved closer to her and put
both my arms around her, holding her, slowly stopping her rocking,
feeling the warmth of her body and tasting the sweet air of her
breath. She let me hold her.</p>

<p>I was doing what I had imagined doing only moments earlier,
doing something I had imagined doing for the last year, something I
thought would. never, could never happen, something I had dreamed
about night after night after night for season upon season, and
something that I had hoped, and still hoped somehow might lead to
an even more intimate embrace, no matter that that had seemed
almost absurdly unlikely, and indeed still did.</p>

<p>I felt her grip on her head loosen. She brought her arms out and
put them round me. Embraced by her. My head seemed to swim. Her
face, hot and wet from her tears, was next to mine now. I shook
with terror, wondering if I dare turn my face towards hers, bring
my mouth close to her lips.</p>

<p>'Oh, Oelph,' she said into my shoulder. 'It is not fair to use
you so.'</p>

<p>'You may use me as you wish, mistress,' I said, gulping on the
words. I could smell some delicate perfume rising from her warm
body, its tender scent not swamped by the fumes of the alcohol, and
infinitely more heady. 'Is it. . . ?' I began, then had to stop to
swallow on a dry mouth. 'Is it so terrible to take the risk of
telling somebody the feelings you have for them, even if you
suspect they feel nothing similar for you? Is it wrong,
mistress?'</p>

<p>She pushed herself gently away from me. Her face, tearstreaked,
puffy-eyed and red, was still calmly beautiful. Her eyes seemed to
search mine. 'It is never wrong, Oelph,' she said softly. She
reached down and took both my hands in hers. 'But I am no more
blind than the King. Nor any more able to offer requital.'</p>

<p>I wondered stupidly what she meant for a moment before
realising, and feeling a terrible sadness fall slowly on my soul,
as though a great shroud had been dropped inside me, settling with
a sorrowful, implacable inevitability over all my hopes and dreams,
obliterating them for ever.</p>

<p>She put one hand to my cheek, and her fingers were still warm
and dry and tender and firm at once, and her skin, I swear, smelled
sweet. 'You are very precious to me, dear Oelph.'</p>

<p>I heard those words and my heart sank farther, and steeper.</p>

<p>'Am I, mistress?'</p>

<p>'Of course.' She drew away from me and looked down at the
smashed goblet. 'Of course you are.' She settled back in her seat
and took a deep breath, pushing a hand through her hair, smoothing
down her gown and attempting to button its yoke. Her fingers would
not do as she willed. I longed, from far away, to help her, or
rather not to help her with that task, but eventually she gave up
anyway, and just pulled the long collar to. She looked up into my
face, drying her cheeks with her fingers. 'I think I need to sleep,
Oelph. Will you excuse me, please?'</p>

<p>I lifted my goblet from the floor and put it on the workbench.
'Of course, mistress. Is there anything I can do?'</p>

<p>'No.' She shook her head. 'No, there is nothing you can do.' She
looked away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="chapter">20. THE BODYGUARD</h3>

<p>'I told the boy a story of my own.'</p>

<p>'You did?'</p>

<p>'Yes. It was a pack of lies.'</p>

<p>'Well, all stories are lies, in a way.'</p>

<p>'This was worse. This was a true story turned into a lie.'</p>

<p>'You must have felt there was a reason to do that.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I did.'</p>

<p>'What was the reason you felt that way?'</p>

<p>'Because I wanted to tell the story, but I could not tell it
truly to a child. It is the only story I know worth telling, the
story I think most about, the story that I live again and again in
my dreams, the story that feels as if it needs to be told, and yet
a child could not understand it, or if they could, it would be an
inhuman thing to tell them it.'</p>

<p>'Hmm. It doesn't sound like a story you have ever told me.'</p>

<p>'Shall I tell it to you now?'</p>

<p>'It sounds like a painful story to tell.'</p>

<p>'It is. Perhaps it is painful to hear, too.'</p>

<p>'Do you want to tell it to me?'</p>

<p>'I don't know.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Protector returned to his palace. His son still lived,
though his grip on life seemed tenuous and frail. Doctor BreDelle
took over from Doctor AeSimil but he was no more able to determine
what was wrong with the boy than he was able to treat him
successfully. Lattens drifted in and out of consciousness,
sometimes unable to recognise his father or his nurse, on other
occasions sitting up in bed and pronouncing himself feeling much
better and almost recovered. These periods of lucidity and apparent
recovery grew further and further apart, however, and the boy spent
more and more time curled up in his bed, asleep or in a halfway
stage between sleep and wakefulness, eyes closed, limbs twitching,
muttering to himself, turning and moving and jerking as though in a
fit. He ate almost nothing, and would drink only water or very
diluted fruit juice.</p>

<p>DeWar still worried that Lattens might be being poisoned in some
subtle way. He arranged with the Protector and the superintendent
of an orphans' home that a set of twins be brought to the palace to
act as tasters for the boy. The two identical boys were a year
younger than Lattens.</p>

<p>They were slightly built and a poor start in life had left them
with delicate constitutions which made them prone to any passing
illness. Nevertheless, they thrived while Lattens weakened, happily
finishing off each of the meals he barely tasted, so that by the
proportion consumed it might have seemed to a casual observer that
it was he who tasted the food for them.</p>

<p>For a few days after their even more hurried return to Crough,
UrLeyn and those in his immediate party had out-distanced the news
from Ladenscion, and there was a frustrating lack of new
intelligence from the war. UrLeyn stamped about the palace, unable
to settle to anything, and found little solace even in the harem.
The younger girls in particular only made him annoyed with their
simpering attempts at sympathy, and he spent more time with Perrund
than with all of them, just sitting talking on most occasions.</p>

<p>A hunt was arranged, but the Protector called it off just before
it started, worried that the chase might take him too far away from
the palace and the sick bed of his son. He attempted to apply
himself to the many other affairs of state, but could find little
patience for courtiers, provincial representatives or foreign
dignitaries. He spent longer in the palace library, reading old
accounts of history and the lives of ancient heroes.</p>

<p>When news did eventually arrive from Ladenscion it was
equivocal. Another city had been taken but yet more men and war
machines had been lost. A few of the barons had indicated that they
wanted to discuss terms that would let them remain loyal to
Tassasen in theory and through token tribute, but retain the
independence they had achieved through their rebellion. As generals
Ralboute and Simalg understood that this was not a course the
Protector wished to pursue, more troops were called for. It was to
be hoped that as this news had undoubtedly crossed with the fresh
soldiers already on their way to the war, this last request was
redundant. This intelligence had been delivered in a coded letter
and there seemed little to debate or discuss as a result of it, but
UrLeyn convened a full war cabinet in the map-hall nevertheless.
DeWar was invited to attend but commanded not to speak.</p>

<p>'Perhaps the best thing would be for you to take yourself away,
brother.'</p>

<p>'Take myself away? What? Go on an improving tour? Visit some old
aunt in the countryside? What do you think you mean, "take myself
away"?'</p>

<p>'I mean that perhaps the best thing would be for you to be
somewhere else,' RuLeuin said, frowning.</p>

<p>'The best thing, brother,' UrLeyn said, 'would be for my son to
make a full and swift recovery, the war in Ladenscion to end
immediately in total victory, and my advisors and family to stop
suggesting idiocies.'</p>

<p>DeWar hoped RuLeuin would hear the annoyance in his brother's
voice and take the hint, but he kept on. 'Well then,' he said, 'the
better thing, I should have said, rather than the best, might be to
go to Ladenscion, perhaps. To take on all the responsibilities of
the war's command and so to have less room in your mind for the
worry the boy's illness must be causing you.'</p>

<p>DeWar, sitting just behind UrLeyn at the head of the map table,
could see some of the others looking at RuLeuin with expressions of
disapproval and even mild scorn.</p>

<p>UrLeyn shook his head angrily. 'Great Providence, brother, what
do you think I am? Were either of us raised to be so lacking in
feeling? Can you simply turn off your emotions? I cannot, and I
would treat with the gravest suspicion anybody who claimed they
could. They would not be a man, they would be a machine. An animal.
Providence, even animals have emotions.' UrLeyn glanced round the
others gathered about the table, as though daring any of them to
assert such coldness for themselves. 'I can't leave the boy like
this. I did try to, as you may recall, and I was called back. Would
you have me go and then be worrying about him every day and night?
Would you have me there in Ladenscion while my heart was here,
taking command but unable to give it my full attention?'</p>

<p>RuLeuin finally seemed to see the wisdom in remaining silent. He
pressed his lips together and studied the table top in front of
him.</p>

<p>'We are here to discuss what to do about this damned war,'
UrLeyn said, gesturing at the map of Tassasen's borders spread out
in the centre of the great table. 'The condition of my son keeps me
here in Crough but other than that it has no bearing on our
meeting. I'll thank you not to mention it again.' He glared at
RuLeuin, who still stared tight-upped at the table. 'Now, has
anyone anything to say which might actually prove useful?'</p>

<p>'What is to be said, sir?' ZeSpiole said. 'We are told little in
this latest news. The war continues. The barons wish to keep what
they hold. We are too far from it to be able to contribute much.
Unless it is to agree to what the barons propose.'</p>

<p>'That is scarcely more helpful,' UrLeyn told the Guard Commander
impatiently.</p>

<p>'We can send more troops,' YetAmidous said. 'But I wouldn't
advise it. We have few enough left to defend the capital as it is,
and the other provinces have been stripped bare already.'</p>

<p>'It is true, sir,' said VilTere, a young provincial commander
called to the capital with a company of light cannon. VilTere's
father had been an old comrade of UrLeyn's during the war of
succession and the Protector had invited him to the meeting. 'If we
take too many men to punish the barons we might be seen to
encourage others to emulate them by leaving our provinces devoid of
policing.'</p>

<p>'If we punish the barons severely enough,' UrLeyn said, 'we
might be able to convince these "others" of the folly of such a
course.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, sir,' the provincial commander said. 'But first we must
do so, and then they must hear about it.'</p>

<p>'They'll hear about it,' UrLeyn said darkly. 'I have lost all
patience with this war. I will accept nothing else than complete
victory. No further negotiations will be entered into. I am sending
word to Simalg and Ralboute that they must do all they can to
capture the barons, and when they do they are to send them here
like common thieves, though better guarded. They will be dealt with
most severely.'</p>

<p>BiLeth looked stricken. UrLeyn noticed. 'Yes, BiLeth?' he
snapped.</p>

<p>The foreign minister looked even more discomfited. 'I . . .' he
began. 'I, well . . .'</p>

<p>'What, man?' UrLeyn shouted. The tall foreign minister jumped in
his seat, his long, thin grey hair flouncing briefly.</p>

<p>'Are you . . . is the Protector quite . . . it's just that,
sir...'</p>

<p>'Great Providence, BiLeth!' UrLeyn roared. 'You're not going to
<em>disagree</em> with me, are you? Finally found a sliver of
backbone, have we? Where in the skies of hell did that fall
from?'</p>

<p>BiLeth looked grey. 'I do beg the Protector's pardon. I would
simply beg to ask him reconsider treating the barons in quite such
a fashion,' he said, a desperate, anguished look on his narrow
face.</p>

<p>'How the fuck should I treat the bastards?' UrLeyn asked, his
voice low but seething with derision. 'They make war on us, they
make fools of us, they make widows of our women-folk.' UrLeyn
slammed a fist on to the table, making the map of the borderlands
flap in the breeze. 'How in the name of all the old gods am I
<em>supposed</em> to treat the sons of bitches?'</p>

<p>BiLeth looked as if he was about to cry. Even DeWar felt
slightly sorry for him. 'But sir,' the foreign minister said in a
small voice, 'several of the barons are related to the Haspidian
royal family. There are matters of diplomatic etiquette when
dealing with nobility, even if they are rebellious. If we can but
prise one away from the others and treat with him well, then
perhaps we can bring him to our side. I understand&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You understand very little, it would seem, sir,' UrLeyn told
him in a voice dripping with scorn. BiLeth seemed to shrink in his
seat. 'I'll have no more talk of etiquette,' he said, spitting out
the word. 'It has become clear that these scum have been teasing
us,' UrLeyn told BiLeth and the others. 'They play the seductress,
these proud barons. They act the coquette. They hint that they
might succumb to us if we treat them just a little better, that
they will be ours if only we flatter them a little more, if only we
can find it in our hearts and our pockets to provide them with a
few more gifts, a few more tokens of our esteem, why then
they will open their gates, then they will help us with
their less cooperative friends and all their resistance so
far will prove to have been for show, a pretty fight they have been
putting up for the sake of their maidenly honour.' UrLeyn hit the
table again. 'Well, <em>no!</em> We have been led along for the last time.
The next leading will be done by an executioner, when he pulls on
the chain of one of these proud barons and brings him to the public
square to be tormented like a common murderer and then put up to
burn. We'll see how the rest of them respond to that!'</p>

<p>YetAmidous slapped the table with the flat of his hand and stood
up out of his seat. 'Well said, sir! That's the spirit!'</p>

<p>ZeSpiole watched BiLeth shrink further in his seat, and
exchanged looks with RuLeuin, who looked down. ZeSpiole pursed his
lips and studied the map on the table. The others gathered round
the table &mdash; lesser generals, advisors and aides &mdash; busied themselves
in a variety of other ways, but none looked directly at the
Protector or said anything in contradiction.</p>

<p>UrLeyn gazed round at their faces with a look of mocking
admonition. 'What, is there nobody else to take my foreign
minister's side?' he asked, waving one hand at the subsiding form
that was BiLeth. 'Is he to remain alone and unseconded in his
campaign?'</p>

<p>Nobody said anything. 'ZeSpiole?' UrLeyn said.</p>

<p>The Guard Commander looked up. 'Sir?'</p>

<p>'Do you think I am right? Should I refuse to entertain any
further advances from our rebellious barons?'</p>

<p>ZeSpiole took a deep breath. 'I think we might profitably
threaten the barons with what you have mentioned, sir.'</p>

<p>'And, if we take one, carry it out, yes?'</p>

<p>ZeSpiole studied the great fan of window on the wall opposite,
where glass and semi-precious stones shone with sunlight. 'I can
appreciate the prospect of seeing one of the barons so humbled,
sir. And as you say, there are enough widows in this city who would
cheer his screams sufficient to drown them out.'</p>

<p>'You see no intemperateness in such a course, sir?' UrLeyn asked
reasonably. 'No rashness, no cruel impetuousness which might
rebound on us?'</p>

<p>'That would be a possibility, perhaps,' ZeSpiole said, with a
flicker of uncertainty.</p>

<p>'A "possibility", "perhaps"?' UrLeyn said in a voice that mocked
the Guard Commander's. 'But we must do better than that, Commander!
This is an important matter. One that needs our gravest
consideration. We cannot make light of it, can we? Or perhaps not.
Perhaps you disagree. Do you disagree, Commander?'</p>

<p>'I agree that we must think hard about what we are going to do,
sir,' ZeSpiole said, his voice and manner serious.</p>

<p>'Good, Commander,' UrLeyn said with what appeared to be
sincerity. 'I am glad we have extracted a hint of decision from
you.' He looked round everybody else. 'Are there any other views I
should hear from any of you?' Heads went down all around the
table.</p>

<p>DeWar began to be thankful that the Protector had not thought to
turn round and ask him his opinion. Indeed he still worried that he
might. He suspected nothing he could say would make the General
happy.</p>

<p>'Sir?' said VilTere. All eyes turned to the young provincial
commander. DeWar hoped he wasn't going to say something stupid.</p>

<p>UrLeyn glared. 'What, sir?'</p>

<p>'Sir, I was, sadly, too young to be a soldier during the war of
succession, but I have heard from many a commander whose opinion I
respect and who served under you that your judgment has always
proved sure and your decisions far-sighted. They told me that even
when they doubted your decree, they trusted you, and that trust was
vindicated. They would not be where they are, and we would not be
here today' &mdash; at this the young commander looked round the others &mdash;
'were it otherwise.'</p>

<p>The other faces round the table searched UrLeyn's for a response
before they reacted.</p>

<p>UrLeyn nodded slowly. 'Perhaps I should take it ill,' he said,
'that it is our most junior and most recently arrived recruit who
holds the highest opinion of my faculties.'</p>

<p>DeWar thought he detected a sense of cautious relief around the
table.</p>

<p>'I'm sure we all feel the same way, sir,' said ZeSpiole with an
indulgent smile to VilTere and a cautious one to UrLeyn.</p>

<p>'Very well,' UrLeyn said. 'We shall consider what fresh troops
we might be able to send to Ladenscion and we shall tell Ralboute
and Simalg to prosecute the war against the barons without respite
or negotiation. Gentlemen.' With that, and a perfunctory nod,
UrLeyn rose and marched away. DeWar followed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Then let me tell you something closer to the truth.'</p>

<p>'Only closer?'</p>

<p>'Sometimes the truth is too much to bear.'</p>

<p>'I have a strong constitution.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but I meant that sometimes it is too much for the teller,
not the told.'</p>

<p>'Ah. Well then, tell me what you can.'</p>

<p>'Oh, there is not so much, now I approach it. And it is a common
story. All too common. The less I tell you of it the more you could
be hearing it from a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand mouths or
more.'</p>

<p>'I have a feeling it is not a happy story.'</p>

<p>'Indeed. Anything but. It is just that of women, especially
young women, caught up in a war.'</p>

<p>'Ah.'</p>

<p>'You see? A story that scarcely needs to be told. The
ingredients imply the finished article, and the method of its
making, do they not? It is men who fight wars, wars are fought
taking villages, towns and cities, where women tend the hearths,
and when the place that they live is taken, so are they. Their
honour becomes one of the spoils, their bodies too invaded. That
territory taken. So my story is no different from that of tens of
thousands of women, regardless of their nation or their tribe. And
yet for me it is everything. For me it is the most important thing
that ever happened to me. For me it was the end of my life, and
what you see before you is like a ghost, a spirit, a mere shade,
unsubstantial.'</p>

<p>'Please, Perrund.' He reached out his hands towards her in a
gesture that required no response and did not seek to end in a
touch. It was instead a movement of sympathy, even supplication.
'If this hurts you so, you don't need to continue for me.'</p>

<p>'Ah, but does it hurt you, DeWar?' she asked, and there was a
sharp edge of bitterness and accusation in her voice. 'Does it make
you embarrassed? I know you have a regard for me, DeWar. We are
friends.' These two sentences were uttered too quickly for him to
be able to react. 'Are you upset on my behalf, or your own? Most
men would rather not hear what their fellows have done, what people
who may indeed be very like them are capable of. Do you prefer not
to think about such things, DeWar? Do you think that you are so
different? Or do you become secretly excited at the idea?'</p>

<p>'Lady, I gain no benefit or pleasure at all from the
subject.'</p>

<p>'Are you sure, DeWar? And if you are, do you really think you
speak for the majority of your sex? For are women not supposed to
resist even those they would happily surrender to, so that when
they resist a more brutal violation how can the man be sure that
any struggle, any protestation is not merely for show?'</p>

<p>'You must believe that we are not all the same. And even if all
men might be said to have . . . base urges, we do not all give in
to them, or pay them any respect, even in secret. I cannot tell you
how sorry I am to hear what happened to you. . .'</p>

<p>'But you have not heard, DeWar. You have not heard at all. I
have implied that I was raped. That did not kill me. That alone
might have killed the girl I was and replaced her with a woman,
with a bitter one, with an angry one, or one who wished to take her
own life, or attempt to take the life of those who violated her, or
one who simply became mad.</p>

<p>'I think I might have become angry and bitter and I would have
hated all men, but I think I would have survived and might have
been persuaded, by the good men I knew in my own family and in my
own town, and perhaps by one good man in particular who must now
for ever remain in my dreams, that all was not lost and the world
was not quite so terrible a place.</p>

<p>'But I never had that opportunity to recover, DeWar. I was
pushed so far down in my despair I could not even tell in which
direction the way back up lay. What happened to me was the least of
it, DeWar. I watched my father and my brothers butchered, after
they had been forced to watch my mother and my sisters being fucked
time after time by a fine and numerous company of high-ranking men.
Oh! You look down! Does my language upset you? Are you offended?
Have I violated your ears with my intemperate, soldiers'
words?'</p>

<p>'Perrund, you must believe that I am sorry for what happened to
you . . .'</p>

<p>'But why should you be sorry? It was not your fault. You were
not there. You assure me that you disapprove, so why should you be
sorry?'</p>

<p>'I would be bitter in your place.'</p>

<p>'In my place? How could that be, DeWar? You are a man. In the
same place you would be, if not one of the violators, one of those
who looked away, or remonstrated with their comrades
afterwards.'</p>

<p>'If I was the age you were then, and a pretty youth&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah, so you can share what happened to me. I see. That is good.
I am comforted.'</p>

<p>'Perrund, say anything you want to me. Blame me if it will help,
but please believe I . . .'</p>

<p>'Believe you what, DeWar? I believe you feel sorry for me, but
your sympathy stings like salty tears in a wound because I am a
proud ghost, you see. Oh yes, a proud ghost. I am an enraged shade,
and a guilty one, because I have come to admit to myself that I
resent what was done to my family because it hurt me, because I was
raised to expect everything to be done for me.</p>

<p>'I loved my parents and my sisters in my own way, but it was not
a selfless love. I loved them because they loved me and made me
feel special. I was their baby, their chosen beloved. Through their
devotion and protection I learned none of the lessons that children
usually learn, about the way the world really works and the way
that children are used within it, until that single day, that one
morning when every fond illusion I held was torn from me and the
brutal truth forced into me.</p>

<p>'I had come to expect the best of everything, I had come to
believe that the world would always treat me as I had been treated
in the past and that those I loved would be there to love me in
return. My fury at what happened to my family is partly caused by
that expectation, that happy assumption, being defiled and
obliterated. That is my guilt.'</p>

<p>'Perrund, you must know that should not be a cause for guilt.
What you feel is what any decent child feels when they realise the
selfishness they have felt when they were younger still. A
selfishness that is only natural to children, especially those who
have been loved so intensely. The realisation occurs, it is felt
briefly and then it is rightly set aside. You have not been able to
set yours aside because of what those men did to you, but&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, stop, stop! Do you think I do not know all this? I know it,
but I am a ghost, DeWar! I know, but I cannot feel, I cannot learn,
I cannot change. I am stuck, I am pinned to that time by that
event. I am condemned.'</p>

<p>'There is nothing I can do or say that can alter what happened
to you, Perrund. I can only listen, only do what you will let me
do.'</p>

<p>'Oh, do I persecute you? Do I make you a victim now, DeWar?'</p>

<p>'No, Perrund.'</p>

<p>'No, Perrund. No, Perrund. Ah, DeWar, the luxury of being able
to say No.'</p>

<p>He went, half kneeling, half on his haunches by her then,
putting himself very near to her but still not touching her, his
knee near hers, his shoulder by her hip, his hands within grasp of
hers. He was close enough to smell her perfume, close enough to
feel the heat from her body, close enough to feel the hot breath
that laboured from her nose and her half-open mouth, close enough
for one hot tear to hit her clenched fist and spatter even tinier
droplets on to his cheek. He kept his head bowed, and crossed his
hands on his raised knee.</p>

<p>The bodyguard DeWar and the court concubine Perrund were in one
of the palace's more secret places. It was an old hiding hole in
one of the lower levels, a space the size of a cupboard which led
off one of the public rooms in the original noble house which had
formed the basis of the greater building.</p>

<p>Retained more for sentimental than practical reasons by the
first monarch of Tassasen and through a kind of indifference by
subsequent rulers, the rooms which had seemed so grand to that
first king had long since been judged too small and mean of
proportion by future generations and were nowadays used only for
storage.</p>

<p>The tiny room had been used to spy on people. It was a listening
post. Unlike the alcove DeWar had burst from to attack the Sea
Company assassin, it was not built for a guard but for a noble, so
that he could sit there, with only a small hole in the stonework
between him and the public room &mdash; that hole perhaps hidden by a
tapestry or painting &mdash; and listen to what his guests were saying
about him.</p>

<p>Perrund and DeWar had come here after she had asked him to show
her some of the parts of the palace he had discovered on the
wanderings which she knew he took. Shown this tiny room, it had
suddenly reminded her of the secret compartment in their house in
which her parents had concealed her when the town was sacked during
the war of succession.</p>

<p>'If I knew who those men were, DeWar, would you be my champion?
Would you avenge my honour?' she asked him.</p>

<p>He looked up into her eyes. They looked extraordinarily bright
in the dim light of the hidden room. 'Yes,' he said. 'If you knew
who they were. If you could be sure. Would you ask me to?'</p>

<p>She shook her head angrily. She wiped away her tears with her
hand. 'No. The ones I could identify are dead now, anyway.'</p>

<p>'Who were they?'</p>

<p>'King's men,' Perrund said, looking up and away from DeWar, as
though telling the small hole where the ancient noble had thought
to eavesdrop on his guests. 'The old King's men. One of his baron
commanders and his friends. They had been in charge of the siege
and the taking of the town. Apparently we were favoured. Whoever
was their spy had told them my father's house held the town's most
comely maidens. They came to us first, and my father tried to offer
them money to leave us alone. They took that badly. A merchant
offering a noble man money!' She looked down at her lap, where her
good hand, still damp with tears, lay beside her wasted hand in its
sling. 'I knew all their names, eventually. All the noble ones, at
any rate. They died during the rest of the course of the war. I
tried to tell myself that I felt good when I heard about the first
few dying, but I did not. I could not. I felt nothing. That was
when I knew I was dead inside. They had planted death in me.'</p>

<p>DeWar waited a long time before he said, softly, 'And yet you
live, and you saved the life of the one who ended the war and
brought about a better law. There is no right of&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah, DeWar, there is always the right of the strong to take the
weak and the rich to take the poor and the powerful to take those
who have no power. UrLeyn may have written down our laws and
changed a few of them, but the laws that still bind us to the
animals cut the deepest. Men compete for power, they strut and
parade and they impress their fellows with their possessions and
they take the women they can. None of that has changed. They may
use weapons other than their hands and teeth, they may use other
men and they may express their dominance in money, not other
symbols of power and glamour, but...'</p>

<p>'And yet,' DeWar insisted, 'still you are alive. And there are
people who have the highest regard for you and feel their lives
have been the better for having known you. Did you not say you had
found a type of peace and contentment here, in the palace?'</p>

<p>'In the harem of the chief,' she said, though with something
more like measured disdain than the fury that had been in her voice
earlier. 'As a cripple kept on out of sympathy in the collection of
mates for the foremost male of the pack.'</p>

<p>'Oh, come. We may act like animals, men especially. But we are
not animals. If we were there would not be the shame in acting so.
We act otherwise, too, and set a better marker. Where is love in
what you say of where you are now? Do you not feel even slightly
loved, Perrund?'</p>

<p>She reached out quickly and put her hand on his cheek, letting
it rest there, as easily and naturally as though they were brother
and sister or a husband and wife, long married.</p>

<p>'As you say, DeWar, our shame comes from the comparison. We know
we might be generous and compassionate and good, and could behave
so, yet something else in our nature makes us otherwise.' She
smiled a small, empty smile. 'Yes, I feel something I recognise as
love. Something I remember,something I may discuss and mull and
theorise over.' She shook her head. 'But it is not something I
know. I am like a blind woman talking about how a tree must look,
or a cloud. Love is something I have a dim memory of, the way
someone who went blind in their early childhood might recall the
sun, or the face of their mother. I know affection from my fellow
whore-wives, DeWar, and I sense regard from you and feel some in
return. I have a duty to the Protector, just as he feels he has a
duty to me. As far as that goes, I am content. But love? That is
for the living, and I am dead.'</p>

<p>She stood, before he could say more. 'Now, please, take me back
to the harem.'</p>

<h3 class="chapter">21. THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p>I do not believe the Doctor thought there was anything amiss. I
know I did not suspect anything. The gaan Kuduhn seemed to have
disappeared as quickly as he had arrived, taking ship for far
Chuenruel the day after we'd met him, which left the Doctor a
little sad. There had, when I thought about it later, been hints
that the palace was preparing for a large contingent of new guests
 &mdash; a degree more activity in certain corridors than one might have
expected, doors being used that were not normally open, rooms being
aired &mdash; but none of it was particularly obvious, and the web of
rumour that connected all the servants, assistants, apprentices and
pages had not yet woken up to what was going on.</p>

<p>It was the second day of the second moon. My mistress was
visiting the old Untouchable Quarter, where once the lowest
classes, foreigners, bondagers and quarantiners were forced to
dwell. It was still a far from salubrious area, but no longer
walled and patrolled. It was there that the Master Chemicalist and
Metaliciser (or so he styled himself) Chelgre had his workshop.</p>

<p>The Doctor had risen very late that morning and seemed much the
worse for wear for about a bell or so. She sighed heavily and
frequently, she said little to me but rather muttered to herself,
she appeared a trifle unsteady on her feet and her face was pale.
However, she shook off the effects of her hangover with astonishing
rapidity, and while she remained subdued for the rest of the
morning and the afternoon, she seemed otherwise back to normal
after her late breakfast, just before we set off for the
Untouchable Quarter.</p>

<p>Of what had been said the night before, not a further word was
spoken. I think both of us were a little embarrassed at what we had
admitted and implied to each other, and so achieved an unspoken but
fully mutual agreement to keep our own counsel on the subject.</p>

<p>Master Chelgre was his usual strange and singular self. He was
of course well known around the Court, both for his wild-haired and
ragged appearance and his abilities with cannons and their dark
powder. I need say no more for the purposes of this report.
Besides, the Doctor and Chelgre talked of nothing that I could
understand.</p>

<p>We returned by the fifth bell of the afternoon, on foot but
escorted by a couple of barrow boys pushing a small cart loaded
with straw-wrapped clays containing yet more chemicals and
ingredients for what I was starting to suspect would be a long
season of experiments and potions.</p>

<p>At the time, I recall feeling mildly resentful of this, for I
did not doubt that I would be heavily involved in whatever the
Doctor had in mind, and that my efforts would be in addition to
those domestic tasks she had come to rely on me performing as a
matter of course. To me, I strongly suspected, would fall most of
the weighing and measuring and grinding and combining and diluting
and washing and scouring and polishing and so on which this new
batch of observations would require. There would be proportionately
less time for me to spend with my fellows, playing cards and
flirting with the kitchen girls, and, without being shy about it,
that sort of thing had become relatively important to me in the
past year.</p>

<p>Even so, I suppose, it could be said that in some cellar of my
soul I was secretly pleased to be so relied upon by the Doctor and
was looking forward to being crucially involved with her efforts.
These would, after all, mean us being together, working as a team,
working as equals, closeted in her study and workshop, passing many
happily intense evenings and nights together, striving for a shared
goal. Could I not hope that a greater regard might blossom in such
intimate circumstances, now that she knew it was in my thoughts?
The Doctor had been decisively rejected by the one she loved, or at
least the one she believed she loved, while the manner in which she
had declined the connotation of my interest in her seemed to me to
be more to do with modesty than hostility or even indifference.</p>

<p>Yet I did feel a degree of petulance towards the ingredients
being wheeled up the street in front of us that evening. How I
regretted that feeling, so soon afterwards. How unsure that future
I had envisaged for myself and her really was.</p>

<p>A warm wind seemed to blow us up the Market Square towards the
Blister Gate, where long shadows advanced to meet us. We entered
the palace. The Doctor paid the barrow boys off and a handful of
servants were summoned to help me carry the clays, crates and boxes
up to our apartments. I laboured under a rotund clay I knew was
full of acid, chafing at the thought of having to share the same
cramped set of rooms with it and its fellows. The Doctor was
talking about having a workbench-level hearth and chimney
constructed to allow the noxious fumes to escape better, but I
suspected that even so the next few moons would see me with
running eyes and an aching nose, not to mention hands pimpled with
tiny burns and clothes perforated with pin-head holes.</p>

<p>We achieved the Doctor's apartments just as Xamis was setting.
The casks, clays and so on were distributed about the rooms, the
servants were thanked and given a few coins, and the Doctor and I
lit the lamps and set to unpacking all the inedible and poisonous
provisions we had purchased from Master Chelgre.</p>

<p>A knock came at the door just after seventh bell. I answered it
to find a servant I did not recognise. He was taller and a little
older than me.</p>

<p>'Oelph?' he said, grinning. 'Here. A note from the GC.' He
shoved a sealed piece of paper addressed to Doctor Vosill into my
hand.</p>

<p>'The who?' I asked, but he had already turned and was sauntering
off down the corridor. I shrugged.</p>

<p>The Doctor read the note. 'I am to attend the Guard Commander
and Duke Ormin in the Suitor's Wing,' she said, sighing and pushing
her fingers through her hair. She looked round the half-unpacked
cases. 'Would you mind doing the rest of this, Oelph?'</p>

<p>'Of course not, mistress.'</p>

<p>'I think it's obvious where everything goes. Like with like. If
there is anything unfamiliar, just leave it on the floor. I'll try
not to be too long.'</p>

<p>'Very well, mistress.'</p>

<p>The Doctor buttoned her shirt up to the neck, sniffed at one of
her armpits (just the sort of thing she did which I found
unladylike and even distressing, but which I look back on now with
an ache of longing), then shrugged, threw on a short jacket, and
made for the door. She opened it, then came back, looked round the
mess of straw, box-planks, twine and sacking that lay strewn across
the floor, picked up her old dagger which she had been using to cut
(or rather saw) the twine around the boxes and crates, and went
off, whistling. The door closed.</p>

<p>I do not know what made me look at the note which had summoned
her. She had left it lying on top of an opened crate, and as I
pulled the straw out of another box nearby, the fold of creamy
paper kept attracting my eye. Eventually, after a glance at the
door, I lifted the note and sat down to read it. It said little
more than what the Doctor had told me. I read it again.</p>

<p>D. Vosill kindly to meet D. Ormin and G.C. Adlain in the
Suitor's Wing on receipt privately. P.G.t.K. Adlain.</p>

<p>Providence Guard the King, indeed. I looked at the last word for
a few moments. The name at the end of the note was Adlain, but it
did not look like his writing, which I knew. Of course the note had
probably been dictated, or composed and written by Epline, Adlain's
page, on his master's instructions. But I thought I knew his
writing, too, and this was not it. I cannot claim that I thought
any further or at any greater depth.</p>

<p>I could claim a host of reasons for what I did next, but the
truth is that I do not know, unless instinct itself can be cited.
Even to call it instinct may be to dignify the urge. At the time it
felt more like a whim, or even a sort of trivial duty. I cannot
even claim that I felt fearful, or had a premonition. I simply did
it.</p>

<p>I had been prepared to follow the Doctor from the start of my
mission. I had expected to be told to shadow her one day, to follow
her into the city on one of the occasions she did not take me along
with her, yet never had my Master requested such a thing. I had
assumed that he retained other people, more experienced and adept
at such behaviour, and less likely to be recognisable to the
Doctor, for such work. So, in putting out the lamps, locking the
door behind me and following her, I was in a sense doing something
I had long thought I would one day find myself doing. I left the
note lying where I had picked it up.</p>

<p>The palace seemed quiet. I supposed most people were preparing
for dinner. I ascended to the roof-floor. The servants who had
their rooms up here would all be busy just now, and probably nobody
would see me as I flitted by. Also, this way to the old Suitor's
Wing was shorter. For somebody who was not thinking about what he
was doing, I was thinking remarkably clearly.</p>

<p>I descended to the dark confines of the Little Court by the
servants' stairs and skirted the corner of the old North Wing (now
in the southern part of the palace) by the light of Foy, Iparine
and Jairly. Lamps burned in the distant windows of the main part of
the palace, pointing my way for a few steps before the light was
eclipsed by the shuttered fa&ccedil;ade of the old North Wing. Like
the Suitor's Wing, this would not normally be used at this time of
year unless there was a great state occasion. The Suitor's Wing
looked shuttered and dark, too, save for one sliver of light
showing at the edge of the main doorway. I kept to the two-thirds
darkness at the foot of the old North Wing's wall as I approached,
and felt exposed beneath the single intrusive eye of Jairly.</p>

<p>With the King in residence, there were supposed to be regular
guard patrols, even here where there would not normally be anybody.
I had seen no hint of any guards so far, and had no idea how often
they made their rounds, or indeed if they really did bother with
this part of the palace, but even knowing that men of the palace
guard might appear made me more nervous than I felt I really ought
to be. What had I to hide? Was I not a good and faithful servant,
and devoted to the King? Yet, here I was, quite consciously
skulking.</p>

<p>I would have to cross another courtyard in the light of the
three moons if I were to use the main entrance of the Suitor's
Wing, but even without thinking about it I knew I did not want to
use that front entrance. Then I found what I recalled ought to be
here &mdash; a way which led beneath the North Wing to a smaller
galleried courtyard within. There were gates at the far end, just
visible in the gloom of the tunnel, but they were open. The narrow
courtyard was silent and ghostly. The painted gallery posts looked
like stiff white sentries watching me. I took the small tunnel on
the far side of the court, also gated but not locked, and one left
turn later found myself at the rear of the Suitor's Wing, in the
shadow of all three moons, with the building's wooden-shuttered
facade tall and blank and dark above me.</p>

<p>I stood there, wondering how I was going to get in, then walked
along until I found a doorway. The door would be locked, I thought,
but then when I tried it, it was not. Now why should that be? I
pulled the slab of wood slowly to me, expecting it to creak, but it
did not.</p>

<p>The darkness inside was complete. The door closed behind me with
a soft thud. I had to feel my way along the corridor inside, one
hand on the wall to my right, my other hand out in front of my
face. These would be the servants' quarters. The floor under my
feet was naked stone. I passed several doors. They were all locked,
save for one which gave access to a large, empty cupboard with a
faint acrid, acidic smell which made me suspect it had once
contained soap. I banged my hand on one of its shelves and almost
swore out loud.</p>

<p>Back in the corridor again, I came to a wooden stairway. I crept
upwards and came to a door. From the bottom of the door there was
the very faintest suggestion of light, hinted at only when I did
not look directly at it. I twisted the handle carefully and pulled
the door towards me, for less than a hand's width.</p>

<p>Down a broad, carpeted corridor lined with paintings I could see
that the source of the light was a room at the far end, near the
main doorway. I heard a cry and what might have been the sound of a
scuffle, and then another cry. Footsteps sounded in the distance,
and the light in the doorway changed an instant before a figure
appeared there. It was a man. That was about all I could ever be
sure of. The fellow came running down the corridor, straight
towards me.</p>

<p>It took me a moment to realise that he might actually be heading
for the door I was hiding behind. In that time he covered about
half the length of the corridor. There was something wild and
desperate about him that put a terror into me.</p>

<p>I turned and jumped down the dark stairs, landing heavily and
hurting my left ankle. I stumbled towards where I thought the
unlocked cupboard door ought to be. My hands flailed around the
wall for a moment until I found the door, then I pulled it open and
threw myself inside just as a bang and a thin wash of light
announced that the man had thrown open the door at the top of the
stairs. Heavy footsteps clattered down.</p>

<p>I leant back against the shelves. I put my hand out towards the
swinging shadow of the cupboard door to pull it back, but it was
out of my reach. The man must have run into it, for there was a
loud bang and a yelp of pain and anger. The cupboard door slammed
shut and I was left in darkness. Another, heavier door slammed
somewhere outside and a key rattled in a lock.</p>

<p>I pushed the cupboard door open. A small amount of light was
still falling down the stairway. I heard some noise from the top of
the stairs but it sounded distant. It might have been a door
closing. I went back to the top of the steps and looked out through
the half-open door. Down the broad corridor, the light changed
again in the doorway near the main entrance at the far end. I got
ready to run again, but nobody appeared. Instead there was a
stifled cry. A woman's cry. A terrible fear shook me then, and I
started to walk down the corridor.</p>

<p>I had gone perhaps five or six steps when the main doors at the
far end of the hall were thrown open and a troop of guards rushed
in, swords drawn. Two of them stopped and looked at me, while the
rest made straight for the door where the light was coming
from.</p>

<p>'You! Here!' one of the guards shouted, pointing his sword at
me.</p>

<p>Shouts, and a woman's frightened voice, came from the lit room.
I walked on trembling legs down the hall towards the guards. I was
grabbed by the collar and forced into the room, where the Doctor
was being held by two tall guardsmen, her arms pinned, forced back
against a wall. She was shouting at the men.</p>

<p>Duke Ormin lay motionless on his back on the floor, in a huge
pool of dark blood. His throat had been cut. A thin, flattened
metal shaft protruded from above his heart. The flat metal shaft
was the handle of a thin knife made all of metal. I recognised it.
It was one of the Doctor's scalpels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think I lost the power of speech for a while. I lost the power
of hearing too, I believe. The Doctor was still shouting at the
men. Then she saw me and shouted at me, but I could not make out
what it was she was shouting. I would have fallen to the floor had
I not been supported by the scruff of the neck by the two guards
holding me. One of the guardsmen knelt by the body on the floor. He
had to kneel at the head of the Duke to avoid the still spreading
pool of darkness on the wooden floor. He opened one of Duke Ormin's
eyes.</p>

<p>A piece of my brain still functioning told me that if he was
checking for signs of life this was a foolish thing to do, given
the amount of blood that had flowed over the floor, and the quite
stationary shaft of the scalpel protruding from the Duke's
chest.</p>

<p>The guardsman said something. I have a feeling it was 'Dead' or
something similar, but I cannot recall.</p>

<p>Then there were more guards in the room, until it became quite
crowded and I could not see the Doctor.</p>

<p>We were taken away. I did not hear things properly again, or
find my own voice until we arrived at our destination, back at the
main palace, in the torture chamber, where Duke Quettil's chief
questioner, Master Ralinge, was waiting for us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Master, I knew then that you must forsake me. Perhaps I was not
supposed to be forsaken, according to the original plan, for that
note, purportedly from you, did use the word 'privately' which
implied that the Doctor was to go alone, and not take me along with
her, so I could believe that I had been supposed to remain innocent
of whatever the Doctor was accused of. But I had followed her, and
I had not thought to tell anybody else of my fears.</p>

<p>I also had not thought to stand my ground when the man who must
have been the real murderer of Duke Ormin came thundering down the
hall towards me. No, instead I had taken flight, jumping down the
stairs and hiding in a cupboard. Even when the fellow had banged
into the cupboard door, I had stayed back against the shelves of
the cupboard, hoping he would not look inside and discover me. So I
was complicit with my own downfall, I realised, as I was brought
struggling into the chamber where last the Doctor and I had been
that night when we had been summoned by Master Nolieti.</p>

<p>The Doctor, for those moments, was magnificent.</p>

<p>She walked erect, her back straight, her head raised. I had to
be dragged, because my legs had entirely stopped working. I think,
for myself, that had I had the wit I would have shouted and
screamed and struggled, but I was too stunned. There was a look on
the Doctor's proud face of resignation and defeat, but not of panic
or fear. I was not so deceived as to imagine for a moment that I
appeared to be anything other than the way I felt, which was
shaking and quivering with abject terror, my limbs reduced to
jelly.</p>

<p>Do I shame myself to say that I had soiled my breeches? I think
I do not. Master Ralinge was an acknowledged virtuoso of pain.</p>

<p>The torture chamber.</p>

<p>It seemed very well lit, I thought. The walls were studded with
torches and candles. Master Ralinge must prefer being able to see
what he was doing. Nolieti had favoured a darker and more menacing
atmosphere.</p>

<p>I was already preparing myself to denounce the Doctor and all
her works. I looked at the rack, the cage, the bath, the brazier,
the bed, the pokers and pincers and all the rest of the equipment,
and my love, my devotion, my honour itself turned to water and
drained out through my heels. Whatever it was required of me to
say, I would say, to save myself.</p>

<p>The Doctor was doomed, of that I was certain. Nothing I could do
or say would save her. Her actions had been arranged to fit this
accusation. The suspicious note, the odd locale, the route left
open for the real murderer, the timely appearance of the guard, so
mob-handed, even the fact that Master Ralinge looked so bright-eyed
and happy to see us and had arranged and lit all his candles and
stoked his brazier . . . all spoke of arrangement, of collusion.
The Doctor had been forced to this by people capable of wielding
great power, and therefore there was absolutely nothing I could
possibly do that would save her from her fate or in any way
mitigate her punishment.</p>

<p>Those of you who read this and think, Well, I would have done
whatever I could to have reduced her torment, I beg you think
again, for you have not been marched into a torture chamber to see
the instruments there waiting for you. When you see those, you
think only of a way to stop them being used against you.</p>

<p>The Doctor was taken, without a struggle, to a floor sink, where
she was forced to kneel while her hair was cut off and her head
shaved. That seemed to upset her, for she started to shout and
scream. Master Ralinge did the cutting and shaving himself, in a
loving, careful way. He bunched in his fist, brought to his nose
and slowly sniffed each bundle of hair he removed from the Doctor's
head. I meanwhile was strapped upright to an iron frame.</p>

<p>I cannot recall what the Doctor screamed or what Master Ralinge
said. I know they exchanged words, that is all. The master
torturer's motley collection of mismatched teeth gleamed in the
candle light.</p>

<p>Ralinge ran his hand over the Doctor's head, and at one place,
over her left ear, his hands stopped and he looked more closely,
muttering in his soft voice something which I could not make out,
then he ordered her stripped and placed on an iron bed by the
brazier. As the Doctor was manhandled by the two guards who had
brought her to this awful place, the torturer slowly undid and
pulled off his thick leather apron, and then began to unbutton his
trousers in a deliberate, reverential manner. He watched the two
guards &mdash; four eventually, for the Doctor put up a remarkably
powerful fight &mdash; as they stripped my mistress naked.</p>

<p>And so I saw what I had always hoped to see, and was able to
view what I had envisaged during many hundreds of shameful
soporific imaginings.</p>

<p>The Doctor, nude.</p>

<p>And it meant nothing. She was struggling, pulling and heaving
and trying to punch and kick and bite, her skin mottled with
exertion, her face hot with tears and reddened with fear and fury.
This was no soft dream of lust. Here was no emollient vision of
loveliness. Here was a woman about to be violated in the most base
and disgusting ways possible, and then tortured, and then,
eventually, killed. She knew this as well as I, and as well as
Ralinge and his pair of assistants did, and as well as the guards
who attended us.</p>

<p>What was my most fervent hope at that point?</p>

<p>It was that they did not know of my devotion to her. If they
thought me indifferent, I might only hear her screams. If they
thought for a moment, for the merest heart-beat, that I loved her,
then the very rules of their profession would require that my
eyelids be cut out and I would be forced to watch her every
torment.</p>

<p>Her clothes were thrown away, landing in a heap in one corner by
a bench. Something clinked. Master Ralinge looked at the Doctor as
she was secured, quite naked, to the iron bed frame. He. looked
down at his manhood, stroking it, then he dismissed the guards.
They looked both disappointed and relieved. One of Ralinge's
assistants locked the chamber door behind them. There was upon
Ralinge's face a bright and shining, almost luminescent smile as he
moved towards her.</p>

<p>The Doctor's dark clothes settled where they had fallen.</p>

<p>My eyes filled with tears, thinking of how she had thought to
check her progress as she had left her apartments, being so careful
as to go back and pick up that stupid, blunt and useless dagger
that she carried with her whenever she remembered. What good could
that do her now?</p>

<p>Master Ralinge said the first words that I could recall in
detail since the Doctor had read out the note in her apartments,
half a bell &mdash; and an entire age &mdash; earlier.</p>

<p>'First things first, madam,' he said. He climbed up on to the
bed the Doctor had been strapped to, his swollen manhood held
poised within one fist.</p>

<p>The Doctor looked into his eyes quite calmly. She made a
clicking noise with her mouth and her face took on a look of
disappointment. 'Ah,' she said, matter-of-factly. 'So you are
serious.' And she smiled. Smiled!</p>

<p>Then she said something that sounded like an instruction in a
language I did not know. It was not the language she had used with
the gaan Kuduhn, a day earlier. It was a different kind of
language. A language from somewhere, I thought, even as I heard it
and closed my eyes &mdash; for I could not bear to see what was going to
happen next &mdash; beyond even far Drezen. A language from nowhere.</p>


<p>And, well, what happened next?</p>


<p>How many times I have tried to explain it, how many times I have
attempted to make sense of it. Not so much for others, but for
myself.</p>

<p>My eyes &mdash; as I hope will seem understandable given the feelings
I lave attempted to imply through this journal &mdash; were closed at the
time. I simply did not see what happened during the next few
heart-beats.</p>

<p>I heard a whirring noise. A noise like a waterfall, a noise like
a sudden wind, like an arrow as it passes nearby one's ear. Then a
long gasp which I realised later must in reality have been two
gasps, but in any case a long exhalation of sound, and then a thud,
a punch-like concussion of what, in retrospect, was air and flesh
and bone and . . . what? More bone? Metal? Wood?</p>

<p>Metal, I think.</p>

<p>Who knows?</p>

<p>I felt a strange, dizzying sensation. I may have been senseless,
for a while. I do not know.</p>

<p>When I woke, if I woke, it was to something that was
impossible.</p>

<p>The Doctor stood over me, clad in her long white shirt. She was
bald, of course, having been shaved. She looked utterly different.
Alien.</p>

<p>She was undoing my bonds.</p>

<p>Her expression seemed cool and assured. Her face and scalp were
freckled with red.</p>

<p>There was red on the ceiling above the iron bed where she had
been secured. More blood was scattered almost everywhere I looked,
some of it still dripping from the nearby bench. I looked at the
floor. Master Ralinge lay there. Or most of him did. His body, up
to his lower neck, lay on the stones, still twitching. Where the
rest was . . . well, there were quite sufficient pieces of red,
pink and grey distributed around the chamber for one to re-create
something like what must have happened to his upper neck and
head.</p>

<p>Simply, it was as though a bomb had exploded inside it. I could
see half a dozen teeth of various sizes and colours scattered about
the floor, like shrapnel.</p>

<p>Ralinge's assistants lay nearby in a single great spreading pool
of blood, their heads almost severed from their bodies. Only a
strip of skin still connected the head of one to his shoulders. His
face was turned towards me and his eyes were still open.</p>


<p>I swear, they blinked, once. Then they slowly closed.</p>

<p>The Doctor released me.</p>


<p>Something moved at the hem of her loose shirt. Then the movement
stopped.</p>

<p>She looked so steady and so certain. And yet she looked so dead,
so utterly overpowered. She turned her head to one side and said
something in a tone I swear to this day was resigned and defeated,
even bitter. Something buzzed through the air.</p>

<p>'We must imprison ourselves to save ourselves, Oelph,' she told
me. She put her hand on my mouth. 'If that is possible.'</p>

<p>Warm and dry and strong.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were in a cell. A cell set within the walls of the torture
chamber and separated from it by a grid of iron bars. Why she put
us in here, I had no idea. The Doctor had dressed herself. I had
hurriedly undressed while she looked away, cleaned myself as best I
could, then dressed again. Meanwhile she had gathered up the long
red hair Ralinge had shaved from her head. She looked at it
regretfully as she stepped over the master torturer's body, then
threw the gleaming red bundles on to the brazier, where they
crackled and spat and smoked and flamed and gave off a sickening
smell.</p>

<p>She had quietly unlocked the door of the chamber itself, before
putting us both in this small cell, locking the door from outside
and throwing the keys on to the nearest bench. Then she had sat
calmly down on the dirty straw floor and put her arms round her
knees and stared blankly out at the carnage in the chamber
outside.</p>

<p>I squatted down beside her, my knee close to where her old
dagger protruded from the top of her boot. The air smelled of shit
and burned hair and something sharp that I decided must be blood. I
felt sick for a little while. I tried to concentrate on something
trivial, and was inordinately grateful to find something. The
Doctor's old battered dagger had lost the last of its little white
beads round the top rim of its pommel, under the smoky stone. It
looked neater, more symmetrical now, I thought. I took a deep
breath through my mouth, to escape the smells of the torture
chamber, then cleared my throat. 'What . . . what happened,
mistress?' I asked.</p>

<p>'You must report what you feel you have to, Oelph.' Her voice
sounded tired and hollow. 'I shall say that the three of them fell
out over me, and killed each other. But it doesn't really matter.'
She looked at me. Her eyes seemed to drill into me. I had to look
away. 'What did you see, Oelph?' she asked.</p>

<p>'My eyes were closed, mistress. Truly. I heard . . . a few
noises. Wind. A buzz. A thud. I think I was out of my senses for a
short while.'</p>

<p>She nodded, and smiled thinly. 'Well, that's handy.'</p>

<p>'Should we not have attempted to run away, mistress?'</p>

<p>'I don't think we'd get very far, Oelph,' she said. 'There is
another way, but we must be patient. The matter is in hand.'</p>

<p>'If you say so, mistress,' I said. Suddenly my eyes filled with
tears. The Doctor turned to me and smiled. She looked very strange
and child-like with no hair. She put her arm out and hugged me to
her. I rested my head on her shoulder. She rested her head on mine,
and rocked me to and fro, like a mother with her child.</p>

<p>We were still like that when the chamber door burst open and the
guards rushed in. They stopped and stared at the three bodies lying
on the floor, then hurried on towards us. I shrank back, convinced
that our torment would shortly be resumed. The guards looked
relieved to see us, which I found surprising. One sergeant picked
up the keys from the bench where the Doctor had thrown them and
released us and told us that we were needed at once, for the King
was dying.</p>

<h3 class="chapter">22. THE BODYGUARD</h3>

<p>Still the Protector's son hung on to life. The convulsions and
his lack of appetite had left Lattens so weak he could barely lift
his head to drink. For a few mornings he seemed to be getting
better, but then he relapsed and seemed once again at the very door
of death.</p>

<p>UrLeyn was distraught. The servants reported that he raged round
his apartments, tearing sheets and pulling down tapestries and
smashing ornaments and furniture and slicing ancient portraits with
a knife. The servants started to clean up the destruction when he
went to visit Lattens on his sick bed, but when he returned UrLeyn
threw the servants out, and from then on he would let nobody into
his rooms.</p>

<p>The palace seemed a terrible, bleak place to be, the atmosphere
contaminated by the powerless fury and despair of the man at its
heart. UrLeyn remained in his wrecked apartments during this time,
only leaving to visit his son every morning and afternoon, and the
harem each evening, where he lay, usually with Perrund, collapsed
in her lap or bosom while she stroked his head until he fell
asleep. But such peace never lasted long, and he would soon twitch
in his sleep and cry out and then wake, and subsequently rise and
return to his own rooms, old and haggard-looking and sunk in
despair.</p>

<p>The bodyguard DeWar slept in a cot along the corridor from the
door to UrLeyn's rooms. For most of the day he would pace up and
down the same corridor, fretting and waiting for UrLeyn to make one
of his rare appearances.</p>

<p>The Protector's brother RuLeuin tried to see UrLeyn. He waited
patiently in the corridor with DeWar, then when UrLeyn appeared
from his apartments and walked quickly in the direction of his
son's room, RuLeuin Joined DeWar at UrLeyn's side and tried to talk
to his brother, but UrLeyn ignored him, and told DeWar not to let
RuLeuin or anybody else approach him until he ordered so.
YetAmidous, ZeSpiole and even Doctor BreDelle were all told this by
the bodyguard.</p>

<p>YetAmidous did not believe what he was being told. He thought
DeWar was trying to keep them all away from the General.</p>

<p>He too waited in the corridor one day, defying DeWar to force
him to leave. When the door to UrLeyn's apartments opened,
YetAmidous pushed past DeWar's outstretched arm and walked towards
the Protector, saying, 'General! I must talk to you!'</p>

<p>But UrLeyn just looked at him from the doorway, then without a
word closed the door from the inside before YetAmidous could get
there. The key turned in the lock. YetAmidous was left to fume in
the doorway, then he turned and walked away, ignoring DeWar.</p>

<p>'Will you really see no one, sir?' DeWar asked him as they
strode to Lattens' room one day.</p>

<p>He thought UrLeyn would not answer, but then he said, 'No.'</p>

<p>'They need to talk to you about the war, sir.'</p>

<p>'Do they?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'How goes the war?'</p>

<p>'Not well, sir.'</p>

<p>'Well, not well. What does it matter? Tell them to do whatever
has to be done. I do not care to concern myself with it any
more.'</p>

<p>'With respect, sir&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Your respect for me will be expressed from now on by speaking
only when you are spoken to, DeWar.'</p>

<p>'Sir&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Sir!' UrLeyn said, whirling to face the younger man and forcing
him to retreat until his back was hard against a wall. 'You will
remain silent until I ask you to speak, or I will have you removed
from this building. Do you understand? You may answer yes or
no.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Very well. You are my bodyguard. You may guard my body. No
more. Come.'</p>

<p>The war was indeed going badly. It was common knowledge in the
palace that no more cities had been taken, and indeed that one had
been retaken by the barons' forces. If the message to try to
capture the barons themselves had got through, it was either not
being acted upon or was impossible to accomplish. Troops
disappeared into the lands of Ladenscion and only the walking
wounded seemed to return, with tales of confusion and horror. The
citizens of Crough began to wonder when the men who had been sent
to the conflict might return, and started to complain about the
extra taxes which had been levied to pay for the war.</p>

<p>The generals at the war itself called for more troops, but there
were scarcely any troops left to send. The palace guard had been
halved, with one half being formed into a company of pikemen and
sent off to the war. Even the eunuchs of the harem guard had been
pressed into service. The generals and others who were attempting
to administer the land and run the war while UrLeyn closeted
himself away did not know what to do. It was rumoured that Guard
Commander ZeSpiole had suggested that the only thing to do might be
to bring all the troops home, to burn all that could be burned of
Ladenscion and leave it to the damned barons. It was also rumoured
that when ZeSpiole suggested this, at the table where UrLeyn had
held his last council of war half a moon earlier, General
YetAmidous had let out a terrible roar and, leaping to his feet and
drawing his sword, swore he would cut out the tongue of the next
man to betray UrLeyn's wishes and suggest such cowardice.</p>

<p>DeWar came to the harem's outer room one morning, and requested
that the lady Perrund attend him.</p>

<p>'Mr DeWar,' she said, sitting on a couch. He sat down on another
couch across a small table from her.</p>

<p>He gestured at a wooden box and a game board, lying on the
table. 'I thought we might play a game of "Leader's Dispute". Would
you humour me?'</p>

<p>'Gladly,' Perrund said. They unfolded the board and set out the
pieces.</p>

<p>'What is the news?' she asked, as they commenced playing.</p>

<p>'Of the boy, no change,' DeWar said, sighing. 'The nurse says he
slept a little better last night, but he barely recognises his
father and when he talks he makes no sense. From the war, there is
news of change, but all of it's ill. I fear the whole thing has
gone wrong. The latest reports were confused, but it sounds as
though Simalg and Ralboute are both retreating. If it is only a
retreat there may still be some hope, but the nature of the reports
themselves makes me think it may in reality be a rout, or well on
the way to becoming one.'</p>

<p>Perrund stared at the man wide-eyed. 'Providence, can it really
be that bad?'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid it can.'</p>

<p>'Is Tassasen itself in danger?'</p>

<p>'I would hope not. The barons ought not to have the military
wherewithal to invade us, and there should be sufficient troops
intact to mount an adequate defence if they did, but . . .'</p>

<p>'Oh, DeWar, it sounds hopeless.' She looked into his eyes. 'Does
UrLeyn know?'</p>

<p>DeWar shook his head. 'He will not be told. But YetAmidous and
RuLeuin are talking about waiting outside Lattens' room this
afternoon and demanding that he listen to them.'</p>

<p>'Do you think he will?'</p>

<p>'I think he might. I also think he might run away from them, or
order the guards to throw them out, or run them through, or strike
at them himself.' DeWar picked up his Protector piece and turned it
round in his fingers before replacing it on the board. 'I don't
know what he'll do. I hope he will listen to them. I hope he will
begin to act normally again and start to rule, as he ought. He
cannot go on like this much longer without those in the war cabinet
starting to think that they'd be better off without him.' He looked
into Perrund's widened eyes. 'I cannot talk to him,' he told her.
She thought he sounded like a small, hurt boy. 'I am literally
forbidden to. If I thought I could say something to him, I would,
but he has threatened that if I try to speak to him without his
express permission he will have me removed from my position, and I
think I believe him. So if I am to continue trying to protect him,
I must remain silent. Yet he must be told what a pass things have
come to. If YetAmidous and RuLeuin do not succeed this
afternoon&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Will I, tonight?' Perrund said, her voice sharp.</p>

<p>DeWar looked down for a moment, then he met her gaze again. 'I
am sorry to have to ask you, Perrund. I can only ask. I would not
even think of doing so if the situation were anything less than
desperate. But desperate it is.'</p>

<p>'He may not choose to listen to a crippled concubine,
DeWar.'</p>

<p>'At the moment, Perrund, there is nobody else. Will you make the
attempt?'</p>

<p>'Of course. What ought I to say?'</p>

<p>'What I have told you. That the war is on the verge of being
lost. Ralboute and Simalg are retreating, that we can only hope
that they are doing so in good order but the hints we have indicate
otherwise. Tell him that his war cabinet is at odds with itself,
that its members cannot decide what to do, and the only thing they
may eventually agree on is that a leader who will not lead is less
than worthless. He must regain their trust and respect before it is
too late. The city, the country itself is starting to turn against
him. There is discontent and wild talk of harbingers of
catastrophe, and the beginning of a dangerous nostalgia for what
people call "the old days". Tell him as much as he can bear of
that, my lady, or as much as you dare, but be careful. He has
raised his hand to his servants before now, and I will not be there
to protect you, or him from himself.'</p>

<p>Perrund gazed levelly at him. 'This is a heavy duty, DeWar.'</p>

<p>'It is. And I am sorry to have to offer it to you, but the
moment has become critical. If there is anything at all I can do to
help you in this, you have only to ask and it will be done if I can
possibly do it.'</p>

<p>Perrund took a deep breath. She looked at the game board. With a
faltering smile she waved her hand at the pieces between them and
said, 'Well, you could move.' </p>

<p>His small, sad smile matched
hers.</p>

<h3 class="chapter">23. THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p>The Doctor and I stood on the quayside. About us was all the
usual tumult of the docks, and, in addition, the local confusion
which normally attends upon a great ship preparing to depart on a
long voyage. The galleon Plough <em>of the Seas</em> was due to
sail with the next doubled tide in less than half a bell, and the
last supplies were being hoisted and carried aboard, while
everywhere about us, amongst the coils of rope, the barrels of tar, the piled rolls
of wicker fenders and flatly emptied carts were played out tearful
scenes of farewell. Ours, of course, was one.</p>

<p>'Mistress, can you not stay? Please?' I begged her. The tears
rolled miserably down my cheeks for all to see.</p>

<p>The Doctor's face was tired, resigned and calm. Her eyes had a
fractured, far-away look about them, like ice or broken glass
glimpsed in the dark recesses of a distant room. Her hat was pulled
tight over her brindled scalp. I thought she had never looked so
beautiful. The day was blustery, the wind was warm and the two suns
shone down from either side of the sky, opposing and unequal points
of view. I was Seigen to her Xamis, the desperate light of my
desire to have her stay entirely washed out by the bounteous blaze
of her will to leave.</p>

<p>She took my hands in hers. The broken-looking eyes gazed
tenderly upon me for the last time. I tried to blink my tears out
of the way, resolved that if I would never see her again, at least
my last sight of her would be vivid and sharp. 'I can't, Oelph, I'm
sorry.'</p>

<p>'Can't I come with you then, mistress?' I said, even more
miserably. This was my last and most dismal play. It had been the
one thing I had been determined not to say, because it was so
obvious and so pathetic and so doomed. I had known she would be
leaving for a half-moon or so, and in those few handfuls of days I
had tried everything I could think of to make her want to stay,
even while knowing that her going was inevitable and that none of
my arguments could carry any weight with her, not measured against
what she saw as her failure. During all that time I wanted to say,
Then if you must go, please take me!</p>

<p>But it was too sad a thing to say, too predictable. Of course
that is what I would say, and of course she would turn me down. I
was a youth, still, and she a woman of maturity and wisdom. What
would I do, if I went with her, but remind her of what she had
lost, of how she had failed? She would look at me and see the King
and never forgive me for not being him, for reminding her that she
had lost his love even if she had saved his life.</p>

<p>I knew she would reject me if I said it, so I had made an
absolutely firm decision not to ask her. It would be the one piece
of my self-respect I would retain. But some inflamed part of my
mind said, She might say Yes! She might have been waiting for you
to ask! Perhaps (this seductive, insane, deluded, sweet voice
within me said) she really does love you, and would want nothing
more than to take you with her, back to Drezen. Perhaps she feels
that it is not for her to ask you, because it would be taking you
away from everything and everyone you have ever known, perhaps for
ever, perhaps never to return.</p>

<p>And so, like a fool, I did ask her, and she only squeezed my
hands and shook her head. 'I would let you if it was possible,
Oelph,' she said quietly. 'It is so sweet of you to want to
accompany me. I shall cherish always the memory of that kindness.
But I cannot ask you to come with me.'</p>

<p>'I would go anywhere with you, mistress!' I cried, my eyes now
full of tears. I would have thrown myself at her feet and hugged
her legs if I had been able to see properly. Instead I hung my head
and blubbered like a child. 'Please, mistress, please, mistress,' I
wept, no longer even able to say what it was I wanted, her to stay
or me to go.</p>

<p>'Oh, Oelph, I was trying so hard not to cry,' she said, then
gathered me in her arms and folded me to her.</p>

<p>At last to be held in her arms, pressed against her, and be
allowed to put my arms round her, feeling her warmth and her
strength, encompassing her firm softness, drawing in that fresh
perfume from her skin. She put her chin on my shoulder, just as
mine rested on hers. Between my sobs, I could feel her shake,
crying too, now. I had last been this close to her, side by side,
my head on her shoulder, her head on mine, in the torture chamber
of the palace, half a moon earlier, when the guards had tumbled in
with the news that we were needed because the King was dying.</p>

<p class="chapter"><em>*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>*</em></p>


<p>The King was indeed dying. A terrible sickness had fallen upon
him from nowhere, causing him to collapse during a dinner being
held for the suddenly, and secretly, arrived Duke Quettil. King
Quience had been in the middle of a sentence, when he stopped
speaking, stared straight ahead and started to shake. His eyes had
revolved back into his head and he had slumped down in his seat,
unconscious, the wine goblet dropping froze his hand.</p>

<p>Skelim, Quettil's doctor, was there. He had had to remove the
King's tongue from his throat, or he would have choked to death
immediately. Instead he lay there on the floor, senseless and
shaking spasmodically while everybody rushed around. Duke Quettil
attempted to take charge, apparently ordering that guards be posted
everywhere. Duke Ulresile contented himself with staring, while the
new Duke Walen sat in his seat, whimpering. Guard Commander Adlain
posted a guard at the King's table to make sure nobody touched the
King's plate or the decanter he'd been drinking from, in case
somebody had poisoned him.</p>

<p>During all this commotion, a servant arrived with the news that
Duke Ormin had been murdered.</p>

<p>My thoughts, oddly, have turned to that footman whenever I have
tried to envisage the scene. A servant rarely gets to deliver
genuinely shocking news to those of exalted rank, and to be
entrusted with something as momentous as the intelligence that one
of the King's favourites has taken the life of a Duke must seem
like something of a privilege. To discover that it is of relatively
little consequence compared to the events unfolding before you must
be galling.</p>

<p>I was, subsequently, more than usually diligent in quizzing, as
subtly as I could, the servants who were in the dining chamber that
evening, and they reported that, even at the time, they noticed
that certain of the dining guests did not react as one might have
expected to the news, presumably just because of the distraction of
the King's sudden predicament. It was almost, they hazarded, as
though the Guard Commander and the Dukes Ulresile and Quettil had
been expecting the news.</p>

<p>Doctor Skelim ordered that the King be taken directly to his
bed. Once there he was undressed. Skelim inspected the King's body
for any marks that might indicate he had been shot with a poisoned
dart or infected with something through a cut. There were none.</p>

<p>The King's blood pulse was slow and becoming slower, only
increasing briefly when small fits passed through him. Doctor
Skelim reported that unless something could be done, the King's
heart was sure to stop within the bell. He confessed himself at a
loss to determine what had befallen the King. The doctor's bag was
delivered from his room by a breathless servant, but the few tonics
and stimulants he was able to administer (little better than
smelling salts by the sound of them, especially given that Quience
could not be induced to swallow anything) had no effect
whatsoever.</p>

<p>The doctor considered bleeding the King, in effect the only
thing he could think of which he had not tried, but bleeding
somebody with a weakening heartbeat had proved worse than useless
in the past, and on this occasion, thankfully, the urge not to make
matters worse overcame the need to be seen to be doing something.
The doctor ordered some exotic infusions to be prepared, but held
out little hope that they would be any more effective than the
compounds he had already administered.</p>

<p>It was you, master, who said that Doctor Vosill would have to be
summoned. I am told that Duke Ulresile and Duke Quettil took you
aside and that there was a furious argument. Duke Ulresile flew
from the room in a blinding rage and later took a sword to one of
his servants such that the poor fellow lost one eye and a pair of
fingers. I find it admirable that you stood your ground. A
contingent of the palace guards was sent to the questioning chamber
with orders to take the Doctor from there by force if
necessary.</p>

<p>I am told that my mistress walked calmly in to the terrified
confusion that was the King's chamber, where nobles, servants and,
it seemed, half the palace were assembled, crying and wailing.</p>

<p>She had sent me, with a pair of guards, to her chamber for her
medicine bag. We surprised one of Duke Quettil's servants and
another palace guard there. Both looked anxious and guilty at being
caught in the Doctor's rooms. Duke Quettil's man held a piece of
paper I recognised.</p>

<p>I have never, I think, been so proud of myself for anything I
have done in my life as for what I did next, for I was still half
terrified that my ordeal had merely been postponed rather than
cancelled. I was shaking and sweating with the shock of what I had
witnessed, I was mortified at the callow and cowardly way I had
felt in the torture chamber, ashamed of how my body had betrayed
me, and my mind was still spinning.</p>


<p>What I did was take the note from Quettil's servant.</p>


<p>'That is the property of my <em>mistress</em>!' I hissed, and stepped
forward, a look of fury on my face. I grabbed the note from the
fellow's fingers. He looked blankly at me, then at the note, which
I stuffed quickly into my shirt. He opened his mouth to speak. I
turned, still quivering with rage, to the two guards who had been
sent with me. 'Escort this person from these apartments
immediately!' I said.</p>

<p>This was, of course, a gamble on my part. In all the excitement,
it had been quite unclear whether the Doctor and I were still
technically prisoners or not, and therefore the two guards might
rightly have concluded that they were my jailers, not my
bodyguards, which was the way I was treating them. I would modestly
claim that they were able to recognise something transparently
honest and true about my righteous indignation and so decided to do
as I commanded.</p>


<p>The Duke's man looked terrified, but did as he was told.</p>


<p>I buttoned up my jacket to further secure the note, found the
Doctor's bag and hurried to the King's chamber with my escorts.</p>

<p>The Doctor had turned the King on to his side. She knelt by his
bed, stroking his head in a distracted way, fending off questions
from Doctor Skelim. (A reaction to something in his food, probably,
she told him. Extreme, but not poison.)</p>

<p>You stood, master, arms crossed, near the Doctor. Duke Quettil
lurked in a corner, glaring at her.</p>

<p>She took a small stoppered glass vial from the bag, holding it
up to the light and shaking it. 'Oelph, this is the salts solution
number twenty-one, herbed. Do you know it?'</p>


<p>I thought. 'Yes, mistress.'</p>


<p>'We'll need more, dried, within the next two bells. Can you
remember how to prepare it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I think so, mistress. I may need to refer to our
notes.'</p>

<p>'Just so. I'm sure your two guards will help you. Off you go,
then.'</p>

<p>I turned to go, then stopped and handed her the note which I had
taken from the Duke's man. 'Here is that paper, mistress,' I said
then quickly turned and left before she had time to ask me what it
was.</p>

<p>I missed the uproar when the Doctor pinched the King's nose and
clamped a hand over his mouth until he turned nearly blue. You,
master, held back the protestations of the others, but then grew
concerned yourself, and were about to order her away at sword point
when she let the King's nose go and thrust the powder which the
vial had contained under his nostrils. The ruddy powder looked like
dried blood, but was not. It whistled into the King as he took a
huge, deep in-drawing breath.</p>

<p>Most of the people in the room took their own first breath for
some time. For a while, nothing happened. Then, I am told, the
King's eyes flickered and opened. He saw the Doctor and smiled,
then coughed and wheezed and had to be helped to sit up.</p>

<p>He cleared his throat, fixed the Doctor with an outraged stare
and said, 'Vosill, what in the skies of hell have you done to your
hair?'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the Doctor knew she would not need any more of salts
solution number twenty-one, herbed. It was her way of trying to
make sure that she and I were not brought to the King, made to cure
him of whatever had befallen him and then promptly led away again
back to the torture chamber. She wanted people to think that the
course of treatment required would be longer than what amounted to
little more than a quick pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I returned to the Doctor's apartments, with my two
guards in escort, and set up the equipment necessary to produce the
powder. Even with the help of the two guards &mdash; and it was a
refreshing experience to be able to do the ordering around, rather
than to be subject to it myself &mdash; it would be a close-run thing to
produce a small amount of the substance in less than two bells. At
least it would give me something to do.</p>

<p>I only heard later and at second hand about the outburst of Duke
Quettil, in the King's chamber. The sergeant of the guards who had
released us from the cell in the torture chamber spoke quietly with
you, master, shortly after the King was brought back to the land of
the living. I am told you looked a little shaken for a moment, but
then went, grim-faced, to inform Duke Quettil of the fate of his
chief questioner and his two assistants.</p>

<p>'Dead! <em>Dead? By</em> fuck, Adlain, can you arrange nothing
right!' were the Duke's precise words, by all accounts. The King
glared. The Doctor looked unperturbed. Everybody else stared. The
Duke attempted to strike you, and had to be restrained by two of
your men, who acted, perhaps, before they thought. The King
inquired what was going on.</p>

<p>The Doctor, meanwhile, was looking at the piece of paper I had
given her.</p>

<p>It was the note that purported to be from you and which had
lured her to the trap that had killed Duke Ormin and was supposed
to dispose of her. The King had already heard from the Doctor that
Ormin was dead, and that she had been meant to appear to be the
killer. He was still sitting up in bed, staring ahead and trying to
digest this news. The Doctor had not yet given him the details of
what had supposedly happened in the questioning chamber, but merely
said that she had been released before being put to the
question.</p>

<p>She showed him the note. He called you over and you confirmed
that it was not your writing, though it might be said to be a
decent attempt at it.</p>

<p>Duke Quettil took the opportunity to demand that somebody be
brought to justice for the murder of his men, which may have been a
little hasty, as it raised the question concerning what they had
been doing there in the first place. The King's expression darkened
as he gradually took in all that was revealed, and several times he
had to tell people trying to interrupt others to stop, so that he
could get clear in his still slightly befuddled head what had
actually happened. Duke Quettil, reportedly breathing heavily and
with staring eyes and spittle on his lips, at one point attempted
to grab the Doctor's wrist and pull her away from the King, who put
his arm round her shoulders and ordered you to keep the Duke
distant.</p>

<p>I was absent for all that passed over the next half bell. What I
know was passed to me by others, and so must surrender the toll
which information tends to pay when it passes through the minds and
memories of others. Even so, without having been there, I believe
there was some quick thinking done in that chamber, principally by
yourself, though Duke Quettil must, at the least, have calmed down
sufficiently to consider things in a more rational manner again and
accept the path you were mapping out, even if he could contribute
little of the cartography himself.</p>

<p>The brief of it was that Duke Ulresile was to be blamed. The
writing on the note was his. The palace guards swore that Ulresile
had commanded them on your authority. Later that night one of
Ulresile's men was brought before the King, sobbing, to confess
that he had stolen the scalpel from the Doctor's apartments earlier
that day and that he had killed Duke Ormin, then run away and out
of a back door of the Suitor's Wing shortly before the Doctor
entered by the front door. I was able to play my part, averring
that the fellow could well have been the man who had rushed towards
me in the dim corridor in the Suitor's Wing.</p>

<p>The fellow lied about the scalpel, of course. Only one of the
instruments had ever gone missing and that was the one I had stolen
two seasons earlier, the day we had visited the Poor Hospital. Of
course, I delivered it into your hands, master, though not in the
literal sense in which it was later delivered into the body of Duke
Ormin.</p>

<p>Duke Ulresile, in the meantime, had been prevailed upon to
remove himself from the palace. I think a more mature mind might
have thought this through and realised that to fly so was to appear
to confirm any accusations that might be levelled at him, but
perhaps he did not think to compare his predicament or possible
actions with one so base as poor, dead Unoure. In any event, he was
funnel-fed some story about the King's displeasure being great but
brief and largely a matter of a misunderstanding which Quettil and
yourself, master, would need a short period to sort out, but a
short period which absolutely required the young Duke's
absence.</p>

<p>The King made it very clear that he would take any further
attempt to traduce the Doctor's good name very ill indeed. You
promised that everything would be done to clear up the remaining
points of confusion in the matter.</p>

<p class="chapter"><em>*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>*</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>*</em></p>


<p>Two of the King's own guards were stationed outside our
apartments that night. I slept soundly in my cell until woken by a
nightmare. I think the Doctor slept well. In the morning she looked
well enough. She completed shaving her head, making a neater job of
it than Master Ralinge.</p>

<p>I assisted her in this, in her bedroom while she sat on a chair
with a towel round her shoulders and a basin on her knees in which
warm suds and a sponge floated. We were due to attend another
meeting in the King's chamber that morning, the better to give our
side of the events of the previous night.</p>

<p>'What did happen, mistress?' I asked her.</p>

<p>'Where and when, Oelph?' she asked, moistening her scalp with
the sponge and then scraping at it with a scalpel &mdash; of all things &mdash;
before passing it to me to complete the job.</p>

<p>'In the questioning chamber, mistress. What happened to Ralinge
and the other two?'</p>

<p>'They fought over who would have me first, Oelph. Don't you
remember?'</p>

<p>'I do not, mistress,' I whispered, with a look round at the door
through to her workshop. It was locked, like the one beyond and the
one beyond that, but still I felt frightened, as well as a sort of
anguished guilt. 'I saw Master Ralinge about to . . .'</p>

<p>'About to rape me, Oelph. Please, Oelph. Steady with that
scalpel,' she said, and put her hand on my wrist. She lifted my
hand away a little from her naked scalp and looked round with a
smile. 'It would be too ironic to survive a false charge of murder
and be delivered from the very brink of torture only to suffer
injury by your hand.'</p>

<p>'But mistress!' I said, and I am not ashamed to say that I
wailed, for I was still convinced that we could not be surrounded
by such fatally cataclysmic events and such powerfully antagonistic
personages without attracting extreme harm. 'There was no time for
a dispute! He was about to take you! Providence, I saw him. I
closed my eyes a heartbeat before . . . there was no time!'</p>

<p>'Dear Oelph,' the Doctor said, keeping her hand on my wrist.
'You must have forgotten. You were unconscious for some time. Your
head rolled to one side, your body went limp. You fairly drooled,
I'm afraid. The three men had a fine old argument while you were
out of your senses, and then just as the pair who had killed
Ralinge slashed at each other, you woke up again. Don't you
remember?'</p>

<p>I looked into her eyes. Her expression was one I found
impossible to read. I was reminded suddenly of the mirror mask she
had worn at the ball in Yvenir palace. 'Is that what I ought to
remember, mistress?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Oelph, it is.'</p>

<p>I looked down at the scalpel and the gleaming mirror-surface of
its blade.</p>

<p>'But how did you come to be released from your bonds,
mistress?'</p>

<p>'Why, in his haste, Master Ralinge simply did not secure one of
them properly,' the Doctor said, releasing her grip of my wrist and
lowering her head again. 'A woeful lapse of professional standards,
but perhaps in a way a flattering one.'</p>

<p>I sighed. I picked up the soapy sponge and squeezed some more of
the suds on to the back of her head. 'I see, mistress,' I said
unhappily, and scraped away the very last of the hair on her
head.</p>

<p>I decided, as I did this, that perhaps my memory had been
playing tricks on me after all, because looking down at the
Doctor's legs, I could see her old dagger sticking out from the top
of her boot as usual, and there, quite plainly, was the little pale
stone on the top rim of the pommel I had been so convinced had been
absent yesterday, in the torture chamber.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think I knew already then there was no going back to the way
things had been before. Even so, it was a shock when the Doctor
paid a visit to the King by herself two days later and came back to
tell me that she had asked to be released from the post of his
personal physician. I stood and stared at her, still standing in
the midst of unpacked crates and boxes of supplies and ingredients
which she had continued to collect from the apothecaries and
chemicalists of the city.</p>

<p>'Released, mistress?' I asked, stupidly.</p>

<p>She nodded. I thought her eyes looked as if she had been crying.
'Yes, Oelph. I think it is for the best. I have been too long away
from Drezen. And the King seems generally well.'</p>

<p>'But he was at death's door not two nights ago!' I shouted,
unwilling to believe what I was hearing and what it meant.</p>

<p>She gave me one of her small smiles. 'I think that will not
occur again.'</p>

<p>'But you said it was caused by some &mdash; what did you call it? &mdash;
some allotropic galvanic of salt! Dammit all, woman, that could&mdash;
!'</p>

<p>'Oelph!'</p>

<p>I think it was the only time either of us spoke to each other in
quite such tones. I shrank from my fury like a punctured bladder. I
looked down at the floor. 'Sorry, mistress.'</p>

<p>'I am quite sure,' she told me firmly, 'that will not occur
again.</p>

<p>'Yes, mistress,' I mumbled.</p>

<p>'You might as well pack this lot back up again.'</p>

<p<&nbsp;/</p>

<p>A bell later I was in the depths of my misery, repacking boxes,
crates and sacks on the Doctor's orders, when you came to call,
master.</p>

<p>'I would speak to you in private, madam,' you said to the
Doctor.</p>

<p>She looked at me. I stood there, hot and sweating, dotted with
little lengths of straw from the packing cases.</p>

<p>She said, 'I think Oelph can stay, don't you, Guard
Commander?'</p>

<p>You looked at her for a few moments, I recall, then your stern
expression melted like snow. 'Yes,' you said, and sat down with a
sigh in a chair which temporarily had no cases or their contents
balanced upon it. 'Yes, I dare say he can.' You smiled at the
Doctor. She was just in the act of tying a towel round her head,
having finished one of her baths. She always tied a towel round her
hair after her bath, and I remember thinking, stupidly, Why is she
doing that? She has no hair to dry. She wore a thick and voluminous
shift which made her denuded head look very small, until she tied
the towel round it. She picked a couple of boxes off a couch and
sat.</p>

<p>You took a moment to seat yourself just as you wanted, moving
your sword so that it was comfortable, placing your booted feet
just so. Then you said, 'I am told you have asked the King to
release you from your post.'</p>


<p>'That is correct, Guard Commander.'</p>


<p>You nodded for a moment. 'That is probably for the best.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm sure it is, Guard Commander. Oelph, don't just stand
there,' she said, turning to look at me. 'Continue with your work,
please.'</p>


<p>'Yes, mistress,' I mumbled.</p>


<p>'I would dearly love to know quite what happened in the chamber
that evening.'</p>


<p>'I am sure you already do, Guard Commander.'</p>


<p>'And I am equally sure I do not, madam,' you said, with a
resigned sigh in your voice. 'A more superstitious man would think
it must have been sorcery.'</p>


<p>'But you are not so deceived.'</p>


<p>'Indeed not. Ignorant, but not deceived. I think I can say that
if I had no other explanation I would be sorrier the longer the
matter went unexplained and you were still here, but as you say you
are going . . .'</p>

<p>'Yes. Back to Drezen. I have already inquired about a ship . . .
Oelph?'</p>

<p>I had let drop a flask of distilled water. It had not broken,
but the noise had been loud. 'Sorry, mistress,' I said, trying not
to burst out crying. A ship!</p>

<p>'Do you feel your time here has been a success, Doctor?'</p>

<p>'I think so. The King is in better health than when I arrived.
For that alone, if I can take any of the credit, I hope I may feel
. . . fulfilled.'</p>

<p>'Still, it will be good to get back amongst your own kind, I
imagine.'</p>


<p>'Yes, I'm sure you can imagine.'</p>


<p>'Well, I must be going,' you said, standing. Then you said, 'It
was strange, all those deaths at Yvenir, then good Duke Ormin, and
those three men.'</p>


<p>'Strange, sir?'</p>


<p>'So many knives, or blades, at any rate. And yet so few found.
The murder weapons, I mean.'</p>


<p>'Yes. Strange.'</p>


<p>You turned at the door. 'That was a bad business the other
night, in the questioning chamber.'</p>


<p>The Doctor said nothing.</p>


<p>'I'm glad you were delivered. . . unscathed. I would give a
great deal to know how it was accomplished, but I would not trade
the knowledge for the result.' You smiled. 'I dare say I will see
you again, Doctor, but if I do not, let me wish you a safe journey
back to your home.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And so, a half-moon later, I stood on the quayside with the
Doctor, hugging her and being hugged and knowing that I would do
anything to make her stay or be allowed to follow her, and also
that I would never see her again.</p>

<p>She pushed me gently away. 'Oelph,' she said, sniffing back her
tears. 'You will not forget that Doctor Hilbier is more formal in
his approach than I. I have respect for him but he&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mistress, I will not forget anything you have told me.'</p>

<p>'Good. Good. Here.' She reached into her jacket. She presented
me with a sealed envelope. 'I have arranged with the Mifeli clan
that you have an account with them. This is the authority. You may
use the earnings on what pleases you, though I hope you will do a
little experimentation of the type I taught you &mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mistress!'</p>

<p>'&mdash; but the capital, I have instructed the Mifelis, the capital
only becomes yours when you achieve the title of Doctor. I would
advise you to buy a house and premises, but&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mistress! An account? What? But what, where?' I said, genuinely
astonished. She had already left me what she thought might come in
useful to me &mdash; and what I might be able to store in a single room
in the house of my new mentor, Doctor Hilbier &mdash; from her supplies
of medicines and raw materials.</p>

<p>'It is the money the King gave me,' she said. 'I don't need it.
It is yours. Also, there is in the envelope the key to my journal.
It contains all the notes and the descriptions of my experiments.
Please use it as you see fit.'</p>

<p>'Oh, mistress!'</p>

<p>She took my hand in hers and squeezed. 'Be a good doctor, Oelph.
Be a good man. Now, quickly,' she said, with a desperately sad and
unconvincing laugh, 'to save our tears before we both become
hopelessly dehydrated, eh? Let us&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And if I became a doctor, mistress?' I asked, in a far more
collected and cold manner than I would have imagined I was capable
of at such a moment. 'If I became a doctor and used some of the
money to mirror your trip, and come to Drezen?'</p>

<p>She had started to turn away. She turned halfway back, and
looked at the wooden decking of the quay. 'No, Oelph. No, I . . . I
don't think I'll be there.' She looked up and smiled a brave smile.
'Goodbye, Oelph. Fare well.'</p>

<p>'Goodbye, mistress. Thank you.'</p>

<p>I will love you for ever.</p>

<p>I thought the words, and could have said them, might have said
them, perhaps nearly said them, but in the end did not say them. It
may be that that was the unsaid thing even I did not know I had
thought of saying that let me retain a shred of selfrespect.</p>

<p>She walked slowly up the first half of the steep-set gangplank,
then lifted her head, lengthened her stride, straightened her back
and strode up and on to the great galleon, her dark hat
disappearing somewhere beyond the black webbing of the ropes, all
without a backward glance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I walked slowly back up the city, my head down, my tears
dripping down my nose and my heart in my boots. Several times I
thought to look up and round, but each time I told myself the ship
would not have sailed yet. All the time I kept hoping, hoping,
hoping that I would hear the slap of running, booted feet, or the
doubled thud of a pursuing sedan chair, or the rattle of a hire
carriage and the snort of its team, and then her voice.</p>

<p>The cannon went for the bell, echoing round the city and causing
birds to flap and fly all over in wheeling dark flocks, crying and
calling, and still I did not look round because I judged that I was
in the wrong part of the city to see the harbour and the docks, and
then when I finally did look up and back I realised I had walked
too far up into the city and I was almost in Market Square. I could
not possibly see the galleon from here, not even its top-most
sails.</p>

<p>I ran back down the way I had come. I thought I might be too
late, but it was not too late, and by the time I could see the
docks again, there was the great vessel, all bulbous and stately
and moving towards the harbour entrance under the tow of two long
cutters full of men heaving on stout oars. There were still many
people on the dockside, waving at the passengers and crew gathered
near the stern of the departing galleon. I could not see the Doctor
on the ship.</p>

<p>I could not see her on the ship!</p>

<p>I ran around the dockside like a mad man, looking for her. I
searched each face, studied every expression, tried to analyse each
stance and gait, as though in my lovelorn lunacy I really believed
that she had indeed decided to quit the ship and stay here, stay
with me, this whole apparent departure just a maddeningly extended
joke, and yet, on relinquishing the ship, for a jest had decided to
disguise herself, just to taunt me further.</p>

<p>The galleon slipped out to sea almost without me noticing,
letting the cutters come creasing back across the waves while she,
beyond the harbour wall, let drop her creamy fields of sail and
took the wind about her.</p>

<p>After that, the people drifted away from the quay until there
were just a couple of sobbing women left, one standing clutched in
about herself, her face quite covered by her hands, the other
squatting, face raised to stare emptily at the skies while the
tears coursed down her cheeks in silence .</p>

<p>. . . And I, staring out at the gap between the harbour
light-towers towards the distant line that was the jagged far
circumference of Crater Lake. And there I stood, and wandered,
stunned and unsteady, shaking my head and muttering to myself, and
started to leave several times but could not, and so drifted back
towards the quayside, assailed by the treacherous sparkle of the
water that had let her slip away from me, buffeted by the wind that
was blowing her further on her journey with each beat of my heart
and hers, and attended by the caustic cries of wheeling sea birds
and the quiet and hopeless sobs of women.</p>

<h3 class="chapter">24. THE BODYGUARD</h3>

<p>The bodyguard DeWar woke from a dream of flying. He lay there a
moment in the darkness for the few moments it took him to come
fully awake, remembering where he was, who he was, what he was, and
what had been happening.</p>

<p>The weight of the knowledge of all that had gone so wrong so
recently settled on him like a dozen coats of chain mail thrown one
by one upon his bed. He even gave a little groan as he rolled over
in the narrow cot and lay with one arm under the back of his head,
staring up into the blackness.</p>

<p>The war in Ladenscion had been lost. It was as simple as that.
The barons had got all they had ever asked for, and more, by taking
it. The Dukes Simalg and Ralboute were on their way home with the
tattered and dispirited remains of their armies.</p>

<p>Lattens had edged a little closer to death, whatever was wrong
with him proof against every remedy the physicians could
devise.</p>

<p>UrLeyn had sat in on one war council, just yesterday, once the
full extent of the catastrophe in Ladenscion had revealed itself
through the jumble of reports and coded messages, but he had stared
down at the table surface throughout, uttering only monosyllables
mostly. He showed a little more animation and a spark of his old
self when he had roundly condemned Simalg and Ralboute for the
whole debacle, but even that tirade, towards the end, had seemed
lacklustre and forced, as though he could not maintain even his
anger.</p>

<p>It had been decided that there was little that could be done.
The armies would return and the wounded would have to be cared for.
A new hospital would be set up to this purpose. The army would be
reduced to the minimum necessary for the defence of Tassasen. There
had already been disturbances in the streets in a handful of cities
when people who had in the past only grumbled over the increased
taxes required for the war had rioted when they heard it had all
been for nothing. Taxes would have to come down to keep the
populace at peace and so a number of projects would have to be
suspended or abandoned. At some point negotiations with the
victorious barons would have to be entered into, to regularise
matters once the situation had stabilised.</p>

<p>UrLeyn nodded all this through, seemingly uninterested in it
all. The others could take care of it. He had left the council of
war to return to his son's bedside.</p>

<p>UrLeyn still would not let the servants into his apartments,
where he passed almost all his time. He spent a bell or two at
Lattens' side each day, and visited the harem only erratically,
often just talking with the older concubines and especially with
the lady Perrund.</p>

<p>DeWar felt a damp patch on his pillow, where his cheek had lain
during the night. He turned over on his side, absently touching the
fold in the head bolster which he must have dribbled on to during
the night. How undignified we become in our sleep, he thought,
rubbing the damp triangle of material between his fingers. Perhaps
he had been sucking it while he slept, he thought. Did one do that?
Did people do such a thing? Perhaps children&mdash;</p>

<p>He leaped out of bed, pulled on his hose, teetering one-legged
and cursing, fastened his sword belt across his waist and grabbed
his shirt as he kicked the door open and raced through the early
morning shadows of his small living room and out into the corridor,
where startled servants had been snuffing the candles. He ran
quickly, bare feet thudding on the wooden boards. He pulled his
shirt on as best he could.</p>

<p>He was looking for a guard, to tell him to follow him, but there
were none to be seen. Rounding a corner that would take him towards
Lattens' sick room, he crashed into a servant carrying a breakfast
tray, sending the girl and the tray tumbling across the floor. He
shouted back an apology.</p>

<p>There was a guard at Lattens' door, slumped asleep on a chair.
DeWar kicked the seat and shouted at the man as he burst through
the door.</p>

<p>The nurse looked up from the window where she had been sitting
reading. She looked with widened eyes at DeWar's bare chest
revealed by the half-tucked shirt.</p>

<p>Lattens lay still in his bed. A basin and a cloth lay on the
table by his head. The nurse seemed to shrink back a little as
DeWar strode across the room to the boy's bed. DeWar heard the
guard come in behind him. He turned his head briefly and said,
'Hold her,' and nodded at the nurse, who flinched. The guard moved
towards the woman, uncertain.</p>

<p>DeWar went to Lattens' side. He touched his neck and felt a weak
pulse. Clutched in the boy's fist was the pale yellow scrap of
material that was his comforter. DeWar prised it from his hand as
gently as he could, turning to watch the nurse as he did so. The
guard stood at her side, one hand clamped over her wrist.</p>

<p>The nurse's eyes went wide. Her free arm flailed at the guard,
who kept a hold of her and eventually succeeded in grabbing it and
bringing it under control. She tried to kick him but he twirled her
round and forced her arm up her back until she doubled over and
screamed, her face level with her knees.</p>

<p>DeWar inspected the sucked end of the comforter while the guard
looked on, mystified, and the woman gasped and wept. DeWar sucked
tentatively at the piece of material. There was a taste. It was
slightly sweet and a little acrid at the same time. He spat on the
floor, then knelt down on one knee so that he could look into the
nurse's reddened face. He held the comforter in front of the
woman.</p>

<p>'Is this how the boy's been poisoned, madam?' he asked
softly.</p>

<p>The woman stared cross-eyed at the scrap of material. Tears and
snot dribbled down her nose. Her jaw was clenching and unclenching.
After a few moments she nodded.</p>

<p>'Where is the solution?'</p>

<p>'Uh &mdash; under the window seat,' the nurse said, her voice
shaking.</p>

<p>'Hold her there,' DeWar told the guard quietly. He went to the
window and threw off the cushion in the seat set into the thickness
of the wall, pulled open a wooden flap and reached inside. He threw
aside toys and a few clothes until he found a small opaque jar. He
brought it over to the nurse.</p>

<p>'Is this it?'</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>'Where does it come from?'</p>

<p>She shook her head. He took out his long knife. She screamed,
then shook and struggled in the guard's grip until he tightened it
and she hung gasping again. DeWar put the knife very close to her
nose. 'The lady Perrund!' she screamed. 'The lady Perrund!'</p>

<p>DeWar froze. 'What?'</p>

<p>'The lady Perrund! She gives me the jars! I swear!'</p>

<p>'I am not convinced,' DeWar said. He nodded to the guard, who
forced the woman's arm further up her back. She shrieked in
pain.</p>

<p>'It's true! The truth! It's the truth!' she screamed.</p>

<p>DeWar sat back on his heel. He looked at the guard holding the
woman and shook his head once. The man relaxed his hold on the
nurse again. The woman sobbed, her whole doubled-up body shaking
with the effort. DeWar put the knife away and frowned. Another
couple of uniformed men came thundering into the room, swords
readied.</p>

<p>'Sir?' said one, taking in the scene.</p>

<p>DeWar stood. 'Guard the boy,' he told the pair who had just
entered. 'Take her to Guard Commander ZeSpiole,' he instructed the
man holding the nurse. 'Tell him Lattens has been poisoned and she
is the poisoner.'</p>

<p>DeWar tucked his shirt in as he strode quickly towards UrLeyn's
apartments. Another guard, also alerted to the commotion, came
running up to him. DeWar sent him off with the man taking the nurse
to ZeSpiole.</p>

<p>There was one guard at UrLeyn's door. DeWar drew himself up,
starting to wish he had taken the time to put on all his clothes.
He had to see UrLeyn no matter what orders he might have left, and
this guard's help might be needed to effect entry. He assumed what
he hoped was his most commanding tone. 'Straighten up there!' he
barked. The guard jerked upright. 'Is the Protector inside?' DeWar
demanded, scowling and nodding at the door.</p>

<p>'No, sir!' the guard shouted.</p>

<p>'Where is he?'</p>

<p>'Sir, he went to the harem, I think, sir! He said you need not
be informed, sir!'</p>

<p>DeWar looked at the closed door for a moment. He began to turn
and move away, then stopped. 'When did he go there?'</p>

<p>'About a half-bell ago, sir!'</p>

<p>DeWar nodded, then moved away. At the corner, he started
running. Two more guards joined him when he called them. They
headed for the harem.</p>

<p>The double doors to the three-domed receiving room slammed back
against the walls on either side. There were a couple of concubines
in the softly lit hall, talking to members of their families and
sharing a light breakfast with them. All fell silent when the doors
crashed open. The chief eunuch Stike sat like a sleepy white
mountain in his pulpit raised near the middle of the room. His face
cleared of sleep and his brows met and creased as the doors swung
slowly back from their twinned impact. DeWar sprinted across the
room towards the doors leading to the harem proper, the two guards
trailing in his wake.</p>

<p>'No!' bellowed the chief eunuch. He rose and started to wobble
down the steps.</p>

<p>DeWar reached the harem doors, wrenching at them. They were
locked. Stike came lurching over the floor towards him, wagging his
finger. 'No, Mr DeWar!' he cried. 'You do not go in there! Not
ever, in any event, but especially not when the Protector himself
is in there!'</p>

<p>DeWar looked at the two guards who had followed him. 'Hold him,'
he told them. Stike screamed as they tried to take hold of him. The
eunuch was surprisingly strong, and each of his leg-thick arms
knocked over the guards once each before they could secure him. He
cried out for help as DeWar tore at his white robes, looking for
and finding the set of keys he knew was there. He cut the keys from
the struggling giant's belt, tried one, then another, before the
third key slipped in and turned and the doors opened.</p>

<p>'No!' wailed Stike, almost pulling himself free from the two
guards. DeWar looked around quickly, but there was nobody else who
could help. He pulled the key out and took the full set with him as
he entered the inner harem. Behind him, the two guards struggled to
contain the mighty rage of the chief eunuch.</p>

<p>DeWar had never been here before. He had, however, looked at the
layout of the place on drawings, so knew where he was, even if he
did not know where UrLeyn was.</p>

<p>He ran down a short corridor to another set of doors, Stike's
anguished cries and entreaties still ringing in his ears. There was
a round internal courtyard beyond, gently lit by a single
translucent dome of plaster high above. The glowing space rose on
three colonnaded levels. A small fountain played in the centre and
couches and seats were scattered about its floor. Girls in various
states of dress and undress stood or doubled up where they lounged,
yelping and screaming when they saw DeWar. A eunuch leaving a room
off to one side of the lowest colonnaded level saw him and shouted.
He waved his arms and came running up to DeWar, slowing and
stopping only when he saw that DeWar held a sword.</p>

<p>'The lady Perrund,' DeWar said quickly. 'The Protector.'</p>

<p>The eunuch stared as though hypnotised at the tip of the sword,
for all that it was a couple of strides away from him. He raised
one shaking hand towards the pale dome above.</p>

<p>'They are in,' he said in a quiet, shaking whisper, 'the
top-most level, sir, in the small court.'</p>

<p>DeWar looked around and saw the stairs. He ran for them, then in
a spiral up them, to the top. There were ten or so doors arranged
all around the highest level, but across the well of the courtyard
he could see a wider entrance which formed a truncated corridor
with double doors at its end. He ran, breathing hard now, round the
gallery to the short hallway and the twinned doors. They were
locked. The second key he tried opened them.</p>

<p>He found himself in another domed internal courtyard. This one
had but a single level, and the columns supporting the roof and the
translucent plaster dome were of a more delicate turn than those in
the main court. There was a fountain and a pool in the centre of
this yard too, which at first sight appeared to be deserted. The
fountain was in the shape of three intertwined maidens, delicately
sculpted from pure white marble. DeWar sensed movement behind the
pale carvings of the fountain. Behind this, on the far side of the
court, beyond the columns, one door lay ajar.</p>

<p>The fountain splashed, tinkling. It was the only sound in the
wide, circular space. Shadows moved on the polished marble of the
floor, near the fountain. DeWar glanced behind him, then walked
forward and round.</p>

<p>The lady Perrund knelt before the fountain's raised pool,
washing her hands slowly and methodically. Her good hand massaged
and wiped at the wasted hand, which lay floating just under the
surface of the water like the limb of a drowned child.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a thin gown of red. It was semitransparent,
and the light from the glowing plaster dome above fell down across
her dishevelled blonde hair and picked out her shoulders, breasts
and hips within the gauzy material. She did not look up when DeWar
appeared round the side of the fountain. Instead she concentrated
on washing her hands, until she was satisfied. She lifted the
wasted limb out of the water and placed it gently by her side,
where it hung, limp and thin and pale. She rolled the flimsy red
sleeve down over it. Then she looked slowly round and up at DeWar,
who had approached to within a few steps, his face pale and
terrible and full of fear.</p>

<p>Still she did not say a word, but looked slowly round at the
door which lay open behind her, opposite the double doors through
which DeWar had entered.</p>

<p>DeWar moved quickly. He pushed the door open with the pommel of
his sword and looked into the room. He stood there for some time.
He backed away, until his shoulder hit one of the columns
supporting the roof of the room. The sword hung loose in his hand.
His head lowered until his chin rested on the white shirt over his
chest.</p>

<p>Perrund watched him for a moment, then turned away. Still
kneeling, she dried her hands as best she could on her thin gown,
looking at the rim of the fountain's bowl, a hand or so in front of
her eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly DeWar was at her side, standing by her wasted arm, his
bare feet by her calf. The sword came slowly down to rest on the
marble rim of the fountain's bowl, then slid with a grating noise
near to her nose. It dipped, and the blade went under her chin. The
metal was cold on her skin. A gentle pressure lifted her face until
she was looking up at him. The sword remained pressed against her
throat, cold and thin and sharp.</p>

<p>'Why?' he asked her. There were, she saw, tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>'Revenge, DeWar,' she said quietly. She had thought that if she
could speak at all, her voice would quiver and shake and quickly
break and leave her sobbing, but her voice was steady and
unstrained.</p>


<p>'For what?'</p>


<p>'For killing me, and my family, and for raping my mother and my
sisters.' She thought her own voice sounded much less affected than
DeWar's. She sounded reasonable, almost unconcerned, she
thought.</p>

<p>He stood looking down at her, his face wet with tears. His chest
was coming and going inside the loosely tucked and still unbuttoned
shirt. The sword at her throat, she noticed, did not move.</p>

<p>'The King's men,' he said, his voice catching. The tears
continued to stream.</p>

<p>She wanted to shake her head, though she was worried that the
slightest movement would cut her skin. But then he would be doing
that soon enough anyway, if she was lucky, she thought, and so,
tentatively, she did shake her head. The pressure of the sword
blade across her throat did not waver, but she avoided cutting
herself.</p>

<p>'No, DeWar. Not the King's men. His men. Him. His people. He and
his cronies, those closest to him.'</p>

<p>DeWar stared down at her. The tears were fewer now. They had
made a damp patch on the white shirt, below his chin.</p>

<p>'It was all as I have told you, DeWar, except that it was the
Protector and his friends, not one of the old nobles still loyal to
the King. UrLeyn killed me, DeWar. I thought I would return the
compliment.' She opened her eyes wide and let her gaze fall to the
blade of the sword in front of her. 'May I beg you to be quick, for
the friends we once were?'</p>

<p>'But you <em>saved</em> him!' DeWar shouted. Still the sword
barely moved.</p>

<p>'Those were my orders, DeWar.'</p>


<p>'Orders?' He sounded incredulous.</p>


<p>'When what had happened to my town and my family and to me had
happened, I wandered away. I found a camp, one night, and offered
myself to some soldiers, for food. They all took me too, and I did
not care, because I knew then that I had become dead. But one was cruel
and wanted me in a way I did not want to be taken, and I found that
once one was dead it was very easy indeed to kill. I think they
would have killed me in return for his death, and that would have
been that, and perhaps the better for all of us, but instead their
officer took me away. I was brought to a fortress over the border,
in Outer Haspidus, mostly manned by Quience's men but commanded by
forces loyal to the old King. I was treated kindly, and there I was
introduced to the art of being a spy and an assassin.' Perrund
smiled.</p>

<p>If she had been alive, she thought, her knees, on the cold white
marble tiles, would be hurting a little by now, but she was dead
and so they troubled somebody else. DeWar's face was still streaked
with tears. His eyes stared, seeming to bulge in their sockets.
'But I was ordered to bide my time, by King Quience himself,' she
told him. 'UrLeyn was to die, but not at the height of his fame and
power. I was commanded that I must do everything I could to keep
him alive until his utter ruin had been contrived.'</p>

<p>She gave a small, shy smile and moved her head fractionally to
look at her wasted arm. 'I did. And in the process I became above
suspicion.'</p>

<p>There was a look of utter horror on DeWar's face. It was, she
thought, like looking at the face of somebody who had died in agony
and despair.</p>

<p>She had not seen, or wanted to see, UrLeyn's face. She had
waited until, having been given the news she claimed to have been
called away to receive, he had fallen into a fit of sobbing and
buried his face in the pillow, then she had risen, lifted a heavy
jet vase in her one good hand and brought it crashing down on the
back of his skull. The sobbing had stopped. He had not moved again
or made a further sound. She'd slit his throat for good measure,
but she had done that while straddling his back, and still she had
not seen his face.</p>

<p>'Quience was behind it all,' DeWar said. His voice
sounded strangled, as though he had a sword at his throat, not
she at hers. 'The war, the poisoning.'</p>

<p>'I do not know, DeWar, but I imagine so.' She looked
deliberately down at the sword blade. 'DeWar.' She looked up into
his eyes with a hurt, pleading expression. 'There is no more I can
tell you. The poison was delivered by innocents to the Paupers'
Hospital, where I received it. Nobody I know knew what it was or
what it was for. If you have the nurse as well, you have the
totality of our conspiracy. There is no more to tell.' She paused.
'I am already dead, DeWar. Please, if you would, finish the job. I
am suddenly so weary.' She let the muscles supporting her head
relax so that her chin rested on the blade. It, and through it
DeWar, was now taking all the weight of her head and its
memories.</p>

<p>The metal, warm now, dropped slowly away from beneath her, so
that she had to stop herself falling forwards and striking the rim
of the fountain pool. She looked up. DeWar, his own head hanging
down, was sliding the sword back into its scabbard.</p>

<p>'I told him the boy was dead, DeWar!' she said angrily. 'I lied
to him before I crushed his filthy skull and slit his scrawny
old-man's throat!' She struggled to her feet, her joints
protesting. She went to DeWar and took his arm with her good hand.
'Would you leave me to the guard and the questioner? Is that your
judgment?'</p>

<p>She shook him, but he did not respond. She looked down, then
grabbed at the nearest weapon, his long knife. She pulled it from
its sheath. He looked alarmed and took two rapid steps backwards,
away from her, but he could have stopped her taking it, and he had
not.</p>

<p>'Then I'll do it myself!' she said, and brought the knife
quickly up to her throat. His arm was a blur. She saw sparks in
front of her face. Her hand began to sting almost before her eyes
and mind had registered what had happened. The knife he had knocked
from her hand smacked into a wall and fell with a metallic clatter
to the marble floor. The sword hung in his hand again.</p>

<p>'No,' he said, moving towards her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="chapter">EPILOGUE</h3>

<p>It strikes me, having written this, how little we can ever
know.</p>

<p>The future is by its very nature unfathomable. We can predict a
very little way into it indeed with any reliability, and the
further we attempt to see into what has not yet happened, the more
foolish we later realise we have been &mdash; with the benefit of
hindsight. Even the most obviously predictable events, which seem
the most likely to occur, can prove fickle. When the rocks fell
from the sky back when I was a child, did millions of people the
previous evening not believe that the suns would rise as usual, on
schedule, the following morning? And then the rocks and the fire
fell from the sky, and for whole countries the suns did not rise
that day, and indeed for many millions of people they would never
rise again.</p>

<p>The present is in some ways no more sure, for what do we really
know about what is happening now? Only what is happening
immediately around us. The horizon is the usual maximum extent of
our ability to appreciate the moment, and the horizon is far away,
so events there must be very large for us to be able to see them.
Besides, in our modern world the horizon is in reality not the edge
of the land or the sea, but the nearest hedge, or the inside of a
city wall or the wall of the room we inhabit. The greater events in
particular tend to happen somewhere else. The very instant that the
rocks and the fire fell from the sky, when over half the world woke
up to chaos, on the far side of the globe all was well, and it took
a moon or more before the sky darkened with unusual clouds.</p>

<p>When a king dies, the news might take a moon to travel to the
furthest corners of his kingdom. It might take years to travel to
countries on the far side of the ocean, and in some places, who
knows, it might slowly stop being news at all as it travels,
becoming instead recent history, and so barely worth the mentioning
when travellers exchange the latest developments, so that the death
that shook a country and unseated a dynasty only arrives centuries
later, as a short passage in a history book. So the present, I
repeat, is in some ways no more knowable than the future, for it
takes the passage of time for us to know what is happening at any
given moment.</p>


<p>The past, then? Surely there we can find certainty,
because once something has happened it cannot unhappen, it
cannot be said to change. There may be further discoveries which
throw a new light on what has happened, but the thing itself cannot
alter. It must stay fixed and sure and definite and therefore
introduce some certainty into our lives.</p>

<p>And yet how little historians agree. Read the account of a war
from one side and then from the other. Read the biography of a
great man written by one who has come to despise him, then read his
own account. Providence, talk to two servants about the same event
that same morning in the kitchen and you may well be told two quite
different tales, in which the wronged becomes the wrong-doer and
what seemed obvious from one telling seems suddenly quite
impossible given the other.</p>

<p>A friend will tell a story which involves the two of you in such
a way that you know it did not happen so at all, but the way he
tells it is more amusing than the reality, or reflects better on
the two of you, and so you say nothing, and soon others will tell
the story, altered again, and before long you may find yourself
telling it the way you know for a certainty it simply did not
happen.</p>

<p>Those of us who keep journals occasionally find we have, with no
malice or thought of tale or reputation enhancement whatsoever,
remembered something quite erroneously. We may for a goodly part of
our lives have been giving a perfectly plain account of some past
occurrence, one that we are quite sure of and seem to remember very
well indeed, only to come across our own written account of it,
recorded at the time, and find that it did not happen the way we
remembered it at all!</p>


<p>So we can never be sure of anything, perhaps.</p>


<p>And yet we must live. We must apply ourselves to the world. To
do so we have to recall the past, attempt to foresee the future and
cope with the demands of the present. And we struggle through,
somehow, even if in the process &mdash; perhaps just to retain what we
can of our sanity &mdash; we convince ourselves that the past, present
and future are much more knowable than they really are or can ever
be.</p>

<p>So, what happened?</p>

<p>I have spent the rest of a long life returning to the same few
instants, without reward.</p>

<p>I think there is not a day when I do not think back to those few
moments in the torture chamber of the palace of Efernze in the city
of Haspide.</p>

<p>I was not unconscious, I am sure of that. The Doctor only
convinced me that I was for a short while. Once she had gone, and I
had recovered from my grief, I became more and more certain that
precisely the amount of time which I thought had passed then, had
passed. Ralinge was on the iron bed, poised to take her. His
assistants were a few steps away, I cannot recall exactly where. I
closed my eyes to spare myself the awful moment, and then the air
filled with strange noises. A few moments &mdash; just a handful of
heartbeats at the most, on that I would stake my life &mdash; and there
they all were, the three of them, violently dead, and the Doctor
already released from her bonds.</p>

<p>How? What could possibly move with such speed to do such things?
Or, what trick of will or mind could be employed to make them do
such things to themselves? And how was she able to appear so serene
in the moments immediately thereafter? The more I think back to
that interlude between the deaths of the torturers and the arrival
of the guards, when we sat side by side in the small barred cell,
the more sure I become that she somehow knew that we would be
saved, that the King would suddenly find himself at death's door
and she would be summoned to save him. But how could she have been
so calmly certain?</p>

<p>Perhaps Adlain was right, and there was sorcery at work. Perhaps
the Doctor had an invisible bodyguard who could leave egg-sized
bumps on the heads of knaves and slip unnoticed behind us into the
dungeon to butcher the butchers and release the Doctor from her
manacles. It almost seems like the only rational answer, yet it is
the most fanciful of all.</p>

<p>Or perhaps I did sleep, swoon, or become unconscious or whatever
you like to call it. Perhaps my certainty is misplaced.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What more is there to tell? Let me see.</p>

<p>Duke Ulresile died, in hiding, in Brotechen province, a few
months after the Doctor left us. It was a simple cut from a broken
plate, they say, which led to blood poisoning. Duke Quettil died
soon afterwards, too, from a wasting disease which affected all the
extremities and turned them necrotic. Doctor Skelim was unable to
do anything.</p>


<p>I became a doctor.</p>


<p>King Quience ruled another forty years, in exceptionally good
health until the very end.</p>

<p>He left only daughters, so now we have a queen. I find this less
troubling than I would have thought.</p>

<p>Lately they have taken to calling the Queen's late father
Quience the Good, or sometimes Quience the Great. I dare say one or
other will have been settled on by the time anybody comes to read
this.</p>

<p>I was his personal physician for the last fifteen years, and the
Doctor's training and my own discoveries made me, by all accounts,
the best in the land. Perhaps, indeed, one of the best in the
world, for when, partly due to the ambassadorship of gaan Kuduhn,
more frequent and reliable links with the archipelagic republic of
Drezen were established, we discovered that while our antipodean
cousins rivalled and indeed even exceeded us in many ways, they
were not quite so advanced in medicine, or indeed anything else, as
the Doctor had implied.</p>

<p>Gaan Kuduhn came to live amongst us and became something of a
father to me. Later he became a good friend and spent a decade as
ambassador to Haspidus. A generous, resourceful and determined man,
he confessed to me once that there was only one thing he had ever
set his wits to that he had failed to accomplish, and that was
trying to track down the Doctor, or indeed hunt down exactly where
she had come from.</p>

<p>We could not ask her, for she disappeared.</p>

<p>One night in the sea of Osk, the <em>Plough of the Seas</em> was
running before the wind past a line of small, uninhabited islands,
bound for Cuskery. Then the glowing green apparition that mariners
call chain-fire began to play about the rigging of the ship. All
were at first amazed, but then they became in fear of their lives,
for not only was the chain-fire brighter and more intense than
anything the sailors could recall seeing in the past, but the wind
increased suddenly and threatened to tear the sails, bring down the
masts or even turn the great galleon over entirely.</p>

<p>The chain-fire disappeared as suddenly as it had arrived, and
the wind fell back to the strong and steady force it had been
before. By and by, all but those on watch returned to their cabins.
One of the other passengers remarked they had not been able to wake
the Doctor to come to see the display in the first place, though
nobody thought much of this &mdash; the Doctor had been invited to dine
with the vessel's captain that evening, but had sent a note
declining the invitation, citing an indisposition due to special
circumstances.</p>

<p>By the next morning it was realised she was gone. Her door was
locked from the inside and had to be forced. The scuttles were
screwed open for ventilation, but were too small for her to have
squeezed through. Apparently all her belongings, or at any rate the
great majority of them, were still there in the cabin. They were
packed up and were supposed to be sent on to Drezen, but
unsurprisingly they disappeared during the passage.</p>

<p>Gaan Kuduhn, hearing all this, like I, nearly a year later,
became fixed upon letting her family know what had happened to her
and what good she had done in Haspidus, but for all his enquiries
on the island of Napthilia and in the city of Pressel, including
some which he made himself on a visit there, and despite the
numerous occasions when he seemed on the very brink of discovering
her nearest ones, he was always frustrated, and never did find
anybody who had actually met or known the woman we knew as Doctor
Vosill. Still, I think that was one of the few things that irked
him on his death bed, and there was, in balance, an extraordinarily
influential and productive life to look back on.</p>

<p>The old Guard Commander Adlain suffered badly towards the end of
his allotment of seasons. I think what consumed him was something
like the growing disease that had taken the slaver Tunch, all those
years earlier.</p>

<p>I was able to alleviate the pain but in the end it became too
much for him. My old master told me, he swore truly, that indeed,
as I had always suspected, he had been the officer who had rescued
me from the wreck of my home and the dead arms of my parents in the
smoking ruins of the city of Derla, but that he had taken me to the
orphanage in a fit of guilt, for it had been he who had killed my
mother and father and burned their house. Now, he said, from the
clawing depths of his agony, I would want to kill him.</p>

<p>I chose not to believe him, but I did what I could to hasten his
end, which came, peacefully, less than a bell later. His mind must
have been going, of course, for if I had believed for a moment what
he had told me, I think I would have been tempted to have left him
to suffer.</p>

<p>Also before he died Adlain begged me, knowing he was on his
death bed, to tell him what had really happened in the torture
chamber that evening. He tried to joke that if Quience had not
turned the questioning chamber into a wine cellar shortly after the
Doctor left us, he might have been tempted to have me interrogated
there, just to discover the truth. I think he was joking. It
saddened me to have to tell him that I had already, in my reports
to him, told him everything that had occurred to the limit of my
recollection and descriptive ability.</p>

<p>I have no idea whether he believed me or not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And so I am old now, and will lie on my own death bed before a
few more years are out. The Kingdom is at peace, we prosper, and
there is even what the Doctor would, I think, have called Progress.
To me fell the immense privilege of being the first Principal of
the Medical University of Haspide. I also shouldered the happy duty
of being the third President of the Royal College of Physicians,
and later served as a city counsellor, when I was in charge of the
committee overseeing the construction of the King's Charitable
Hospital and the Infirmary For The Freed. I am proud that one of
such lowly birth was able to serve his King and his people in so
many different ways during a time of such improvement.</p>

<p>There are still wars, naturally, though not recently in the
vicinity of Haspidus. Even yet the three so-called Empires dispute,
though with little result save to leave the rest of the world free
from Imperial tyranny and so able to thrive in its own various
ways. Our navy seems to fight sea battles every now and again, but
as they are usually far away and we are as a rule victorious it is
as if they do not really count as warfare. Going further back, the
barons of Ladenscion had to be taught that who helps them resist
one ruler might take it ill when they attempt to forgo all rule.
There was civil war in Tassasen, of course, following the death of
the Regicide UrLeyn, and King YetAmidous proved a poor leader,
though young King Lattens (well, he is not so young any more, I
admit, but he still seems young to me) made good most of the ill,
and rules well, if quietly, to this day. I am told he is something
of a scholar, which is no bad thing in a king, providing it is not
taken to excess.</p>

<p>But that was a long time ago. All of this was.</p>

<p>The tale of the concubine Perrund, which forms the counterpoint
to my own, and which I have included here with almost no amendment
save where her taste foundered occasionally on the skerries of
overly ornate prose, I searched out myself, after reading a version
in the form of a play which I discovered in another bibliophile's
library here in Haspide.</p>

<p>I chose to end her tale where I did because it is after that
point that the two versions diverge most violently. The first
version I read, in the guise of a drama in three acts, had the
bodyguard DeWar running the lady through with his sword to revenge
his dead master and then returning to his home in the Half-Hidden
Kingdoms, where he was revealed in his true identity as a prince
who had been spurned by his father due to an unfortunate but
honourable misunderstanding. A death-bed reconciliation, decorated
with pretty speeches, was effected with the expiring King and DeWar
reigned well thereafter. I admit I find this the more morally
satisfying ending.</p>

<p>The version which purported to be by the lady's own hand and
which she claimed she only committed to paper to counter the
sensationalised untruths of the dramatic edition could hardly have
been more different. In it, the bodyguard whose trust she had just
violated and whose master she had most cruelly done to death, took
her by the hand (from which she had barely finished washing their
master's blood) and led her out o&pound; the harem. They told those
waiting nervously outside that UrLeyn was well, but sleeping
deeply, at last, as though he already knew the cause of the boy's
illness had been discovered.</p>

<p>DeWar said he would take the concubine Perrund to Guard
Commander ZeSpiole's offices to confront the nurse who had accused
her. Falsely, he suspected. DeWar apologised to chief eunuch Stike
and handed him back his keys. He told some of the assembled guards
to remain where they were and the rest to go back to their normal
posts and tasks. He led the lady Perrund away, politely but
firmly.</p>

<p>They were seen leaving the palace by the groom who supplied them
with mounts, and observed leaving the city by a variety of honest
citizens.</p>

<p>It was about the time they were galloping through the city's
northern gate that Stike tried to open the doors into the small
court, on the top-most level of the harem.</p>

<p>The key would not fit properly into the lock, in which something
appeared to be lodged.</p>

<p>The doors were broken down. The foreign body which had been
inserted into the lock after the doors had been secured proved to
be a piece of marble in the shape of a little finger, broken from
one of the maidens in the fountain in the centre of the raised pool
in the little court.</p>

<p>UrLeyn's body was discovered in the bedroom off the court. His
blood saturated the sheets. His body was quite cold.</p>

<p>DeWar and Perrund were never caught. They made their way after
unrecounted adventures to Mottelocci, in the Half-Hidden Kingdoms,
where DeWar, surprisingly, was not known at all, but which he knew
a great deal about, and where he rapidly established a good name
for himself.</p>

<p>The two became merchants, and later founded a bank. Perrund
wrote the account from which I have taken half my story. They
married, and their sons &mdash; and allegedly their daughters too &mdash;
continue to this day to run a trading enterprise that supposedly
rivals that of our own Mifeli clan. The company's symbol,
reportedly, is a simple torus, a ring, such as might be cut from
one end of a hollow pipe. (This symbol is one half of what I
suspect is not the only set of correspondences within and between
these two tales, but &mdash; considering the implications of these far
too bamboozling for this old head to encompass &mdash; I have left it to
the reader to discover their own points of similarity, draw their
own conclusions and blaze their own trails of speculation.)</p>

<p>At any rate, DeWar and Perrund, we are told, both died in the
mountains, in an avalanche in a mountain pass, five years ago. The
snow and ice of the unforgiving peaks is their only tomb, but as
they died after what appears to have been a long and happy life
together, I beg to repeat that I prefer the former version of their
fates, even if it is not supported by any facts whatsoever.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And now I think my divided tale is finished. I am sure there is
much I have not said, much that could justifiably have been added
had we &mdash; had I &mdash; only known a little extra, discovered a trifle
more, but, as I have indicated above, sometimes (indeed probably
always) one simply has to make do with what there is.</p>

<p>My wife is due to return soon from the market. (Yes, I married,
and I love her now as I always have, for her own sake, not for that
of my lost love, even if as I will admit she does look just a
little like the good Doctor.) She took two of our grandchildren
with her to look for presents, and they will expect me to play with
them when they come back. I do little real work now I am so old,
but still there is a life to be lived.</p>
