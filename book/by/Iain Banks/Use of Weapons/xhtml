<p>
'Tell me, what is happiness?'</p>
<p>
'Happiness? Happiness... is to wake up, on a bright spring morning,
after an exhausting first night spent with a beautiful...
passionate... multi-murderess.'</p>
<p>
'... Shit, is <I>that</I> all?'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
In his fingers, the glass lay like something trapped, sweating light.
The liquid it contained was the same colour as his eyes, and swilled
around lethargically in the sunlight under his heavy-lidded gaze, the
glinting surface of the drink throwing highlights onto his face like
veins of quick gold.</p>
<p>
He drained the glass, then studied it as the alcohol made its way
down his throat. His throat tingled, and it seemed to him that the
light tingled in his eyes. He turned the glass over in his hands,
moving it carefully and smoothly, seemingly fascinated by the
roughness of the ground areas and the silky slickness of the unetched
parts. He held it up to the sun, his eyes narrowing. The glass
sparkled like a hundred tiny rainbows, and minute twists of bubbles
in the slender stem glowed golden against the blue sky, spiralling
about each other in a fluted double helix.</p>
<p>
He lowered the glass, slowly, and his gaze fell upon the silent city.
He squinted out over the roofs and spires and towers, out over the
clumps of trees marking the sparse and dusty parks, and out over the
distant serrated line of the city walls to the pale plains and the
smoke-blue hills shimmering in the heat haze beyond, beneath a
cloudless sky.</p>
<p>
Without taking his eyes from the view, he suddenly jerked his arm,
throwing the glass over his shoulder, back into the cool hall, where
it vanished into the shadows and shattered.</p>
<p>
'You bastard,' said a voice, after a slight pause. The voice sounded
both muffled and slurred. 'I thought that was the heavy artillery. I
nearly crapped myself. You want to see the place covered with
shit?... Oh hell; I've bit the glass, too... mmm... I'm bleeding.'
There was another pause. 'You hear?' The muffled, slurred voice
increased a little in volume. 'I'm bleeding... You want to see the
floor covered with shit and pedigree blood?' There was a scraping,
tinkling sound, then silence, then, 'You bastard.'</p>
<p>
The young man on the balcony turned away from the view over the city
and walked back inside the hall, only a little unsteadily. The hall
was echoing and cool. The floor was mosaic, millennia old, veneered
over in more recent times with a transparent, scratch-proof covering
to protect the tiny ceramic fragments. In the centre of the hall
there was a massive, elaborately carved banqueting table, surrounded
by chairs. Around the walls were scattered smaller tables, more
chairs, low chests of drawers, and tall sideboards, all made from the
same dark, heavy wood.</p>
<p>
Some of the walls were painted with fading but still impressive
murals, mostly of battlefields; other walls, painted white, supported
huge mandalas of old weapons; hundreds of spears and knives, swords
and shields, pikes and maces, bolas and arrows all arranged in great
whorls of pitted blade like the shrapnel of impossibly symmetrical
explosions. Rusting firearms pointing importantly at each other
above blocked-off fireplaces.</p>
<p>
There were one or two dulled paintings and frayed tapestries on the
walls, but vacant spaces for many more. Tall triangular windows of
coloured glass threw wedges of light across the mosaic and the wood.
The white stone walls rose to red piers at the top, supporting huge
black beams of wood that closed over the length of the hall like a
giant tent of angular fingers.</p>
<p>
The young man kicked an antique chair the right way up and collapsed
into it. 'What pedigree blood?' he said. He rested one hand on the
surface of the great table, and put the other up to and over his
scalp, as if through thick long hair, though in fact his head was
shaved.</p>
<p>
'Eh?' said the voice. It appeared to come from somewhere beneath the
great table the young man sat beside.</p>
<p>
'What aristocratic connections have you ever had, you drunken old
bum?' The young man rubbed his eyes with clenched fists, then, with
his hands open, massaged the rest of his face.</p>
<p>
There was a lengthy pause.</p>
<p>
'Well, I was once bitten by a princess.'</p>
<p>
The young man looked up at the hammer-beamed ceiling and snorted.
'Insufficient evidence.'</p>
<p>
He got up and went out onto the balcony again. He took a pair of
binoculars from the balustrade and looked through them. He tutted,
swaying, then retreated to the windows, bracing himself against the
frame so that the view steadied. He fiddled with the focus, then
shook his head and put the binoculars back on the stonework and
crossed his arms, leaning against the wall and gazing out over the
city.</p>
<p>
Baked; brown roofs and rough gable ends, like crusts and ends of
bread; dust like flour.</p>
<p>
Then, in an instant, under the impact of remembrance, the shimmering
view before him turned grey and then dark, and he recalled other
citadels (the doomed tent city in the parade-ground below, as the
glass in the windows shook; the young girl - dead now - curled up in
a chair, in a tower in the Winter Palace). He shivered, despite the
heat, and shoved the memories away.</p>
<p>
'What about you?'</p>
<p>
The young man looked back into the hall. 'What?'</p>
<p>
'You ever had any, umm, connections, with our, ah... betters?'</p>
<p>
The young man looked suddenly serious. 'I once...' he began, then
hesitated. 'I once knew some-one who was... nearly a princess. And I
carried part of her inside me, for a time.'</p>
<p>
'Say again? You carried...'</p>
<p>
'Part of her inside me, for a time.'</p>
<p>
Pause. Then, politely: 'Wasn't that rather the wrong way round?'</p>
<p>
The young man shrugged. 'It was an odd sort of relationship.'</p>
<p>
He turned back to the city again, looking for smoke, or people, or
animals, or birds, or anything that moved, but the view might as well
have been painted on a backdrop. Only the air moved, shimmering the
view. He thought about how you could make a backdrop tremble just so
to produce the same effect, then abandoned the thought.</p>
<p>
'See anything?' rumbled the voice under the table.</p>
<p>
The young man said nothing, but rubbed his chest through the shirt
and open jacket. It was a general's jacket, though he wasn't a
general.</p>
<p>
He came away from the window again and took up a large pitcher that
stood on one of the low tables by the wall. He lifted the pitcher
above his head and carefully up-ended it, his eyes closed, his face
raised. There was no water in the pitcher, so nothing happened. The
young man sighed, gazed briefly at the painting of a sailing ship on
the side of the empty jug, and gently replaced it on the table,
exactly where it had been.</p>
<p>
He shook his head and turned away, striding up to one of the hall's
two giant fireplaces. He hauled himself up onto the broad
mantelpiece, where he stared intently at one of the ancient weapons
mounted on the wall; a huge wide-mouthed gun with an ornamental stock
and open firing mechanism. He started trying to prise the blunderbuss
away from the stonework, but it was too firmly attached. He gave up
after a while and jumped to the floor, staggering a little as he
landed.</p>
<p>
'See anything?' said the voice again, hopefully.</p>
<p>
The young man walked carefully from the fireplace towards one corner
of the hall, and a long, ornate sideboard. Its top was covered by a
profusion of bottles, as was a considerable area of the nearby floor.
He searched through the collection of mostly broken, mostly empty
bottles until he found one that was intact and full. When he found it
he sat carefully on the floor, broke the bottle open against the leg
of a nearby chair, and emptied into his mouth the half of the
bottle's contents that hadn't spilled over his clothes or splashed
across the mosaic. He coughed and spluttered, put the bottle down,
then kicked it away under the sideboard as he got up.</p>
<p>
He made his way towards another corner of the hall, and a tall pile
of clothes and guns. He picked up a gun, untangling it from a knot of
straps, sleeves and ammunition belts. He inspected the weapon, then
threw it down again. He swept several hundred small empty magazines
aside to get at another gun, but then discarded that one too. He
picked up two more, checked them and slung one round his shoulder
while placing the other on a rug-covered chest. He went on through
the weapons until he had three guns slung about him, and the chest
was nearly covered with various bits and pieces of hardware. He
swept the gear on the chest into a tough, oil-stained bag and dumped
that on the floor.</p>
<p>
'No,' he said.</p>
<p>
As he spoke, there was a deep rumble, unlocated and indeterminate,
something more in the ground than in the air. The voice under the
table muttered something.</p>
<p>
The young man walked over to the windows, setting the guns down on
the floor.</p>
<p>
He stood there a while, looking out.</p>
<p>
'Hey,' said the voice under the table. 'Help me up, will you? I'm
under the table.'</p>
<p>
'What're you doing under the table, Cullis?' said the young man,
kneeling to inspect the guns; tapping indicators, twisting dials,
altering settings and squinting down sights.</p>
<p>
'Oh, this and that; you know.'</p>
<p>
The young man smiled, and crossed to the table. He reached underneath
and with one arm dragged out a large, red-faced man who wore a
field-marshal's jacket a size too big for him, and who had very short
grey hair and only one real eye. The large man was helped up; he
stood carefully, then slowly brushed one or two bits of glass off the
jacket. He thanked the young man by slowly nodding his head.</p>
<p>
'What time is it, anyway?' he asked.</p>
<p>
'What? You're mumbling.'</p>
<p>
'Time. What time is it?'</p>
<p>
'It's day time.'</p>
<p>
'Ha.' The large man nodded wisely. 'Just as I thought.' Cullis
watched the young man go back to the window and the guns, then heaved
himself away from the great table; he arrived, eventually, at the
table holding the large water-pitcher which was decorated with a
painting of an old sailing ship.</p>
<p>
He lifted the pitcher up, swaying slightly, turned it upside down
over his head, blinked his eyes, wiped his face with his hands and
flapped the collar of his jacket.</p>
<p>
'Ah,' he said, 'that's better'.</p>
<p>
'You're drunk,' said the young man, without turning away from the
guns.</p>
<p>
The older man considered this.</p>
<p>
'You almost manage to make that sound like a criticism,' he replied,
with dignity, and the tapped his false eye and blinked over it a few
times. He turned as deliberately as possible and faced the far wall,
staring at a mural of a sea battle. He fixed on one particularly
large warship portrayed there and seemed to clench his jaw slightly.</p>
<p>
His head jerked back, there was a tiny cough and a whine that
terminated in a miniature explosion; three metres away from the
warship in the mural, a large floor-standing vase disintegrated in a
cloud of dust.</p>
<p>
The large grey-haired man shook his head sadly and tapped his false
eye again. 'Fair enough,' he said, 'Im drunk.'</p>
<p>
The young man stood up, holding the guns he had selected, and turned
to look at the older man. 'If you had two eyes you'd be seeing
double. Here; catch.'</p>
<p>
So saying, he threw a gun towards the older man, who stretched out
one hand to catch it at just the same time as the gun hit the wall
behind him and clattered to the floor.</p>
<p>
Cullis blinked. 'I think,' he said, 'I would like to go back under
the table.'</p>
<p>
The young man came over, picked up the gun, checked it again, and
handed it to the older man, wrapping his large arms around it for
him. Then he manoeuvred Cullis over to the pile of weapons and
clothes.</p>
<p>
The older man was taller than the young man, and his good eye and the
false eye - which was in fact a light micro-pistol - stared down at
the young man as he pulled a couple of ammunition belts from the
floor and slung them over the older man's shoulders. The young man
grimaced as Cullis looked at him; he reached up and turned the older
man's face away, then from a breast pocket in the too-big
field-marshal's jacket extracted what looked like - and was - an
armoured eye-patch. He fitted the strap carefully over the taller
man's grey, crew-cut head.</p>
<p>
'My god!' Cullis gasped, 'I've gone blind!'</p>
<p>
The young man reached up and adjusted the eye patch. 'Your pardon.
Wrong eye.'</p>
<p>
'That's better.' The older man drew himself up, taking a deep breath.
'Where are the bastards?' his voice was still slurred; it made you
want to clear your throat.</p>
<p>
'I can't see them. They're probably still outside. The shower
yesterday is keeping the dust down.' The young man put another gun
into Cullis' arms.</p>
<p>
'The bastards.'</p>
<p>
'Yes, Cullis.' A couple of ammunition boxes were added to the guns
cradled in the older man's arms.</p>
<p>
'The filthy bastards.'</p>
<p>
'That's right, Cullis.'</p>
<p>
'The... Hmm, you know, I could do with a drink.' Cullis swayed. He
looked down at the weapons cradled in his arms, apparently trying to
puzzle out how they had appeared there.</p>
<p>
The young man turned round to lift more guns from the pile, but
changed his mind when he heard a large clattering, breaking noise
behind him.</p>
<p>
'Shit,' Cullis muttered, from the floor.</p>
<p>
The young man went over to the bottle-strewn sideboard. He loaded up
with as many full bottles as he could find and returned to where
Cullis was snoring peacefully under a pile of guns, boxes, ammunition
belts and the dark-splintered remains of a formal banqueting chair.
He cleared the debris off the older man and undid a couple of buttons
on the too-large field-marshal's jacket, then stuffed the bottles
inside, between jacket and shirt.</p>
<p>
Cullis opened his eye and watched this for a moment. '<I>What</I>
time did you say it was?'</p>
<p>
He buttoned Cullis' jacket up halfway. 'Time to go, I think.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm. Fair enough. You know best, Zakalwe.' Cullis closed his eye
again.</p>
<p>
The young man Cullis had called Zakalwe walked quickly to one end of
the great table, which was covered by a comparatively clean blanket.
A large, impressive gun lay there; he picked it up and returned to
the large, unimpressive form snoring on the floor. He took the old
man by the collar and backed off towards the door at the end of the
hall, dragging Cullis with him. He stopped to pick up the oil-stained
bag full of weaponry he'd sorted out earlier, slinging that over one
shoulder.</p>
<p>
He'd dragged Cullis halfway to the door when the older man woke up,
and with his one good eye fixed him with an upside-down bleary stare.</p>
<p>
'Hey.'</p>
<p>
'What, Cullis?' he grunted, heaving him another couple of metres.</p>
<p>
Cullis looked round the quiet white hall as it slid past him. 'Still
think they'll bombard this place?'</p>
<p>
'Mm-hmm.'</p>
<p>
The grey-haired man shook his head. 'Na,' he said. He took a deep
breath. 'Na,' he repeated, shaking his head. 'Never.'</p>
<p>
'Cue incoming' the young man muttered, glancing around.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless the silence continued as they reached the doors and he
kicked them open. The stairs that led down to the rear entrance hall
and out into the courtyard were of brilliant green marble edged with
agate. He made his way down, armaments and bottles clinking, gun
bumping, dragging Cullis down step after step, the big man's heels
thumping and scraping as he went.</p>
<p>
The old man grunted with each step, and once mumbled. 'Not so damn
hard, woman.' The young man stopped at that point and looked at the
old man, who snored and dribbled saliva from the corner of his mouth.
The young man shook his head and continued.</p>
<p>
On the third landing he stopped for a drink, allowing Cullis to snore
on, then felt sufficiently fortified to continue the descent. He was
still licking his lips and had just grabbed Cullis' collar when there
came an increasing, deepening, whistling noise. He dropped to the
floor and hauled Cullis half on top of him.</p>
<p>
The explosion was close enough to crack the high windows and loosen
some plaster, which fell gracefully down through the triangular
wedges of sunlight and pattered delicately on the stairs.</p>
<p>
'Cullis!' He grabbed the other man's collar again and leapt backwards
down the stairs. 'Cullis!' he yelled, skidding round the landing,
almost falling. 'Cullis, you dozy old prick! Wake up!'</p>
<p>
Another falling howl split the air; the whole palace shuddered to
the detonation and a window blew in overhead; plaster and glass
showered down the stairwell. Half crouched and still pulling Cullis,
he staggered and cursed down another flight of stairs. 'CULLIS!' he
roared, tearing past empty alcoves and exquisitely rendered murals in
the pastoral style. 'Fuck your geriatric ass, Cullis; WAKE UP!'</p>
<p>
He skidded round another landing, the remaining bottles clanking
furiously and the big gun knocking chunks out of decorative panels.
The deepening whistle again; he dived as the stairs leapt up at him
and glass burst overhead; everything was white as the dust whirled.
He staggered to his feet and saw Cullis sitting upright, scattering
plaster shards from his chest and rubbing his good eye. Another
explosion, rumbling further away.</p>
<p>
Cullis looked miserable. He waved one hand through the dust. 'This
isn't fog and that wasn't thunder, right?'</p>
<p>
'Right,' he shouted, already leaping downstairs.</p>
<p>
Cullis coughed and staggered after him.</p>
<p>
More shells were arriving as he reached the courtyard. One burst to
his left as he emerged from the palace; he jumped into the half-track
and tried to start it. The shell blew the roof off the royal
apartments. Showers of slates and tiles hammered into the courtyard,
turning into little dusty clouds in their own tributary explosions.
He put one hand over his head and rummaged in the passenger's
footspace for a helmet. A large chunk of masonry bounced off the
engine cover of the open vehicle, leaving a sizeable dent and a cloud
of dust. 'Oh... shiiiiit,' he said, finally finding a helmet and
jamming it onto his head.</p>
<p>
'Filthy Ba...!' yelled Cullis, tripping over just before he reached
the half-track and tumbling into the dust. He swore, then dragged
himself into the machine. Another shell and another ploughed into the
apartments to their left.</p>
<p>
The clouds of dust kicked up by the bombardment were drifting across
the faces of the buildings; sunlight sheared a gigantic wedge through
the chaos of the courtyard, edging shadow with light.</p>
<p>
'I honestly thought they'd go for the parliament buildings,' Cullis
said mildly, gazing at the burning wreck of a truck on the far side
of the courtyard.</p>
<p>
'Well, they didn't!' He punched the starter again, shouting at it.</p>
<p>
'You were right,' Cullis sighed and looked puzzled. 'What was the bet
we had again?'</p>
<p>
'Who cares?' he roared, kicking somewhere beneath the dashboard. The
half-track's motor stumbled into life.</p>
<p>
Cullis shook flaked tile from his hair while his comrade strapped on
his own helmet and handed a second one to him. Cullis accepted it
with relief and began to fan his face with it, patting the area of
his chest over his heart as if in encouragement.</p>
<p>
Then he drew his hand away, staring in disbelief at the warm red
liquid on it.</p>
<p>
The engine died. Cullis heard the other man bellow abuse and slam the
starter again; the engine coughed and spluttered, to the
accompaniment of whistling shells.</p>
<p>
Cullis looked down to the seat beneath him as more explosions
thundered, far away in the dust. The half-track shuddered.</p>
<p>
The seat below Cullis was covered in red.</p>
<p>
'Medic!' he yelled.</p>
<p>
'<I>What</I>?'</p>
<p>
'Medic!' Cullis screamed over another explosion, holding his
red-stained hand out. 'Zakalwe! I'm hit!' His good eye was wide with
shock. His hand trembled.</p>
<p>
The young man looked exasperated and slapped Cullis' hand away.
'That's wine, you cretin!' He lunged forward, hauled a bottle out of
the older man's tunic and dropped it in his lap.</p>
<p>
Cullis looked down, surprised. 'Oh,' he said. 'Good.' He peered
inside his jacket and carefully extracted a few pieces of broken
glass. 'Wondered why it was fitting so well,' he mumbled.</p>
<p>
The engine caught suddenly, roaring like something made furious by
the shaking ground and the swirling dust. Explosions in the gardens
sent brown sprays of earth and pieces of shattered statuary over the
courtyard wall, landing spattering and chunking all around them.</p>
<p>
He wrestled with the gear-lever until the drive engaged and nearly
threw him and Cullis out of the half-track as it leapt forward, out
of the courtyard and into the dusty road beyond. Seconds later the
major part of the great hall collapsed under the combined zeroed-in
weight of a dozen or so heavy artillery pieces, and smashed down into
the courtyard, filling it and the surrounding area with splintered
wood and masonry and yet more tumbling clouds of dust.</p>
<p>
Cullis scratched his head and muttered into the helmet he had just
been sick into.</p>
<p>
'The bastards,' he said.</p>
<p>
'That's right, Cullis.'</p>
<p>
'The filthy bastards.'</p>
<p>
'Yes, Cullis.'</p>
<p>
The half-track turned a corner and roared away, towards the desert.</p>

<p>
She made her way through the turbine hall, surrounded by an
ever-changing ring of friends, admirers and animals - nebula to her
attractive focus - talking to her guests, giving instructions to her
staff, making suggestions and offering compliments to the many and
various entertainers. Music filled the echoing space above the
ancient, gleaming machines, sitting silently amongst the chattering
throng of gaily dressed party-goers. She bowed graciously and smiled
to a passing Admiral and twirled a delicate black flower in her hand,
putting the bloom to her nose to draw in its heady fragrance.</p>
<p>
Two of the hralzs at her feet leapt up, yelping, fore-paws attempting
to find purchase on the smooth lap of her formal gown, their
glistening snouts raised to the flower. She bent, tapping both
animals gently on the nose with the bloom, making them bounce down to
the floor again, sneezing and shaking their heads. The people around
her laughed. Stooping, gown belling, she rubbed her hands through the
pelt of one of the animals, shaking its big ears, then raised her
head to the major-domo as he approached, deferentially threading his
way through the crowd around her.</p>
<p>
'Yes, Maikril?' she said.</p>
<p>
'The System Times photographer,' the major-domo said quietly. He
straightened as she rose, until he was looking up at her, his chin
level with her bare shoulders.</p>
<p>
'Admitting defeat?' She grinned.</p>
<p>
'I believe so, ma'am. Requesting an audience.'</p>
<p>
She laughed. 'So well put. How many did we get this time?'</p>
<p>
The major-domo sidled a little closer, looking nervously at one of
the hralzs when it snarled at him. 'Thirty-two moving-picture cameras
ma'am; over a hundred still.'</p>
<p>
She brought her mouth conspiratorially close to the major-domo's ear
and said, 'Not counting the ones we found on our guests.'</p>
<p>
'Quite, Ma'am.'</p>
<p>
'I'll see... him? Her?'</p>
<p>
'Him, Ma'am.'</p>
<p>
'Him, later. Tell him ten minutes; remind me in twenty. West atrium.'
She glanced at the single platinum bracelet she wore. Recognising her
retinae, a tiny projector disguised as an emerald briefly displayed a
holo plan of the old power station in twin cones of light aimed
straight at her eyes.</p>
<p>
'Certainly, Ma'am,' Maikril said.</p>
<p>
She touched his arm and whispered, 'We're heading over to the
aboretum, all right?'</p>
<p>
The major-domo's head barely moved to indicate he had heard. She
turned regretfully to the people around her, her hands clasped as
though in pleading. 'I'm sorry. Will you all excuse me, just a
moment?' She put her head to one side, smiling.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Hi. Hello. Hi there. How are you.' They walked quickly through the
party, past the grey rainbows of drugstreams and the plashing pools
of the wine fountains. She led, skirts rustling, while the major-domo
struggled to keep up with her long-legged gait. She waved to those
who greeted her; government ministers and their shadows, foreign
dignitaries and attaches, media stars of all persuasions,
revolutionaries and Navy brass, the captains of industry and commerce
and their more extravagantly wealthy shareholders. The hralzs snapped
perfunctorily at the heels of the major-domo, their claws skittering
on the polished mica floor, all ungainly, then bounding forward when
they encountered one of the many priceless rugs scattered throughout
the turbine hall.</p>
<p>
At the steps to the aboretum, hidden from the main hall by the
easternmost dynamo housing, she paused, thanked the major-domo,
shooed the hralzs away, patted her perfect hair, smoothed her already
immaculately smooth gown and checked that the single white stone on
the black choker was centered, which it was. She started down the
steps towards the tall doors of the arboretum.</p>
<p>
One of the hralzs whined from the top of the steps, bouncing up and
down on its forelegs, eyes watering.</p>
<p>
She looked back, annoyed. 'Quiet, Bouncer! Away!'</p>
<p>
The animal lowered its head and snuffled off.</p>
<p>
She closed the double doors quietly behind her, taking <I>in</I> the
quiet extent of luxuriant foliage the arboretum presented.</p>
<p>
Outside the high crystal curve of the partial dome, the night was
black. Small sharp lights burned on tall masts inside the arboretum,
casting deep jagged shadows amongs the crowded plants. The air was
warm and smelled of earth and sap. She breathed deeply and walked
towards the far side of the enclosure.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Hello there.'</p>
<p>
The man turned quickly to find her standing behind him, leaning
against a light-mast, her arms crossed, a small smile on her lips and
in her eyes. Her hair was blue-black, like her eyes; her skin was
fawn and she looked slimmer than she did on newscasts, when for all
her height she could seem stocky. He was tall and very slim and
unfashionably pale, and most people would have thought his eyes were
too close together.</p>
<p>
He looked at the delicately patterned leaf he still held in one
fragile-looking hand, then let it go, smiling uncertainly, and
stepped out of the extravagantly flowered bush he'd been
investigating. He rubbed his hands, looked bashful. 'I'm sorry, I...'
he gestured nervously.</p>
<p>
'That's all right,' she said, reaching out. They clasped hands.
'You're Relstoch Sussepin, aren't you?'</p>
<p>
'Umm..., yes,' he said, obviously surprised. He was still holding her
hand. He realised this, and looked even more discomforted, quickly
letting go.</p>
<p>
'Diziet Sma.' She bowed her head a little, very slowly, letting her
shoulder-length hair swing, keeping her eyes on him.</p>
<p>
'Yes, I know, of course. Umm... pleased to meet you.'</p>
<p>
'Good,' she nodded. 'And I you. I've heard your work.'</p>
<p>
'Oh.' He looked boyishly pleased and clapped his hands in a gesture
he didn't seem to notice himself making. 'Oh. That's very...'</p>
<p>
'I didn't say that I liked it,' she said, the smile hovering only on
one side of her mouth now.</p>
<p>
'Ah.' Crestfallen.</p>
<p>
<I>So cruel. </I>'But I do like it, very much,' she said, and
suddenly she was communicating amused - even conspiratorial -
contrition through her expression.</p>
<p>
He laughed and she felt something relax inside her. This was going to
be all right.</p>
<p>
'I did wonder why I'd been invited,' he confessed, the deep-set eyes
somehow bright. 'Everybody here seems so...', he shrugged, '...
important. That's why I...', he waved awkwardly behind him at the
plant he'd been inspecting.</p>
<p>
'You don't think composers should be regarded as important?' she
asked, gently chiding.</p>
<p>
'Well... compared to all these politicians and Admirals and business
people... in terms of power, I mean... And I'm not even a very
well-known musician. I'd have thought Savntreig, or Khu, or...'</p>
<p>
'They've composed their careers very well, certainly,' she agreed.</p>
<p>
He paused for a moment, then gave a small laugh and looked down. His
hair was very fine, and glinted in the high mast light. It was her
turn to fall in with his laugh. Maybe she ought to mention the
commission now, rather than leaving it to their next meeting, when
she would reduce the numbers - even if they were distant numbers, at
the moment - to something a little more friendly... or even leaving
it to a private rendezvous, later still, once she was sure he had
been captivated.</p>
<p>
How long should she spin this out? He was what she wanted, but it
would mean so much more after a charged friendship; that long,
exquisite exchange of gradually more intimate confidences, the slow
accumulation of shared experiences, the languorous spiralling dance
of attraction, coming and going and coming and going, winding closer
and closer, until that laziness was sublimed in the engulfing heat of
requital.</p>
<p>
He looked her in the eyes, and said, 'You flatter me, Ms Sma.'</p>
<p>
She returned his gaze, raising her chin a little, acutely aware of
each nuance in her carefully translated body language. There was an
expression on his face she did not think so childish, now. His eyes
reminded her of the stone on her bracelet. She felt a little
light-headed, and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>
'Ahem.'</p>
<p>
She froze.</p>
<p>
The word had been pronounced from behind and to one side of her. She
saw Sussepin's gaze falter and shift.</p>
<p>
Sma kept her expression serene as she turned, then glared at the
grey-white casing of the drone as though attempting to melt holes in
it.</p>
<p>
'<I>What</I>?' she said, in a voice that might have etched steel.</p>
<p>
The drone was the size - and near enough the shape - of a small
suitcase. It floated in towards her face.</p>
<p>
'Trouble, toots,' it said, then moved briskly to one side, angling
its body so that it appeared to be contemplating the inky heights of
sky beyond the crystal semisphere.</p>
<p>
Sma looked down at the brick floor of the arboretum, her lips pursed.
She allowed herself the tiniest of shakes of the head.</p>
<p>
'Mr Sussepin,' she smiled, and spread her hands. This pains me,
but... will you...?'</p>
<p>
'Of course.' He was already moving, and went quickly past, nodding
once.</p>
<p>
'Perhaps we can talk later,' she said.</p>
<p>
He turned, still backing off. 'Yes; I'd... that would...' He seemed
to lose inspiration, and nodded nervously again, walking quickly to
the doors at the far end of the arboretum. He left without looking
back.</p>
<p>
Sma whirled round to the drone, which was now humming innocently and
apparently staring into the depths of a gaudily coloured flower, its
stubby snout half buried in the bloom. It noticed her and looked up.
She stood with legs apart, put one fist on her hip and said, '
&quot;<I>Toots</I>&quot;?'</p>
<p>
The drone's aura field flashed on; the mixture of purple regret and
gunmetal puzzlement looked distinctly unconvincing. 'I don't know,
Sma... just slipped out. Alliteration.'</p>
<p>
Sma kicked at a dead branch, fixed the drone with a glare and said,
'Well?'</p>
<p>
'You're not going to like this,' the drone said quietly, retreating a
little and going dark with sorrow.</p>
<p>
Sma hesitated. She looked away for a moment, shoulders suddenly
slumping. She sat down on one of the tree roots. The gown crumpled
around her. 'It's Zakalwe, isn't it?'</p>
<p>
The drone flashed rainbow in surprise; so quickly - she thought - it
might even have been genuine. 'Good grief,' it said. 'How...?'</p>
<p>
She waved the question away. 'I don't know. Tone of voice. Human
intuition... Just that time again. Life was getting to be too much
fun.' She closed her eyes and rested her head against the rough dark
trunk of the tree. 'So?'</p>
<p>
The drone Skaffen-Amtiskaw lowered itself to the same height as the
woman's shoulder and floated near her. She looked at it.</p>
<p>
'We need him back again,' it told her.</p>
<p>
'I sort of thought so,' Sma sighed, flicking away an insect which had
just landed on her shoulder.</p>
<p>
'Well, yes. I'm afraid nothing else will work; it has to be him
personally.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah, but does it have to be <I>me</I> personally?'</p>
<p>
'That's... the consensus.'</p>
<p>
'Wonderful,' Sma said sourly.</p>
<p>
'You want the rest?'</p>
<p>
'Does it get any better?'</p>
<p>
'Not really.'</p>
<p>
'Hell,' Sma clapped her hands on her lap and rubbed them up and down.
'Might as well have it all at once.'</p>
<p>
'You would have to leave tomorrow.'</p>
<p>
'Aw drone, come on!' She buried her head in her hands. She looked up.
The drone was fiddling with a twig. 'You're kidding.'</p>
<p>
''Fraid not.'</p>
<p>
'What about all this?' She waved towards the turbine hall doors.
'What about the peace conference? What about all the froth out there
with their greased-up palms and their beady eyes? What about three
years work? What about an entire fucking planet...?'</p>
<p>
'The conference will go ahead.'</p>
<p>
'Oh sure, but what about this &quot;pivotal role&quot; I was supposed
to be playing?'</p>
<p>
'Ah,' said the drone, bringing the twig right up to the sensing band
on the front of its casing, 'well...'</p>
<p>
'Oh no.'</p>
<p>
'Look, I know you don't like...'</p>
<p>
'No, drone; it's not...' Sma got up suddenly and went to the edge of
the crystal wall, looking out into the night.</p>
<p>
'Dizzy...', the drone said, drifting closer.</p>
<p>
'Don't you &quot;Dizzy&quot; me.'</p>
<p>
'Sma... it isn't real. It's a stand-in; electronic, mechanical,
electro-chemical, chemical; a machine; a Mind-controlled machine, not
alive in itself. Not a clone or...'</p>
<p>
'I know what it is, drone,' she said, clasping her hands behind her.</p>
<p>
The drone floated closer to her, putting its fields to her shoulders,
squeezing gently. She shook its grip off, looked down.</p>
<p>
'We need your permission, Diziet.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah, I know that, too.' She looked up for stars that were twice
hidden, by cloud and by the lights of the arboretum.</p>
<p>
'You can, of course, stay here if you want to.' The drone's voice was
heavy, remorseful. 'The peace conference is certainly important; it
needs... somebody to smooth things through. No doubt about that.'</p>
<p>
'And what's so goddamn crucial I have to high-tail it tomorrow?'</p>
<p>
'Remember Voerenhutz?'</p>
<p>
'I remember Voerenhutz,' she said, voice flat.</p>
<p>
'Well, the peace lasted forty years, but it's breaking down now.
Zakalwe worked with a man called...'</p>
<p>
'Maitchigh?' she frowned, half turning her head to the drone.</p>
<p>
'Beychae. Tsoldrin Beychae. He became president of the cluster
following our involvement. While he was in power he held the
political system together, but he retired eight years ago, long
before he had to, to pursue a life of study and contemplation.' The
drone made a sighing noise. 'Things have slipped back since, and at
the moment Beychae lives on a planet whose leaders are subtly hostile
to the forces Zakalwe and Beychae represented and we backed, and who
are taking a leading part in the factionalising of the group. There
are several small conflicts under way and many more brewing;
full-scale war involving the entire cluster is, as they say,
imminent.'</p>
<p>
'And Zakalwe?'</p>
<p>
'Basically, it's an Out. Down to the planet, convince Beychae he's
needed, and at the very least get him to declare an interest. But it
may mean a physical spring, and the added complication is Beychae may
require a lot of convincing.'</p>
<p>
Sma thought it through, still regarding the night. 'No tricks we can
play?'</p>
<p>
'The two men know each other too well for anything other than the
real Zakalwe to work... likewise Tsoldrin Beychae and the political
machine throughout the entire system. Too many memories involved
altogether.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah,' Sma said quietly. 'Too many memories.' She rubbed her bare
shoulders, as though she was cold. 'What about big guns?'</p>
<p>
'We've a nebula fleet assembling; a core of one Limited System
Vehicle and three General Contact Units stationed around the cluster
itself, plus eighty or so GCUs keeping their tracks within a month's
rush-in distance. There ought to be four or five GSVs within a
two-to-three-months dash for the next year or so. But that's very,
very much a last resort.'</p>
<p>
'Megadeath figures looking a bit equivocal are they?' Sma sounded
bitter.</p>
<p>
'If you want to put it that way,' Skaffen Amtiskaw said.</p>
<p>
'Oh goddamn,' Sma said quietly, closing her eyes. 'So; how far away
is Voerenhutz? I've forgotten.'</p>
<p>
'Only about forty days, but we have to pick Zakalwe up first; say...
ninety for the whole outward journey.'</p>
<p>
She turned around. 'Who's going to control the stand-in if the ship's
taking me?' Her gaze flicked skyward.</p>
<p>
'The <I>Just Testing</I> will remain here in any event,' the drone
said. 'The very fast picket <I>Xenophobe</I> has been put at your
disposal. It can uplift tomorrow, a little after noon, earliest...
should you wish.'</p>
<p>
Sma stood still for a moment, feet together and arms crossed, her
lips pursed and face pinched. Skaffen-Amtiskaw introspected for a
moment, and decided it felt sorry for her.</p>
<p>
The woman was immobile and silent for a few seconds; then, abruptly,
she was striding towards the turbine hall doors, heels clattering on
the brick pathway.</p>
<p>
The drone swooped after her, falling in at her shoulder. 'What I
wish,' Sma said, 'is that you had a better sense of timing.'</p>
<p>
'I'm sorry. Did I interrupt something?'</p>
<p>
'Not at all. And what the hell's a &quot;very fast picket&quot;
anyway?'</p>
<p>
'New name for a (Demilitarised) Rapid Offensive Unit,' the drone
said.</p>
<p>
She glanced at it. It wobbled, shrugging.</p>
<p>
'It's supposed to sound better.'</p>
<p>
'And it's called the <I>Xenophobe.</I> Well that's just fine. Can the
stand-in pick up immediately?'</p>
<p>
'Noon tomorrow; can you de-brief up to...?'</p>
<p>
'Tomorrow morning.' Sma said, as the drone flicked round in front of
her and sucked the tall doors open; she strode through and leapt up
the steps into the turbine hall, skirts gathered in front her her.
The hralzs came skidding round the corner from the hall and gathered
yelping and bouncing around her. Sma stopped, while they milled
around her, sniffing her hems and trying to lick her hands.</p>
<p>
'No,' she told the drone. 'On second thoughts, scan me tonight, when
I tell you. I'll get rid of this lot early if I can. I'm going to
find Ambassador Onitnert now, have Maikril tell Chuzleis she's to get
the minister over to the bar at turbine one in ten minutes. Make my
apologies to the System Times hacks, have them taken back to the city
and released; give them a bottle of nightflor each. Cancel the
photographer, give him one still camera and let him take...
sixty-four snaps, strictly full permission required. Have one of the
male staff find Relstoch Sussepin and invite him to my apartments in
two hours. Oh, and-'</p>
<p>
Sma broke off suddenly and went down on her haunches to cradle the
long snout of one of the whimpering hralzs in her hands. 'Gainly,
Gainly, I know, I know,' she said, as the big-bellied animal keened
and licked at her face. 'I wanted to be here to see your babies born,
but I can't...' she sighed, hugged the beast, then held its chin in
one hand. 'What am I to do, Gainly? I could have you put to sleep
until I come back, and you'd never know... but all your friends would
miss you.'</p>
<p>
'Have them all put to sleep,' the drone suggested.</p>
<p>
Sma shook her head. 'You take care of them till I get back,' she told
the other hralz. 'All right?' She kissed the animal's nose and got
up. Gainly sneezed.</p>
<p>
'Two other things, drone,' Sma said, walking through the excited
pack.</p>
<p>
'What?'</p>
<p>
'Don't call me &quot;Toots&quot; again, all right?'</p>
<p>
'All right. What else?'</p>
<p>
They rounded the gleaming bulk of the long-stilled number six
turbine, and Sma stopped for a moment, surveying the busy crowd in
front of her, taking a deep breath and straightening her shoulders.
She was already smiling as she started forward and said quietly to
the drone, 'I don't want the stand-in screwing anybody.'</p>
<p>
'Okay,' the drone said as they went towards the partying people. 'It
is, after all, in a sense, your body.'</p>
<p>
'That's just it, drone,' Sma said, nodding to a waiter, who scurried
forward, drinks tray proffered. 'It <I>isn't</I> my body.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Aircraft and ground vehicles floated and wound away from the old
power station. The important people had departed. There were a few
stragglers left in the hall, but they didn't need her. She felt
weary, and glanded a little <I>snap </I>to lift the mood.</p>
<p>
From the south balcony of the apartments fashioned from the station's
admin block, she looked down to the deep valley and the line of tail
lights strung out along Riverside Drive. An aircraft whistled
overhead, banking and disappearing over the tall curved lip of the
old dam. She watched the plane go, then turned towards the penthouse
doors, taking off the small formal jacket and slinging it over her
shoulder.</p>
<p>
Music was playing, deep inside the sumptuous suite beneath the roof
garden. She headed instead for the study, where Skaffen-Amtiskaw was
waiting.</p>
<p>
The scan to update the stand-in took only a couple of minutes. She
came round with the usual feeling of dislocation, but it passed
quickly enough. She kicked off her shoes and padded through the soft
dark corridors towards the music.</p>
<p>
Relstoch Sussepin drew himself out of the seat he'd been occupying,
still holding a softly glowing glass of nightflor. Sma stopped in the
doorway.</p>
<p>
'Thank you for staying,' she said, dropping the little jacket onto a
couch.</p>
<p>
'That's all right.' He brought the glass of glowing drink towards his
lips, then seemed to think the better of it, and cradled it in both
hands instead. 'What, ah... was there anything, in particular
you...?'</p>
<p>
Sma smiled, somehow sadly, and put both hands on the wings of a big
revolving chair, which she stood behind. She looked down at the hide
cushion. 'Perhaps, now, I'm flattering myself,' she said. 'But, not
to put too fine a point on it...' She looked up at him. 'Would you
like to fuck?'</p>
<p>
Relstoch Sussepin stood stock still. After a while he raised the
glass to his lips and took a long slow drink, then brought the glass
slowly back down again. 'Yes,' he said. 'Yes, I wanted to...
instantly.'</p>
<p>
'There's only tonight,' she said, holding up one hand. 'Just tonight.
It's difficult to explain, but from tomorrow onwards... for maybe
half a year or more, I'm going to be incredibly busy;
two-places-at-once sort of busy, you know?'</p>
<p>
He shrugged. 'Sure. Anything you say.'</p>
<p>
Sma relaxed then, and a smile grew gradually on her face. She pushed
the big chair round and slid the bracelet from her wrist to let it
fall into the seat. Then she gently unbuttoned the top of her gown,
and stood there.</p>
<p>
Sussepin drained his glass, placed it on a shelf, and walked towards
her.</p>
<p>
'Lights,' she whispered.</p>
<p>
The lights slowly dimmed, right down, until eventually the softly
glowing dregs of the finished drink made the glass on the shelf the
brightest thing in the room.</p>

<p>
'Wake up.'</p>
<p>
He woke up.</p>
<p>
Dark. He straightened, beneath the covers, wondering who had talked
to him like that. Nobody talked to him in that tone, not any more;
even half asleep, coming unexpectedly awake in what must be the
middle of the night, he heard something in that tone he hadn't heard
for two, maybe three decades. Impertinence. Lack of respect.</p>
<p>
He brought his head out of the sheltering cover, into the warm air of
the room, and looked round in the one-light gloom, to see who had
dared address him like that. An instant of fear - had somebody got
past the guards and security screens? - was replaced by a furious
hunger to see who had the effrontery to speak like that to him.</p>
<p>
The intruder sat in a chair just beyond the end of the bed. He looked
odd in a way which was itself odd; a very new sort of unusualness,
unplaceable, even alien. He gave the impression of being a slightly
skewed projection. The clothes looked strange too; baggy, brightly
coloured, even in the dim light of the bedside lamp. The man was
dressed like a clown or a jester, but his somehow too symmetrical
face looked... grim? Contemptuous? That... <I>foreignness</I> made it
difficult to tell.</p>
<p>
He started to grope for his glasses, but it was just sleep in his
eyes. The surgeons had given him new eyes five years ago, but sixty
years of short-sightedness had left him with an ingrained reaction to
reach for glasses which were not there, whenever he first woke up. A
small price to pay, he had always thought, and now, with the new
retro-ageing treatment... The sleep cleared from his eyes. He sat up,
looking at the man in the chair, and began to think he was having a
dream, or seeing a ghost.</p>
<p>
The man looked young; he had a broad, tanned face and black hair tied
back behind his head, but thoughts of spirits and the dead came into
his head not because of that. It was something about the dark,
pit-like eyes, and the alien set of that face.</p>
<p>
'Good evening, Ethnarch.' The young man's voice was slow and
measured. It sounded, somehow, like the voice of someone much older;
old enough to make the Ethnarch feel suddenly young in comparison. It
chilled him. He looked around the room. Who was this man? How had he
got in here? The palace was meant to be impregnable. There were
guards everywhere. What was going on? The fear came back.</p>
<p>
The girl from the previous evening lay still on the far side of the
wide bed, just a lump under the covers. A couple of dormant screens
on the wall to the Ethnarch's left reflected the bedside light's weak
glow.</p>
<p>
He was frightened, but fully awake now and thinking quickly. There
was a gun concealed in the bed's headboard; the man at the end of the
bed didn't seem to be armed (but then why was he here?). But the gun
represented a desperate last resort. The voice code was the thing.
The mikes and cameras in the room were on standby, their automatic
circuits waiting for a specific sentence to activate them; sometimes
he wanted privacy in here, other times he wanted to record something
only for himself, and of course he'd always known there was a
possibility that somebody unauthorised might get in here, no matter
how tight the security was.</p>
<p>
He cleared his throat. 'Well well, this is a surprise.' His voice was
even, he sounded calm.</p>
<p>
He smiled thinly, pleased with himself. His heart - the heart of an
athletic young anarchist woman up until eleven years ago - was
beating quickly, but not worryingly so. He nodded. 'This <I>is</I> a
surprise,' he repeated. There; it was done. An alarm would already be
ringing in the basement control room; the guards would come piling
through the door in a few seconds. Or they might not risk that, and
instead release the ceiling gas cylinders, blasting them both into
unconsciousness in a blinding fog. There was a danger that would
rupture his eardrums (he thought, swallowing), but he could always
take a new pair from a healthy dissident. Maybe he wouldn't even have
to do that; the rumour was that the retro-ageing might include the
possibility of body-parts regrowing. Well, nothing wrong with
strength in depth; back-ups. He liked the feeling of security that
gave one. 'Well, well,' he heard himself say, just in case the
circuits hadn't picked up the code first or second time round, 'this
is indeed a surprise.' The guards should be here any second...</p>
<p>
The brightly dressed young man smiled. He flexed oddly, and leant
forward until his elbows rested on the top of the bed's ornate
footboard. His lips moved, to produce what might have been a smile.
He reached into one pocket of the baggy pantaloons and produced a
small black gun. He pointed it straight at the Ethnarch and said.
'Your code won't work, Ethnarch Kerian. There won't be any more
surprises that you're expecting and I'm not. The basement security
centre is as dead as everything else.'</p>
<p>
The Ethnarch Kerian stared at the little gun. He'd seen water pistols
that looked more impressive. <I>What is going on? Can he really have
come to kill me</I>? The man certainly didn't dress like an assassin,
and surely any serious assassin would just have killed him in his
sleep. The longer this fellow sat here, talking, the more danger he
was in, whether he had knocked out the links to the security centre
or not. So he might be mad, but he probably wasn't an assassin. It
was simply ludicrous that a real, professional assassin would behave
like this, and only an extremely able and completely professional
assassin could have penetrated the palace security... Thus, the
Ethnarch Kerian tried to convince his suddenly wildly beating,
mutinous heart. Where <I>were </I>the damn guards? He thought again
about the gun hidden in the ornamental headboard behind him.</p>
<p>
The young man folded his arms, so that the little gun was no longer
pointing at the Ethnarch. 'Mind if I tell you a little story?'</p>
<p>
<I>He must be mad. </I>'No; no; why don't you tell me a story?' the
Ethnarch said, in his most friendly and avuncular voice. 'What's your
name, by the way; you appear to have the advantage over me.'</p>
<p>
'Yes, I do, don't I?' the old voice from the young lips said.
'Actually there are two stories, but you know most of one of them.
I'll tell them at the same time; see if you can tell which is which.'</p>
<p>
'I-'</p>
<p>
'Ssh,' the man said, putting the little gun to his lips. The Ethnarch
half glanced at the girl on the other side of the bed. He realised he
and the intruder had been talking in quite low tones. Maybe if he
could get the girl to wake, she might draw his fire, or at least
distract him while he grabbed for the gun in the headboard; he was
faster than he had been for twenty years, thanks to the new
treatment... <I>where the hell were those guards</I> ?</p>
<p>
'Now look here, young man!' he roared. 'I just want to know what you
think you're doing here! Eh?'</p>
<p>
His voice - a voice that had filled halls and squares, without
amplification - echoed through the room. Dammit, the guards in the
basement security centre ought to be able to hear it without any
microphones. The girl on the other side of the bed didn't even stir.</p>
<p>
The young man was smirking. 'They're all asleep, Ethnarch. There's
just you and me. Now; this story...'</p>
<p>
'What...' the Ethnarch Kerian gulped, drawing his legs up under the
covers. 'What <I>are</I> you here for?'</p>
<p>
The intruder looked mildly surprised. 'Oh, I'm here to take you out,
Ethnarch. You are going to be removed. Now...' he laid the gun on the
broad top of the bed footboard. The Ethnarch stared at it. It was too
far away for him to grab, but...</p>
<p>
'The story,' the intruder said, settling back in the chair. 'Once
upon a time, over the gravity well and far away, there was a magical
land where they had no kings, no laws, no money and no property, but
where everybody lived like a prince, was very well-behaved and lacked
for nothing. And these people lived in peace, but they were bored,
because paradise can get that way after a time, and so they started
to carry out missions of good works; charitable visits upon the less
well-off, you might say; and they always tried to bring with them the
thing that they saw as the most precious gift of all; knowledge;
information; and as wide a spread of that information as possible,
because these people were strange, in that they despised rank, and
hated kings... and all things hierarchic... even Ethnarchs.' The
young man smiled thinly. So did the Ethnarch. He wiped his brow and
shifted back a little in the bed, as though getting more comfortable.
Heart still pounding.</p>
<p>
'Well, for a time, a terrible force threatened to take away their
good works, but they resisted it, and they won, and came out of the
conflict stronger then before, and if they had not been so
unconcerned with power for its own sake, they would have been
terribly feared, but as it was they were only slightly feared, just
as a matter of course given the scale of their power. And one of the
ways it amused them to wield that power was to interfere in societies
they thought might benefit from the experience, and one of the most
efficient ways of doing that in a lot of societies is to get to the
people at the top.</p>
<p>
'Many of their people become physicians to great leaders, and with
medicines and treatments that seem like magic to the comparatively
primitive people they're dealing with, ensure that a great and good
leader has a better chance of surviving. That's the way they prefer
to work; offering life, you see, rather than dealing death. You might
call them soft, because they're very reluctant to kill, and they
might agree with you, but they're soft the way the ocean is soft,
and, well; ask any sea captain how harmless and puny the ocean can
be.'</p>
<p>
'Yes, I see,' the Ethnarch said, sitting back a little further
shifting a pillow into place behind his back, and checking just where
he was in relation to the section of headboard that concealed the
gun. His heart was thrashing in his chest.</p>
<p>
'Another thing they do, these people, another way they deal in life
rather than death, is they offer leaders of certain societies below
a certain technological level the one thing all the wealth and power
those leaders command cannot buy them; a cure for death. A return to
youth.'</p>
<p>
The Ethnarch stared at the young man, suddenly more intrigued than
terrified. Did he mean the retro-ageing?</p>
<p>
'Ah; it's starting to click into place now, isn't it?' the young man
smiled. 'Well, you're right. Just that process that you've been going
through, Ethnarch Kerian. Which you've been paying for, this last
year. Which you did - if you remember - promise to pay for with more
than just platinum. <I>Do</I> you remember, hmmm?'</p>
<p>
'I... I'm not sure.' The Ethnarch Kerian stalled. He could see the
panel in the headboard where the gun was from the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>
'You promised to stop the killings in Youricam, remember?'</p>
<p>
'I may have said I'd review our segregation and resettlement policy
in the -'</p>
<p>
'No,' the young man waved his hand, 'I mean the killings, Ethnarch;
the death trains, remember? The trains where the exhaust comes out of
the rear carriage, eventually.' The young man made a sort of sneer
with his mouth, shook his head. 'Trigger any memories, that? No?'</p>
<p>
'I have no idea what you're talking about,' the Ethnarch said. His
palms were sweating, cold and slick. He rubbed them on the
bedclothes; the gun mustn't slip, if he got to it. The intruder's gun
was still lying on the bed's footboard.</p>
<p>
'Oh, I think you do. In fact, I know you do.'</p>
<p>
'If there have been any excesses by any members of the security
forces, they will be thoroughly -'</p>
<p>
'This isn't a press conference, Ethnarch.' The man tipped slightly
back in his seat, away from the gun on the footboard. The Ethnarch
tensed, quivering.</p>
<p>
'The point is, you made a deal and then didn't stick to it. And I'm
here to collect on the penalty clause. You were warned, Ethnarch.
That which is given can also be taken away.' The intruder tipped
further back in his seat, glanced round the dark suite, and nodded at
the Ethnarch, while putting his hands clasped behind his head. 'Say
goodbye to all this, Ethnarch Kerian. You're -'</p>
<p>
The Ethnarch turned, banged the hidden panel with his elbow, and the
section of headboard flicked round; he tore the gun from its clips
and swung it at the man, finding the trigger and pulling.</p>
<p>
Nothing happened. The young man was watching him, hands still behind
his neck, body rocking slowly back and forward in the chair.</p>
<p>
The Ethnarch clicked the trigger a few more times.</p>
<p>
'Works better with these,' the man said, reaching into a shirt
pocket, and throwing a dozen bullets onto the bed at the Ethnarch's
feet.</p>
<p>
The gleaming bullets snicked at they rolled and gathered in a fold in
the bedclothes. The Ethnarch Kerian stared at them.</p>
<p>
'... I'll give you anything,' he said, over a thick and dry tongue.
He sensed his bowels start to relax, and squeezed desperately,
feeling suddenly like a child again, as though the retro-ageing had
taken him even further back. 'Anything. Anything. I can give you more
than you ever dreamed of; I can -'</p>
<p>
'Not interested in that,' the man said, shaking his head. 'The story
isn't finished yet. You see, these people; these nice kind people who
are so soft and prefer to deal in life... when somebody goes back on
a deal with them, even when somebody kills after they've said they
wouldn't, they still don't like to kill in return. They'd rather use
their magic and their precious compassion to do the next best thing.
And so people disappear.' The man sat forward again, leaning on the
footboard. The Ethnarch stared, shaking, at him.</p>
<p>
'They - these nice people - they disappear bad people,' the young man
said. 'And they employ people to come and collect these bad men and
take them away. And these people - these collectors - they like to
put the fear of death into their collectees, and they tend to
dress...' he gestured at his own colour-fully motley clothes, '...
casually; and of course - thanks to the magic - they never have any
problems getting into even the most heavily guarded palace.'</p>
<p>
The Ethnarch swallowed, and with one furiously shaking hand, finally
put down the useless gun he was holding.</p>
<p>
'Wait,' he said, trying to control his voice. His sweat soaked the
sheets. 'Are you saying -'</p>
<p>
'We're nearly at the end of the story,' the young man interrupted.
'These nice people - who you would call soft, like I say - they
remove the bad people, and they take them away. They put them
somewhere they can't do any harm. Not a paradise, but not somewhere
that feels like a prison, either. And these bad people, they might
have to listen sometimes to the nice people telling them how bad
they've been, and they never again get the chance to change
histories, but they live a comfortable, safe life, and they die
peacefully... thanks to the nice people.</p>
<p>
'And though some would say the nice people are too soft, the soft,
nice people would say that the crimes committed by the bad people are
usually so terrible there is no known way of making the bad people
start to suffer even a millionth of the agony and despair they have
produced, so what is the point in retribution? It would be just
another obscenity to cap the tyrant's life with his own death.' The
young man looked briefly troubled, then shrugged. 'Like I say; some
people would say they're too soft.' He took the little gun from he
footboard and put it into a pocket of his pantaloons.</p>
<p>
The man stood slowly. The Ethnarch's heart still pounded, but in his
eyes there were tears. The young man leant down, picked up some
clothes and threw them at the Ethnarch, who grabbed at them, held
them to his chest.</p>
<p>
'My offer stands,' the Ethnarch Kerian said. 'I can give you -'</p>
<p>
'Job satisfaction,' the young man sighed, staring at one set of
fingernails. 'That's all you can give me, Ethnarch. I'm not
interested in anything else. Get dressed; you're leaving.'</p>
<p>
The Ethnarch started to pull on his shirt. 'Are you sure? I believe I
have invented some new vices even the old Empire didn't know about.
I'd be willing to share them with you.'</p>
<p>
'No, thank you.'</p>
<p>
'Who are these people you're talking about, anyway?' The Ethnarch
fastened his buttons. 'And may I yet know your name?'</p>
<p>
'Just get dressed.'</p>
<p>
'Well, I still think we can come to some sort of arrangement...' The
Ethnarch secured his collar. 'And this is all really quite
ridiculous, but I suppose I ought to be thankful you're not an
assassin, eh?'</p>
<p>
The young man smiled, seemed to pick something from a fingernail. He
put his hands in the pantaloon pockets as the Ethnarch kicked the
bedclothes down and picked up his britches.</p>
<p>
'Yes,' the young man said. 'Must be rather awful, thinking you're
about to die.'</p>
<p>
'Not the most pleasant experience,' agreed the Ethnarch, putting one
leg, then another, into his trousers.</p>
<p>
'But such a relief, I imagine, when you get the reprieve.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm.' The Ethnarch gave a small laugh.</p>
<p>
'A bit like being rounded up in a village and thinking you're going
to be shot...' the young man mused, facing the Ethnarch from the foot
of the bed. '... and then being told your fate is nothing worse than
resettlement.' He smiled. The Ethnarch hesitated.</p>
<p>
'Resettled; by train,' the man said, taking the little black gun out
of his pocket. 'By a train which contains your family; your street;
your village...'</p>
<p>
The young man adjusted something on the small black gun. '... And
then ends up containing nothing but engine fumes, and lots of dead
people.' He smiled, thinly. 'What do you think, Ethnarch Kerian?
Something like that?'</p>
<p>
The Ethnarch stopped moving, staring wide-eyed at the gun.</p>
<p>
'The nice people are called the Culture,' the young man explained,
'And I always did think they were too soft.' He stretched his arm
out, holding the gun. 'I stopped working for them some time ago. I'm
freelance now.'</p>
<p>
The Ethnarch looked, speechless, into the dark, ancient eyes above
the barrel of the black gun.</p>
<p>
'I,' said the man, 'am called Cheradenine Zakalwe.' He levelled the
gun at the Ethnnarch's nose. 'You are called dead.'</p>
<p>
He fired the gun... The Ethnarch had put his head back and started to
scream; so the single shot pierced the roof of his mouth before it
exploded inside his skull.</p>
<p>
Brain's splattered over the ornate headboard. The body thumped into
the skin-soft bedclothes and twitched once, spreading blood.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He watched the blood as it pooled. He blinked, a couple of times.</p>
<p>
Then, moving slowly, he peeled off the gaudy clothes. He put them in
a small black rucksack. Underneath, the one-piece suit was
shadow-dark.</p>
<p>
He took the matt-black mask from the rucksack and put it round his
neck, though not yet over his face. He moved to the head of the bed
and peeled a little transparent patch from the neck of the sleeping
girl, then went back into the dark depths of the room, slipping the
mask over his face as he did so.</p>
<p>
Using the nightsight, he undipped the panel over the security systems
control unit, and carefully removed several small boxes. Then,
walking very softly and slowly now, he crossed to the wall-sized
pornographic painting which concealed the door to the Ethnarch's
emergency escape route to the sewers and the palace roof.</p>
<p>
He turned back, before he slowly closed the door, and looked at the
bloody mess on the curved carved surface of the headboard. He smiled
his thin smile, a little uncertainly.</p>
<p>
Then he slipped away into the stone-black depths of the palace, like
a piece of the night.</p>

<p>
The dam lay wedged between the tree-studded hills like a fragment
from some enormous shattered cup. The morning sunshine shone up the
valley, hit the concave grey face of the dam, and produced a white
reflecting flood of light. Behind the dam, the long diminished lake
was dark and cold. The water came less than halfway up the massive
concrete bulwark, and the forests beyond had long since reclaimed
over half the slopes the dam's rising water had once drowned.
Sail-boats lay tethered to jetties strung along one side of the lake,
the chopping waters slapping at their glistening hulls.</p>
<p>
High overhead, birds carved the air, circling in the warmth of the
sunlight above the shadow of the dam. One of the birds dipped and
swooped, gliding down towards the lip of the dam and the deserted
roadway which ran along its curved summit. The bird pulled its wings
in just as it seemed it was about to collide with the white railings
which ran on either side of the road; it flashed between the
dew-sparkled stanchions, executed a half roll, partially opened its
wings again, and plummeted towards the obsolete power station that
had become the grandly eccentric - not to mention pointedly symbolic
- home of the woman called Diziet Sma.</p>
<p>
The bird settled belly-down to the swoop, and, level with the roof
garden, flung out its wings, grasping at the air and fluttering to a
precipitous halt, talons tacketing down on a window ledge set in the
highest storey of the old admin block apartments.</p>
<p>
Wings folded, soot-dark head to one side, one beady eye reflecting
the concrete light, the bird hopped forward to a slid-open window,
where soft red curtains rippled out into the breeze. It stuck its
head under the fluttering hem of the material and peered into the
darkened room beyond.</p>
<p>
'You missed it.' Sma said with quiet scorn, happening to pad past the
window just at that moment. She sipped from a glass of water she
held. Droplets from her shower beaded her tawny body.</p>
<p>
The bird's head swivelled, following her as she crossed to the closet
and commenced to dress. Swivelling back, the bird's gaze shifted to
the male body lying in the air a little less than a metre above the
floor-mounted bed-base. Inside the dim haze of the bed's AG field,
the pale figure of Relstoch Sussepin stirred, and rolled over in
mid-air. His arms floated out to either side, until the weak
centering field on his side of the bed brought them slowly back in
towards his body again. In the dressing room, Sma gargled with some
water, then swallowed it.</p>
<p>
Fifty metres east, Skaffen-Amtiskaw floated high in the air above the
floor of the turbine hall, surveying the wreckage of the party. The
section of the drone's mind that was controlling the guard-drone
disguised as a bird took a last look at the filigree of scratches on
Sussepin's buttocks, and the already fading bite-marks on Sma's
shoulders (as she covered them with a gauzy shirt), and then released
the guard-drone from its control.</p>
<p>
The bird squawked, jumped back from the curtain, and fell fluttering
and frenzied off the ledge, before opening its wings and beating back
up past the gleaming face of the dam, its shrill alarm-cries echoing
back from the concrete slopes and disturbing it further. Sma heard
the distant feedback of commotion as she buttoned her waistcoat, and
smiled.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Good night's sleep?' Skaffen-Amtiskaw inquired as it met her at the
portico of the old admin block.</p>
<p>
'Good night, no sleep,' Sma yawned, shooing the whining hralzs back
into the building's marble hall, where Maikril the major-domo stood
unhappily with a bunch of leads. She stepped out into the sunlight,
pulling on gloves. The drone held the car door open for her. She
filled her lungs with the fresh morning air and ran down the steps,
boot heels clattering. She jumped into the car, winced a little as
she settled in the driver's seat, then flicked a switch that started
the roof folding back, while the drone loaded her luggage into the
trunk. She tapped the battery gauges on the vehicle's dash and
blipped the accelerator, just to feel the wheel motors strain against
the brakes. The drone secured the trunk and floated into the rear
seats. She waved to Maikril, who was chasing one of the hralzs along
the steps outside the turbine hall, and didn't notice. Sma laughed,
stood on the throttle and slipped the brakes.</p>
<p>
The car leapt off in a spray of gravel, took the right-hander beneath
the trees with centimetres to spare, shot out through the station's
granite gates with a farewell shimmy of its rear end, and accelerated
hard down Riverside Drive.</p>
<p>
'We could have flown,' the drone pointed out, over the rush of air.</p>
<p>
But it suspected Sma wasn't listening.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The semantics of fortification were pan-cultural, she thought, as she
descended the stone steps from the curtain wall of the castle, gazing
up at the drum-shaped keep, hazy in the distance on its hill behind
several more layers of walls. She walked across the grass,
Skaffen-Amtiskaw at her shoulder, and exited the fort through a
postern.</p>
<p>
The view led down to the new port and the straits, where seaships
passed smoothly in the late morning sunlight, heading for ocean or
inland sea, according to their lanes. From the other side of the
castle complex, the city revealed its presence with a distant rumble
and - because the light wind came from that direction - the smell
of... well, she just thought of it as City, after three years here.
She supposed all cities smelled different, though.</p>
<p>
Diziet Sma sat on the grass with her legs drawn up to her chin, and
looked out across the straits and their arching suspension bridges to
the sub-continent on the far shore.</p>
<p>
'Anything else?' the drone asked.</p>
<p>
'Yeah; take my name off the judging panel for the Academy show... and
send a stalling letter to that Petrain guy.' She frowned in the
sunlight, shading her eyes. 'Can't think of anything else.'</p>
<p>
The drone moved in front of her, teasing a small flower from the
grass in front of her and playing with it. '<I>Xenophobe</I>'s just
entered the system,' it told her.</p>
<p>
'Well happy day,' Sma said sourly. She wetted one finger and rubbed a
little speck of dirt from the toe of one boot.</p>
<p>
'And that young man in your bed just surfaced; asking Maikril where
you've got to.'</p>
<p>
Sma said nothing, though her shoulders shook once and she smiled. She
lay back on the grass, one arm behind her.</p>
<p>
The sky was aquamarine, stroked with clouds. She could smell the
grass, and taste the scent of small, crushed flowers. She looked back
up over her forehead at the grey-black wall towering behind her, and
wondered if the castle had ever been attacked on days like this. Did
the sky seem so limitless, the waters of the straits so fresh and
clean, the flowers so bright and fragrant, when men fought and
screamed, hacked and staggered and fell and watched their blood mat
the grass?</p>
<p>
Mists and dusk, rain and lowering cloud seemed the better background;
clothes to cover the shame of battle.</p>
<p>
She stretched, suddenly tired, and shivered with a little flashback
of the night's exertions. And, like somebody holding something
precious, and it slipping from their fingers, but them having the
speed and the skill to catch it again before it hit the floor, she
was able - somewhere inside herself - to dip down and retrieve the
vanishing memory as it slipped back into the clutter and noise of her
mind, and glanding <I>recall</I> she held it, savoured it,
re-experienced it, until she felt herself shiver again in the
sunlight, and came close to making a little moaning noise.</p>
<p>
She let the memory escape, and coughed and sat up, glancing to see if
the drone had noticed. It was nearby, collecting tiny flowers.</p>
<p>
A party of what she guessed were schoolchildren came chattering and
squealing up the path from the metro station, heading towards the
postern. Heading and tailing the noisy column were adults, possessed
of that air of calmly tired wariness she'd seen before in teachers
and mothers with many children. Some of the kids pointed at the
floating drone as they passed, wide-eyed and giggling and asking
questions, before they were ushered through the narrow gate, voices
disappearing.</p>
<p>
It was, she'd noticed, always the children who made a fuss like that.
Adults just assumed that there was some trick behind the apparently
unsupported body of the machine, but children wanted to know how it
worked. One or two scientists and engineers had looked startled,
too, but she guessed a stereotype of unworldiness meant nobody
believed them that there must be something odd going on. Anti gravity
was what was going on, and the drone in this society was like a
flashlight in the stone age, but - to her surprise - it was almost
disappointingly easy just to brazen it out.</p>
<p>
'The ships just met up,' the drone informed her. 'They're
transferring the stand-in for real, rather than displacing it.'</p>
<p>
Sma laughed, plucked a blade of grass and sucked on it. 'Old <I>JT</I>
really doesn't trust its displacer, does it?'</p>
<p>
'I think the thing's senile, myself,' the drone said sniffily. It was
carefully slicing holes in the barely more than hair-thin stems of
the flowers it had picked, then threading the stems through each
other, creating a little chain.</p>
<p>
Sma watched the machine, its unseen fields manipulating the little
blossoms as dexterously as any lace-maker flicking a pattern into
existence.</p>
<p>
It was not always so refined.</p>
<p>
Once, maybe twenty years ago, far away on another planet in another
part of the galaxy altogether, on the floor of a dry sea forever
scoured by howling winds, beneath the mesa that had been islands on
the dust that had been silt, she had lodged in a small frontier town
at the limit of the railways' reach, preparatory to hiring mounts to
venture into the deep desert and search out the new child messiah.</p>
<p>
At dusk, the riders came into the square, to take her from the inn;
they'd heard her strangely coloured skin alone would fetch a handsome
price.</p>
<p>
The inn-keeper made the mistake of trying to reason with the men, and
was pinned to his own door with a sword; his daughters wept over him
before they were dragged away.</p>
<p>
Sma turned, sickened, from the window, heard boots thunder on the
rickety stairs. Skaffen-Amtiskaw was near the door. It looked,
unhurried at her. Screams came from the square outside and from
elsewhere inside the inn. Somebody battered at the door of her room,
loosing dust and shaking the floor. Sma was wide eyed, bereft of
stratagems.</p>
<p>
She stared at the drone. 'Do something,' she gulped.</p>
<p>
'My pleasure,' murmured Skaffen-Amtiskaw.</p>
<p>
The door burst open, slamming against the mud wall. Sma flinched. The
two black-cloaked men filled the doorway. She could smell them. One
strode in towards her, sword out, rope in the other hand, not
noticing the drone at one side.</p>
<p>
'Excuse me,' said Skaffen-Amtiskaw.</p>
<p>
The man glanced at the machine, without breaking stride.</p>
<p>
Then he wasn't there any more, and dust filled the room, and Sma's
ears were ringing, and pieces of mud and paper were falling from the
ceiling and fluttering through the air, and there was a large hole
straight through the wall into the next room, across from where
Skaffen-Amtiskaw - seemingly defying the law concerning
action/reaction - hovered in exactly the same place as before. A
woman shrieked hysterically in the room through the hole, where what
was left of the man was embedded in the wall above her bed, his blood
spattered copiously over ceiling, floor, walls, bed and her.</p>
<p>
The second man whirled into the room, discharging a long gun
point-blank at the drone; the bullet became a flat coin of metal a
centimetre in front of the machine's snout, and clunked to the floor.
The man unsheathed and swung his sword in one flashing movement,
scything at the drone through the dust and smoke. The blade broke
cleanly on a bump of red-coloured field just above the machine's
casing, then the man was lifted off his feet.</p>
<p>
Sma was crouched down in one corner, dust in her mouth and hands at
her ears, listening to herself scream.</p>
<p>
The man thrashed wildly in the centre of the room for a second, then
he was a blur through the air above her, there was another colossal
pulse of sound, and a ragged aperture appeared in the wall over her
head, beside the window looking out to the square. The floorboards
jumped and dust choked her. 'Stop!' she screamed. The wall above the
hole cracked and the ceiling creaked and bowed down, releasing lumps
of mud and straw. Dust clogged her mouth and nose and she struggled
to her feet, almost throwing herself out of the window in her
desperate attempt to find air. 'Stop,' she croaked, coughing dust.</p>
<p>
The drone floated smoothly to her side, wafting dust away from Sma's
face with a field-plane, and supporting the sagging ceiling with a
slender column. Both field components were shaded deep red, the
colour of drone pleasure. 'There, there,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said to
her, patting her back, Sma choked and spluttered from the window and
stared horrified at the square below.</p>
<p>
The body of the second man lay like a sodden red sack under a cloud
of dust in the midst of the riders. While they were still staring,
before most of the raiders could raise their swords, and before the
inn-keeper's daughters - being lashed to two of the mounts by their
captors - realised what the almost unrecognisable lump on the ground
in front of them was and started screaming again, something thrummed
past Sma's shoulder and darted down towards the men.</p>
<p>
One of the warriors roared, brandishing his sword and lunging towards
the door of the inn.</p>
<p>
He managed two steps. He was still roaring when the knife missile
flicked past him, field outstretched.</p>
<p>
It separated his neck from his shoulders. The roar turned to a sound
like the wind, bubbling thickly through the exposed wind-pipe as his
body crashed to the dust.</p>
<p>
Faster - and turning more tightly - than any bird or insect, the
knife missile made an almost invisibly quick circle round most of the
riders, producing an odd stuttering noise.</p>
<p>
Seven of the riders - five standing, two still mounted - collapsed
into the dust, in fourteen separate pieces. Sma tried to scream at
the drone, to make the missile stop, but she was still choking, and
now starting to retch. The drone patted her back. 'There, there,' it
said, concernedly. In the square, both of the inn-keeper's daughters
slipped to the ground from the mounts they had been tied to, their
bonds slashed in the same cut that had killed all seven men. The
drone gave a little shudder of satisfaction.</p>
<p>
One man dropped his sword and started to run. The knife missile
plunged straight through him. It curved like red light shining on a
hook, and slashed across the necks of the last two dismounted riders,
felling both. The mount of the final rider was rearing up in front of
the missile, its fangs bared, forelegs lashing, claws exposed. The
device went through its neck and straight into the face of its rider.</p>
<p>
On emerging from the resulting detonation, the machine slammed to a
stop in mid-air, while the rider's headless body slid off his
collapsing, thrashing animal. The knife missile spun slowly about,
seemingly reviewing its few seconds' work, then it started to float
back towards the window.</p>
<p>
The inn-keeper's daughters had fainted.</p>
<p>
Sma vomited.</p>
<p>
The frenzied mounts leapt and screamed and ran about the courtyard, a
couple of them dragging bits of their riders with them.</p>
<p>
The knife missile swooped and butted one of the hysterical mounts on
the head, just as the animal was about to trample the two girls lying
still in the dust, then the tiny machine dragged them both out of the
carnage, towards the doorway where their father's body lay.</p>
<p>
Finally, the sleek, spotless little device rose gently to the window
- daintily avoiding Sma's projected bile - and snicked back into the
drone's casing.</p>
<p>
'Bastard!' Sma tried to punch the drone, then kick it, then picked up
a small chair and smashed it against the drone's body. 'Bastard! You
fucking murderous <I>bastard</I>!'</p>
<p>
'Sma,' the drone said reasonably, not moving in the slowly settling
maelstrom of dust, and still holding the ceiling up. 'You said do
something.'</p>
<p>
'Meatfucker!' She smashed a table across its back.</p>
<p>
'Ms Sma; language!'</p>
<p>
'You split-prick shit, I told you to <I>stop</I>!'</p>
<p>
'Oh. Did you? I didn't quite catch that. Sorry.'</p>
<p>
She stopped then, hearing the utter lack of concern in the machine's
voice. She thought very clearly that she had a choice here; she could
collapse weeping and sobbing and not get over this for a long time,
and maybe never be out of the shadow of the contrast between the
drone's cool and her breakdown; or.</p>
<p>
She took a deep breath, <I>calmed</I> herself.</p>
<p>
She walked up to the drone and said quietly, 'All right; this time...
you get away with it. Enjoy it when you play it back.' She put one
hand flat on the drone's side. 'Yeah; enjoy. But if you ever do
anything like that again...' she slapped its flank softly and
whispered, 'you're ore, understand?'</p>
<p>
'Absolutely,' said the drone.</p>
<p>
'Slag; components; motherjunk.'</p>
<p>
'Oh, please, no,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw sighed.</p>
<p>
'I'm serious. You use minimum force from now on. Understand? Agree?'</p>
<p>
'Both.'</p>
<p>
She turned, picked up her bag and headed for the door, glancing once
into the adjoining room through the hole the first man had made. The
woman in there had fled. The man's body was still cratered into the
wall, blood like rays of ejecta.</p>
<p>
Sma looked back to the machine, and spat on the floor.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'The <I>Xenophobe's</I> heading this way,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said,
suddenly there in front of her, its body shining in the sunlight.
'Here.' It stretched a field out, offering her the little chain of
bright flowers it had made.</p>
<p>
Sma bowed towards it; the machine slipped the chain over her head
like a necklace. She stood up and they went back into the castle.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The very top of the keep was out of bounds to the public; it bristled
with aerials and masts and a couple of slowly revolving radar units.
Two floors below, once the tour party had disappeared round the
curve of the gallery, Sma and the machine stopped at a thick metal
door. The drone used its electromagnetic effector to disable the
door's alarm and open the electronic locks, then inserted a field
into a mechanical lock, jiggled the tumblers and swung the door wide.
Sma slipped through, immediately followed by the machine, which
relocked the door. They ascended to the broad, cluttered roof,
beneath the vault of turquoise sky; a tiny scout missile the drone
had sent ahead sidled up to the machine and was taken back inside.</p>
<p>
'When's it get here?' Sma said, listening to the warm wind hum
through the jagged spaces of the aerials around her.</p>
<p>
'It's over there,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said, jabbing forward. She looked
in the direction it had indicated, and could just make out the spare,
curved outline of a four-person module, sitting nearby; it was giving
a very good impression of being transparent.</p>
<p>
Sma looked around the forest of masts and stays for a moment, the
wind ruffling her hair, then shook her head. She walked to the
module-shape, momentarily dizzied by the sensation that there wasn't
anything there, then that there was. A door swung up from the
module's side, revealing the interior as though opening a passageway
into another world, which was - in a sense, she supposed - exactly
what it was doing.</p>
<p>
She and the drone entered. 'Welcome aboard, Ms Sma,' said the module.</p>
<p>
'Hello.'</p>
<p>
The door closed. The module tipped back on its rear end, like a
predator preparing to pounce. It waited a moment for a flock of birds
to clear the airspace a hundred metres above, then it was gone,
powering into the air. Watching from the ground - if they hadn't
blinked at the wrong moment - a very keen-eyed observer might just
have seen a column of trembling air flick skyward from the summit of
the keep, but would have heard nothing; even in high supersonic the
module could move more quietly than any bird, displacing tissue-thin
layers of air immediately ahead of it, moving into the vacuum so
created, and replacing the gases in the skin-thin space it had left
behind; a falling feather produced more turbulence.</p>
<p>
Standing in the module, gazing at the main screen, Sma watched the
view beneath the module shrink rapidly, as the concentric layers of
the castle's defences came crashing in like time-reversed waves from
the edges of the screen; the castle became a dot between the city and
the straits, and then the city itself disappeared and the view began
to tip as the module angled out for its rendezvous with the very fast
picket <I>Xenophobe.</I></p>
<p>
Sma sat down, still watching the screen, eyes searching in vain for
the valley on the outskirts of the city where the dam and the old
power station lay.</p>
<p>
The drone watched too, while it signalled to the waiting ship and
received confirmation the vessel had displaced Sma's luggage out of
the trunk of the car and into the woman's quarters on board.</p>
<p>
Skaffen-Amtiskaw studied Sma, as she stared - a little glumly, it
thought - at the hazing-over view on the module screen, and wondered
when the best time would be to give her the rest of the bad news.</p>
<p>
Because, despite all this wonderful technology, somehow (incredibly;
uniquely, as far as the drone knew... how in the name of chaos did a
lump of meat outwit and destroy a <I>knife missile</I>?), the man
called Cheradenine Zakalwe had shaken off the tail they'd put on him
after he'd resigned the last time.</p>
<p>
So, before they did anything else, Sma and it had to find the damn
human first. If they could.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The figure slipped from behind a radar housing and crossed the keep's
roof, beneath the wind-moaning aerials. It went down the spiral of
steps, checked all was clear beyond the thick metal door, then opened
it.</p>
<p>
A minute later, something that looked exactly like Diziet Sma joined
the tour party, while the guide was explaining how developments in
artillery, heavier-than-air flight and rocketry had made the ancient
fortress obsolete.</p>

<p>
They shared their eyrie with the state coach of the Mythoclast, a
cluttered army of statues, and a jumble of assorted chests, cases and
cupboards packed with treasure from a dozen great houses.</p>
<p>
Astil Tremerst Keiver selected a roquelaure from a tall chiffonier,
closed the cabinet's door and admired himself in the mirror. Yes, the
cloak looked very fine on him, very fine indeed. He flourished it,
pirouetting, drew his ceremonial rifle from its scabbard, and then
made a circuit of the room, around the grand state coach, making a
'ki-shauw, ki-shauw!' noise, and pointing the gun at each
black-curtained window in turn as he swept by them (his shadow
dancing gloriously across the walls and the cold grey outlines of the
statues), before arriving back at the fireplace, sheathing the rifle,
and sitting suddenly and imperiously down on a highly-wrought little
chair of finest bloodwood.</p>
<p>
The chair collapsed. He thumped into the flagstones and the bolstered
gun at the side fired, sending a round into the angle between the
floor and the curve of wall behind him.</p>
<p>
'Shit, shit, shit!' he cried, inspecting his breeks and cloak,
respectively grazed and holed.</p>
<p>
The door of the state coach burst open and someone flew out, crashing
into an escritoire and demolishing it. The man was still and steady
in an instant, presenting - in that infuriatingly efficient martial
way of his - the smallest possible target, and pointing the
appallingly large and ugly plasma cannon straight at the face of
deputy vice-regent-in-waiting Astil Tremerst Keiver the Eighth.</p>
<p>
'Eek! Zakalwe!' Keiver heard himself say, and threw the cloak over
his head. (Damn!)</p>
<p>
When Keiver brought the cloak down again - with, he felt, all the not
inconsiderable dignity he could muster - the mercenary was already
rising from the debris of the little desk, taking a quick look round
the room, and switching off the plasma weapon.</p>
<p>
Keiver was, naturally, immediately aware of the hateful similarity of
their positions, and so stood up quickly.</p>
<p>
'Ah. Zakalwe. I beg your pardon. Did I wake you?'</p>
<p>
The man scowled, glanced down at the remains of the escritoire,
slammed shut the door of the state coach, and said, 'No; just a bad
dream.'</p>
<p>
'Ah. Good.' Keiver fiddled with the ornamental pommel of his gun,
wishing that Zakalwe didn't make him feel - so unjustifiably, dammit
- inferior, and crossed in front of the fireplace to sit (carefully,
this time) on a preposterous porcelain throne stationed to one side
of the hearth.</p>
<p>
He watched the mercenary sit down on the hearth-stone, leaving the
plasma cannon on the floor in front of him and stretching. 'Well, a
half watch's sleep will have to suffice.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm,' Keiver said, feeling awkward. He glanced at the ceremonial
coach the other man had been sleeping in, and so recently vacated.
'Ah.' Keiver drew the roquelaure about him, and smiled. 'I don't
suppose you know the story behind that old carriage, do you?'</p>
<p>
The mercenary - the so-called (Ha!) War Minister - shrugged. 'Well,'
he said. 'The version I heard was that in the Interregnum, the
Archpresbyter told the Mythoclast he could have the tribute, income
and souls of all the monasteries he could raise his state coach
above, using one horse. The Mythoclast accepted, founded this castle
and erected this tower with foreign loans, and using a highly
efficient pulley system powered by his prize stallion, winched the
coach up here during the Thirty Golden Days to claim every monastery
in the land. He won the bet and the resulting war, disestablished the
Final Priesthood, paid off his debts, and only perished because the
groom in charge of the prize stallion objected to the fact that the
beast died of its exertions, and strangled him with its blood and
foam-flecked bridle... which, according to legend, is immured within
the base of the porcelain throne you're sitting on. So we're told.'
He looked at the other man and shrugged again.</p>
<p>
Keiver was aware that his mouth was hanging open. He closed it. 'Ah,
you know the story.'</p>
<p>
'No; just a wild guess.'</p>
<p>
Keiver hesitated, then laughed loudly. 'By hell! You're a rum chap,
Zakalwe!'</p>
<p>
The mercenary stirred the remains of the bloodwood chair with one
heavily-booted foot, and said nothing.</p>
<p>
Keiver was aware that he ought to do something, and so stood. He
wandered to the nearest window, drew back the drape and unlocked the
interior shutters, levered the external shutters aside and stood, arm
against the stones, gazing out at the view beyond.</p>
<p>
The Winter Palace, besieged.</p>
<p>
Outside, on the snow-strewn plain, amongst the fires and trenches,
there were huge wooden siege structures and missile launchers, heavy
artillery and rock-throwing catapults; juried field projectors and
gas-powered-searchlights; a heinous collection of blatant
anachronisms, developmental paradoxes and technological
juxtapositions. And they called it progress.</p>
<p>
'I don't know,' Keiver breathed. 'Men fire guided missiles, from
their mounts' saddles; jets are shot down by guided arrows;
throw-knives explode like artillery shells, or like as not get turned
back by ancestral armour backed by these damned field projectors...
where's it all to end, eh, Zakalwe?'</p>
<p>
'Here, in about three heartbeats, if you don't close those shutters
or pull the black-out drapes behind you.' He stabbed at the logs in
the grate with a poker.</p>
<p>
'Ha!' Keiver withdrew rapidly from the window, half ducking as he
pulled the lever to close the external shutters. 'Quite!' He hauled
the drape across the window, dusting down his hands, watching the
other man as he prodded at the logs in the fire. 'Indeed!' He took
his place on the porcelain throne again.</p>
<p>
Of course, Mr so-called War Minister Zakalwe liked to pretend he did
have an idea where it was all going to end; he claimed to have some
sort of explanation for it all, about outside forces, the balance of
technology, and the erratic escalation of military wizardry. He
always seemed to be hinting at greater themes and conflicts, beyond
the mere here-and-now, forever trying to establish some - frankly
laughable - otherworldly superiority. As though that made any
difference to the fact that he was nothing more than a mercenary - a
very lucky mercenary - who'd happened to catch the ear of the Sacred
Heirs and impress them with a mixture of absurdly risky exploits and
cowardly plans, while the one he'd been paired with - him, Astil
Tremerst Keiver the Eighth, deputy regent-in-waiting, no less - had
behind him a thousand years of breeding, natural seniority and -
indeed, for that was just the way things were, dammit - superiority.
After all, what sort of War Minister - even in these desperate days -
was so incapable of delegating that he had to sit out a watch up
here, waiting for an attack that would probably never come?</p>
<p>
Keiver glanced at the other man, sitting staring into the flames, and
wondered what he was thinking.</p>
<p>
<I>I blame Sma. She got me into this crock of shit.</I></p>
<p>
He looked around the cluttered spaces of the room. What had he to do
with idiots like Keiver, with all this historical junk, with any of
this? He didn't feel part of it, could not identify with it, and he
did not entirely blame them for not listening to him. He supposed he
did have the satisfaction of knowing that he had warned the fools,
but that was little enough to warm yourself with, on a cold and
closing night like this.</p>
<p>
He'd fought; put his life at risk for them, won a few desperate
rear-guard actions, and he had tried to tell them what they ought to
do; but they'd listened too late, and given him some limited power
only after the war was already more or less lost. But that was just
the way they were; they were the bosses, and if their whole way of
life vanished because it was a tenet of that way that people like
them automatically knew how to make war better than even the most
experienced commoners or outsiders, then that was not unjust;
everything came level in the end. And if it meant their deaths, let
them all die.</p>
<p>
In the meantime, while supplies held out, what could be more
pleasant? No more long cold marches, no boggy excuses for camps, no
outside latrines, no scorched earth to try and scrape a meal from.
Not much action, and maybe he would get itchy feet eventually, but
that was more than compensated for by being able to satisfy the more
highly-placed itches of some of the noble ladies also trapped in the
castle.</p>
<p>
Anyway, he knew in his heart that there was a relief in not being
listened to, sometimes. Power meant responsibility. Advice unacted
upon almost always <I>might</I> have been right, and in the working
out of whatever plan was followed, there was anyway always blood;
better it was on their hands. The good soldier did as he was told,
and if he had any sense at all volunteered for nothing, especially
promotion.</p>
<p>
'Ha,' Keiver said, rocking in the china chair. 'We found more grass
seed today.'</p>
<p>
'Oh, good.'</p>
<p>
'Indeed.'</p>
<p>
Most of the courtyards, gardens and patios were already given over to
pasture; they'd torn the roofs off some of the less architecturally
important halls and planted there as well. If they weren't blown to
bits in the meantime, they might - in theory - feed a quarter of the
castle's garrison indefinitely.</p>
<p>
Keiver shivered, and wrapped the cloak more tightly about his legs.
'But this is a cold old place, Zakalwe, isn't it?'</p>
<p>
He was about to say something in reply when the door at the far end
of the room opened a crack.</p>
<p>
He grabbed the plasma cannon.</p>
<p>
'Is... is everything all right?' said a quiet, female voice.</p>
<p>
He put the gun down, smiling at the small pale face peering from the
doorway, long black hair following the line of the door's studded
wood.</p>
<p>
'Ah, Neinte!' Keiver exclaimed, rising only to bow deeply to the
young girl (princess, indeed!) who was - technically, at least, not
that that precluded other, more productive, even lucrative,
relationships in the future - his ward.</p>
<p>
'Come on in,' he heard the mercenary tell the girl.</p>
<p>
(Damn him, always taking the initiative like that; who did he think
he was?)</p>
<p>
The girl crept into the room, gathering her skirts in front of her.
'I thought I heard a shot...'</p>
<p>
The mercenary laughed. 'That was a little time ago,' he said, rising
to show the girl to a seat near the fire.</p>
<p>
'Well,' she said, 'I had to dress...'</p>
<p>
The man laughed louder.</p>
<p>
'My lady,' Keiver said, rising slightly late, and flourishing what
would now - thanks to Zakalwe - look like a rather awkward bow.
'Forfend we should have disturbed your maidenly slumber...'</p>
<p>
Keiver heard the other man stifle a guffaw as he kicked a log further
into the fire. The princess Neinte giggled. Keiver felt his face heat
up, and decided to laugh.</p>
<p>
Neinte - still very young, but already beautiful in a delicate,
fragile way - wrapped her arms round her drawn-up legs, and stared
into the fire.</p>
<p>
He looked from her to Keiver, in the silence that followed (except
that the deputy vice-regent-in-waiting said, 'Yes, well.'), and
thought - as the logs crackled and the scarlet flames danced - how
like statues the two young people suddenly looked.</p>
<p>
Just once, he thought, I'd like to know whose side I'm really on in
something like this. Here I am, in this absurd fortress, packed with
riches, crammed with concentrated nobility - such as it was, he
thought, watching Keiver's vacant-looking eyes - facing out the
hordes beyond (all claw and tackle, brute force and brute
intelligence) trying to protect these delicate, simpering products of
a millennia's privilege, and never knowing whether I'm doing the
tactically or the strategically right thing.</p>
<p>
The Minds did not assume such distinctions; to them, there was no
cut-off between the two. Tactics cohered into strategy, strategy
disintegrated into tactics, in the sliding scale of their dialectical
moral algebra. It was all more than they ever expected the mammal
brain to cope with.</p>
<p>
He recalled what Sma had said to him, long long ago back in that new
beginning (itself the product of so much guilt and pain); that they
dealt in the intrinsically untoward, where rules were forged as you
went along and were never the same twice anyway, where just by the
nature of things nothing could be known, or predicted, or even judged
with any real certainty. It all sounded very sophisticated and
abstract and challenging to work with, but in the end it came down to
people and problems.</p>
<p>
This girl was what it came down to, here, this time; barely more than
a child, and trapped in the great stone castle with the rest of the
cream or scum (depending on how you looked at it), to live or die,
depending on how well I advise, and on how capable these clowns are
of taking that advice.</p>
<p>
He looked at the girl's, flame-lit face, and felt something more than
distant desire (for she was attractive), or fatherly protectiveness
(for she was so young, and he, despite his appearance, so old). Call
it... he didn't know what. A realisation; an awareness of the
tragedy the whole episode represented; the break-up of the Rule, the
dissolution of power and privilege and the whole elaborate, top-heavy
system this child represented.</p>
<p>
The muck and dirt, the king with fleas. For theft, mutilation; for
the wrong thoughts, death. An infant mortality rate as astronomical
as the life-expectancy was minute, and the whole grisly, working
package wrapped in a skein of wealth and advantage designed to
maintain the dark dominion of the knowing over the ignorant (and the
worst of it was the pattern; the repetition; the twisted variations
of the same depraved theme in so many different places).</p>
<p>
So this girl, called a princess. Would she die? The war was going
against them, he knew, and the same symbolic grammar that presented
her with the prospect of power if things went well, also dictated her
use, her expendability, if all failed about them. Rank demanded its
tribute; the obsequious bow or the mean stab, according to the
outcome of this struggle.</p>
<p>
He saw her suddenly old, in the flickering firelight. He saw her shut
in some slimed dungeon, waiting, hoping, scabbed with lice and ragged
in sack-cloth, head shaved, eyes dark and hollow in the raw skin, and
finally marched out one snow-filled day, to be nailed to a wall with
arrows or bullets, or face the cold axe blade.</p>
<p>
Or maybe that too was too romantic. Maybe there would be some
desperate flight to asylum, a lonely and bitter exile spent growing
old and worn, barren and senile, forever remembering the ever more
golden old times, composing futile petitions, hoping for a return,
but growing slowly, inevitably, into something like the pampered
uselessness her upbringing had always conditioned her for, but
without any of the compensations she had been bred to expect from her
station.</p>
<p>
With a feeling of sickness, he saw that she meant nothing. She was
just another irrelevant part of another history, heading - with or
without the Culture's carefully evaluated nudges in what they saw as
the right direction - for what would probably be better times and an
easier life for most. But not her, he suspected, not right at this
moment.</p>
<p>
Born twenty years earlier, she might have expected a good marriage, a
productive estate, access to the court, and lusty sons, talented
daughters... twenty years from now, perhaps an astutely mercantile
husband, or even - in the unlikely event this particular genderist
society was heading that way so soon - a life of her own; academic,
in business, doing good works; whatever.</p>
<p>
But, probably, death.</p>
<p>
High in a turret of a great castle rising on a black crag above snowy
plains, besieged and grand, crammed full of an empire's treasure, and
he sitting by a log fire was a sad and lovely princess... I used to
dream about such things, he thought. I used to long for them, ache
for them. They seemed the very stuff of life, its essence. So why
does all this taste of ashes?</p>
<p>
<I>I should have stayed on that beach, Sma. Perhaps after all I am
getting too old for this.</I></p>
<p>
He made himself look away from the girl. Sma said he tended to get
too involved, and she was not totally wrong. He'd done what they'd
asked; he'd be paid, and at the end of all this, after all, there was
his own attempt to claim absolution for a past crime. <I>Livueta, say
you will forgive me.</I></p>
<p>
'Oh!' The princess Neinte had just noticed the wreckage of the
bloodwood chair.</p>
<p>
'Yes,' Keiver stirred uncomfortably. 'That, ah... that was, umm, me,
I'm afraid. Was it yours? Your family's?'</p>
<p>
'Oh, no! But I knew it; it belonged to my uncle; the archduke. It
used to be in his hunting lodge. It had a great big animal's head
above it. I was always frightened to sit in it because I dreamt the
head would fall from the wall and one of the tusks would stick right
into my head and I'd die!' She looked at both men in turn and giggled
nervously. 'Wasn't I silly?'</p>
<p>
'Ha!' said Keiver.</p>
<p>
(While he watched them both and shivered. And tried to smile.)</p>
<p>
'Well,' Keiver laughed. 'You must promise not to tell your uncle that
I broke his little seat, or I shall never be invited to one of his
hunts again!' Keiver laughed louder. 'Why, I might even end up with
my head fixed on one of his walls!'</p>
<p>
The girl squealed and put a hand to her mouth.</p>
<p>
(He looked away, shivering again, then threw a piece of wood onto the
fire, and did not notice then or afterwards that it was a piece of
the bloodwood chair he had added to the flames, and not a log at
all.)</p>

<p>
Sma suspected a lot of ship crews were crazy. For that matter, she
suspected a fair few of the ships themselves weren't totally together
in the sanity department, either. There were only twenty people on
the very fast picket <I>Xenophobe</I>, and Sma had noticed that - as
a general rule - the smaller the crew, the weirder the behaviour. So
she was already prepared for the ship's staff being pretty off the
wall even before the module entered the ship's hangar.</p>
<p>
'Ah-choo!' the young crewman sneezed, covering his nose with one hand
while extending the other to Sma as she stepped from the module. Sma
jerked her hand back, looking at the young man's red nose and
streaming eyes. 'Ais Disgarb, Ms Sma,' the fellow said, blinking and
sniffing, and looking hurt, 'Belcome aboard.'</p>
<p>
Sma put her hand out again cautiously. The crewman's hand was
extremely hot. 'Thank you,' Sma said.</p>
<p>
'Skaffen-Amtiskaw,' the drone said from behind her.</p>
<p>
'Heddo,' the young man waved at the drone. He took a small piece of
cloth from one sleeve and dabbed at his leaky eyes and nose.</p>
<p>
'Are you entirely all right?' Sma said.</p>
<p>
'Dot really,' he said. 'God a cold. Blease,' he indicated to one
side, 'cob with be.'</p>
<p>
'A cold,' Sma nodded, falling into step alongside the fellow; he was
dressed in a jellaba, as though he'd just got out of bed.</p>
<p>
'Yes,' the young man said, leading the way through the <I>Xenophobe</I>'s
collection of smallcraft, satellites and assorted paraphernalia
towards the rear of the hangar. He sneezed again, sniffed. 'Sobthig
ob a fad on the shib ad the bow-bid.' (Here Sma, immediately behind
the man as they walked between two closely parked modules, turned
quickly back to look at Skaffen-Amtiskaw and mouthed the word.
'<I>What</I>?' at it, but the machine wobbled, shrugging. ME NEITHER
it printed on its aura field, in letters of grey on a rosy
background.) 'Be all tought it'd be abusing to relax our ibude
systebs and cadge colds,' the young crewman explained, showing her
and the drone into an elevator at one end of the hangar.</p>
<p>
'All of you?' Sma said, as the door closed and the elevator rolled
and rose. 'The whole crew?'</p>
<p>
'Yes, dough dot all ad the sabe tibe. The peebil who've recobered say
id's very pleasid abter it's ober.'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' Sma said, glancing at the drone, which was keeping a standard
pattern of formal blue on its aura field, apart from one large red
dot on its side that probably only she could see; it was pulsing
rapidly. When she noticed it she almost started laughing herself. She
cleared her throat. 'Yes, I suppose it would be.'</p>
<p>
The young man sneezed mightily.</p>
<p>
'Due for a spot of R-and-R soon, are we?' Skaffen-Amtiskaw asked him.
Sma nudged the machine with her elbow.</p>
<p>
The young crewman looked puzzledly at the machine. 'Jusd bidished
sub, adjilly.'</p>
<p>
He glanced away to the elevator door as it started to open,
Skaffen-Amtiskaw and Sma exchanged looks; Sma crossed her eyes.</p>
<p>
They stepped into a wide social area, floored and walled with some
dark red wood, polished to the point of gleaming; it supported a
variety of richly upholstered couches and chairs, and a few low
tables. The ceiling wasn't particularly high, but very attractive,
composed of great flutes of gathered-up material rippling in from
the walls and hung with many little lanterns. From the light level,
it looked to be early morning, ship time. A group of people round one
of the tables broke up and came towards her.</p>
<p>
'Biz Sba,' the young crewman said indicating Sma, his voice seeming
to get thicker all the time. The other people - about fifty-fifty men
and women - smiled, introduced themselves. She nodded, exchanged a
few words; the drone said hello.</p>
<p>
One of the people in the group held a little bundle of brown and
yellow fur, cradled against one shoulder rather as one might hold a
baby. 'Here.' the man said, presenting the tiny furry creature to
Sma. She took it reluctantly. It was warm, had four limbs arranged
conventionally, smelled attractive and wasn't any sort of animal
she'd ever seen before; it had large ears on a large head, and as she
held it, it opened its huge eyes and looked at her. 'That's the
ship,' the man who'd handed her the animal said.</p>
<p>
'Hello,' the tiny being squeaked.</p>
<p>
Sma looked it up and down. 'You're the <I>Xenophobe</I>?'</p>
<p>
'Its representative. The bit you can talk to. You can call me Xeny.'
It smiled; it had little round teeth. 'I know most ships just use a
drone, but,' it glanced at Skaffen-Amtiskaw, 'they can be a bit
boring, don't you think?'</p>
<p>
Sma smiled, and sensed Skaffen-Amtiskaw's aura flicker out of the
corner of her eye. 'Well, sometimes,' she agreed.</p>
<p>
'Oh yes,' the little creature said, nodding. 'I'm <I>much</I> cuter.'
It wriggled in her hands, looking happy. 'If you like,' it giggled,
'I'll show you to your cabin, yes?'</p>
<p>
'Yes; good idea,' nodded Sma, and put the thing over her shoulder.
The crewpeople called out to say they'd see her later as she, the
ship's bizarre remote drone and Skaffen-Amtiskaw headed for the
accommodation section.</p>
<p>
'Ooh, you're nice and warm,' the little brown and yellow creature
mumbled sleepily, snuggling into Sma's neck as they headed down a
deeply carpeted corridor for Sma's quarters. It stirred and she found
herself patting its back. 'Left here,' it said, at a junction, then,
That's us just breaking orbit now, by the way.'</p>
<p>
'Good,' Sma said.</p>
<p>
'Can I cuddle up with you when you sleep?'</p>
<p>
Sma stopped, detached the creature from her shoulder with one hand
and stared it in the face. 'What?'</p>
<p>
'Just for chumminess' sake,' the little thing said, yawning wide and
blinking. 'I'm not being rude; it's a good bonding procedure.'</p>
<p>
Sma was aware of Skaffen-Amtiskaw glowing red just behind her. She
brought the yellow and brown device closer to her face. 'Listen,
<I>Xenophobe</I> -'</p>
<p>
'Xeny.'</p>
<p>
'Xeny; you are a million-tonne starship; a Torturer class Rapid
Offensive Unit. Even -'</p>
<p>
'But I'm demilitarised!'</p>
<p>
'Even without your principal armament, I bet you could waste planets
if you wanted to -'</p>
<p>
'Aw, come on; any silly GCU can do <I>that</I>!'</p>
<p>
'So what is all this shit for?' She shook the furry little remote
drone, quite hard. Its teeth chattered.</p>
<p>
'It's for a laugh!' it cried. 'Sma; don't you appreciate a joke?'</p>
<p>
'I don't know. Do you appreciate being drop-kicked back to the
accommodation area?'</p>
<p>
'Ooo! What's your problem, lady? Have you got something against small
furry animals, or what? Look, Ms Sma; I know very well I'm a ship,
and I do everything I'm asked to do - including taking you to this
frankly rather fuzzily specified destination - and do it very
efficiently, too. If there was the slightest sniff of any real
action, and I had to start acting like a warship, this construct in
your hands would go lifeless and limp immediately, and I'd battle as
ferociously and decisively as I've been trained to. Meanwhile, like
my human colleagues, I amuse myself harmlessly. If you really hate my
current appearance, all right; I'll change it; I'll be an ordinary
drone, or just a disembodied voice, or talk to you through
Skaffen-Amtiskaw here, or through your personal terminal. The last
thing I want to do is <I>offend </I>a guest.'</p>
<p>
Sma pursed her lips. She patted the thing on its head, and sighed.
'Fair enough.'</p>
<p>
'I can keep this shape?'</p>
<p>
'By all means.'</p>
<p>
'Oh goody!' It squirmed with pleasure, then opened its big eyes wide
and looked hopefully at her. 'Cuddle?'</p>
<p>
'Cuddle.' Sma cuddled it, patted its back.</p>
<p>
She turned to see Skaffen-Amtiskaw lying dramatically on its back in
mid-air, its aura field flashing the lurid orange that was used to
signal Sick Drone in Extreme Distress.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Sma nodded goodbye to the little brown and yellow animal as it
waddled away down the corridor which led back to the social area (it
waved back with one chubby little paw), then closed the cabin door
and made sure the room's internal monitoring was off.</p>
<p>
She turned to Skaffen-Amtiskaw. '<I>How</I> long are we on this ship
for?'</p>
<p>
'Thirty days?' Skaffen-Amtiskaw suggested.</p>
<p>
Sma gritted her teeth and looked round the fairly cosy-looking but -
compared to the echoing spaces of the old power station mansion -
rather small cabin. 'Thirty days with a crew of viral masochists and
a ship that thinks it's a cuddly toy.' She shook her head, sat into
the bed field. 'Subjectively, drone, this could be a long trip.' She
collapsed back into the bed, muttering.</p>
<p>
Skaffen-Amtiskaw decided right now would probably still not be the
best time to tell the woman about Zakalwe being missing.</p>
<p>
'I'll just go and take a look round, if you don't mind,' it said,
drifting towards the door over the neat line of bags that was Sma's
luggage.</p>
<p>
'Yeah, on you go,' Sma waved one arm lazily, then shucked off the
jacket and let it fall to the deck.</p>
<p>
The drone had almost made it to the door when Sma sat bolt upright, a
frown on her face, and said, 'Wait a minute; what did the ship mean
about &quot;... rather fuzzily specified destination&quot;? Doesn't
it know where the hell we're going?'</p>
<p>
<I>Oh-oh</I>, thought the drone.</p>
<p>
It spun in the air. 'Ah,' it said.</p>
<p>
Sma's eyes narrowed. 'We are just going to get Zakalwe, aren't we?'</p>
<p>
'Yes. Of course.'</p>
<p>
'We're not doing anything else?'</p>
<p>
'Absolutely not. We find Zakalwe; we brief him; we take him to
Voerenhutz. Simple as that. We might be asked to hang around for a
bit, overseeing, but that isn't definite yet.'</p>
<p>
'Yes, yes, I expected that, but... where exactly is Zakalwe?'</p>
<p>
'Where <I>exactly</I>?' The drone said. 'Well, I mean; you know,
that's...'</p>
<p>
'All right,' Sma said, exasperated, 'approximately, then.'</p>
<p>
'No problem,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said, backing off towards the door.</p>
<p>
'No problem?' Sma said, puzzled.</p>
<p>
'Yes; no problem. We know that. Where he is.'</p>
<p>
'Good,' Sma nodded. 'Well?'</p>
<p>
'Well what?'</p>
<p>
'Well,' Sma said loudly, 'where is he?'</p>
<p>
'Crastalier.'</p>
<p>
'Cras...?'</p>
<p>
'Crastalier. That's where we're heading.'</p>
<p>
Sma shook her head, yawned. 'Never heard of it.' She flopped back in
the bed field, stretching. 'Crastalier.' Her yawn deepened; she put a
hand to her mouth. 'You only had to say that the first time,
goddamit.'</p>
<p>
'Sorry,' the drone said.</p>
<p>
'Mmm. Never mind.' Sma put out one hand, waved it through the bedside
beam that controlled the cabin lights, so that they dimmed. She
yawned again. 'Think I'll catch some sleep. Take my boots off, will
you?'</p>
<p>
Gently but quickly, the drone slipped Sma's boots off, gathered her
jacket and hung it in a walk-in cupboard, swept the bags in there
too, then - as Sma turned over in the bed field, eyes fluttering
closed - the drone slipped out of the room.</p>
<p>
It hovered in the air outside, looking at its reflection in the
polished wood on the far side of the corridor.</p>
<p>
'That,' it said to itself, 'was close.' Then it went for a wander.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Sma had arrived on the <I>Xenophobe</I> just after breakfast, by ship
time. When she awoke, it was early afternoon. She was completing her
toilet, while the drone sorted her clothes into type and colour order
and hung or folded them in the cupboard, when the door chimed. Sma
wandered out of the little bathroom area, wearing a pair of shorts,
her mouth full of toothpaste. She tried saying Open, but the
toothpaste apparently stopped the room monitor from recognising the
word. She walked over and pressed the door-open instead.</p>
<p>
Sma eye's flicked wide; she yelped, spluttered, jumped back from the
door, a scream gathering in her throat.</p>
<p>
The instant after her eyes had widened, before the signal to jump
back from the door had travelled all the way to her leg muscles,
there was an impression of almost invisibly sudden movement in the
cabin, belatedly followed by a bang and a sizzling sound.</p>
<p>
There, stationed between her and the door, were all three of the
drone's knife missiles, hovering roughly level with her eyes, sternum
and groin; she was looking at them through a haze of field the
machine had also thrown in front of her. Then it clicked off.</p>
<p>
The knife missiles swung lazily away through the air and clicked back
into Skaffen-Amtiskaw's casing. 'Don't <I>do</I> that to me,' the
machine muttered, returning to sorting out Sma's socks.</p>
<p>
Sma wiped her mouth and stared at the three-metre tall, brown and
yellow coloured furry monster cowering in the corridor outside the
door.</p>
<p>
'Ship... Xeny, what the <I>hell</I> are you doing?'</p>
<p>
'I'm sorry,' the huge creature said, its voice only a little deeper
than when it had been baby-sized. 'I thought if you didn't relate to
a small furry animal, perhaps a bigger version...'</p>
<p>
'Shee-it.' Sma said, shaking her head. 'Come in,' she called, heading
back for the bathroom area. 'Or did you just want to show me how much
you've grown?' She rinsed out the paste and spat.</p>
<p>
Xeny squeezed through the door, stooped, and sidled into a corner.
'Sorry about that, Skaffen-Amtiskaw.'</p>
<p>
'No problem,' the other machine replied.</p>
<p>
'Ah, no, Ms Sma,' Xeny called. 'I actually wanted to talk to you
about...'</p>
<p>
Skaffen-Amtiskaw went still, just for a second. There was, in fact, a
fairly lengthy, detailed and slightly heated exchange between the
drone and the ship's Mind during that time, but Sma was only aware of
Xeny pausing as it spoke.</p>
<p>
'... about having a fancy-dress party, this evening, in your honour,'
the ship improvised.</p>
<p>
Sma smiled from the bathroom area, 'That's a lovely idea, ship. Thank
you, Xeny. Yes; why not?'</p>
<p>
'Good; I just thought I'd check with you, first. Any ideas about
costumes?'</p>
<p>
Sma laughed. 'Yeah; I'll go as you; make me one of those suits you're
wearing.'</p>
<p>
'Ha. Yes. Good idea. Actually, that might be rather a common choice,
but we'll make it two people can't go as the same thing. Right. I'll
talk to you later.' Xeny lumbered from the room and the door slid
shut. Sma appeared out from the bathroom area, slightly surprised at
this sudden departure, but just shrugged.</p>
<p>
'Short but eventful visit,' she observed, rummaging through the socks
Skaffen-Amtiskaw had just carefully arranged in chromatic order.
'That machine's weird.'</p>
<p>
'What do you expect?' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said. 'It's a star-ship.'</p>
<p>
- You might (the ship Mind communicated to Skaffen-Amtiskaw) have
told me you were keeping the size of our target destination from her.</p>
<p>
- I am hoping (the drone replied) that our people already out there
will find the guy we're looking for and give us an exact position, in
which case Sma will never need to know there was ever any problem.</p>
<p>
- Indeed, but why not just be honest with her in the first place?</p>
<p>
- Ha! You don't know Sma!</p>
<p>
- Oh. Do I take it she's temperamental?</p>
<p>
- What do you expect? She's a human!</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The ship prepared a feast, and put as many
human-brain-chemistry-altering chemicals into the various dishes and
drinks as was normally regarded proper without attaching a specific
sanity warning to each bowl, plate, jug or glass. It told the crew
about the party, and rearranged the social area, setting up a variety
of mirrors and reverser fields (with a total guest list of only
twenty-two - not including itself - making the place look suitably
crowded was one of the major obstacles it faced in trying to
encourage the feel of a serious, thorough-going whoopee).</p>
<p>
Sma breakfasted, was shown round the ship - though there was little
to see; the ship was almost all engine - and spent most of the rest
of the day reviewing her knowledge of the Voerenhutz cluster's
history and politics.</p>
<p>
The ship sent formal invitations to each of the crew, and specified a
strict rule of No Shop Talk. It hoped that this, plus the narcotic
wealth of the consumables, would keep everybody off the subject of
where exactly they were heading for. It had toyed with the idea of
just telling people there was a problem here and asking them not to
talk about it, but suspected there were at least two of the crew who
would take such a proscription as a challenge to their integrity
requiring them to raise the issue at the first possible opportunity.
It was on occasions like this that the <I>Xenophobe</I> tended to
consider changing its status to that of an unstaffed ship, but it
knew it would miss the humans if it did decide to ask them to leave;
they were fun to have around, usually.</p>
<p>
The ship played loud music, showed exciting screen holos, and set up
a fabulous surrounding holo landscape of lush green and blue, filled
with floating bushes and hovering trees where strange, eight-winged
birds capered and beyond which a glowing white layer of mist plied by
tall, feathery cloudships extended to neck-stretchingly tall cliffs
of pastel-shaded rock, set about with further small clouds, draped
with blue and sparkling gold waterfalls, and topped by fabulous
cities of spires and slender bridges. Ship-slaved soligrams of famous
historical figures wandered about the party, adding to the illusion
of numbers, and were only too happy to engage the disguised revellers
in conversation. More treats and surprises were promised for later.</p>
<p>
Sma went as Xeny, Skaffen-Amtiskaw as a model of the <I>Xenophobe</I>,
and the ship itself produced yet another remote drone; an aquatic
one, still brown and yellow, but looking like a rather fat and
large-eyed fish, and floating in a field-held metre-diameter sphere
of water which drifted through the party-space like some odd balloon.</p>
<p>
'Ais Disgarve, who you've met before,' the ship drone said, voice
sounding rather bubbly as it introduced Sma to the young man who'd
greeted her in the hangar the day before. 'And Jetart Hrine.'</p>
<p>
Sma smiled, nodded at Disgarve - making a mental note to stop
thinking of him as Disgarb - and the young woman at his side.</p>
<p>
'Hello again. How do you do?'</p>
<p>
'Heddo,' said Disgarve, dressed as some sort of ancient cold-climate
explorer, all swathed in furs.</p>
<p>
'Hi,' Jetart Hrine said. She was quite short and round, very young
looking, and her skin was so black it was almost blue. She wore some
ancient - and surprisingly brightly coloured - military uniform, and
sported a smooth-bore projectile rifle slung over one shoulder. She
sipped from a glass and said. 'I know there's no shop talk, Ms Sma,
but frankly Ais and I have been wondering why our dest -'</p>
<p>
'Aah!' the ship drone said, its water sphere suddenly collapsing.
Water crashed all around the feet of Sma, Hrine and Disgarve, all of
whom jumped back a little. The fish-drone fell to the red wood deck
and flapped around. 'Water!' it croaked. Sma picked it up by the
tail.</p>
<p>
'What happened?' she asked it.</p>
<p>
'Field malfunction. Water! Quickly!'</p>
<p>
Sma looked at Disgarve and Hrine, both of whom seemed rather bemused.
Skaffen-Amtiskaw, in its starship disguise, wound quickly through the
party-goers towards them. 'Water!' the ship drone repeated,
wriggling.</p>
<p>
A frown gathered on Sma's brow, inside the brown and yellow suit. She
looked at the woman dressed as a soldier. 'What were you about to
say, Ms Hrine?'</p>
<p>
'I was - oof!'</p>
<p>
A one-in-five-hundred-and-twelfth scale model of the very fast picket
<I>Xenophobe </I>thumped into the woman, making her stagger
backwards, dropping her glass.</p>
<p>
'Hey!' Disgarve said, pushing the offending Skaffen-Amtiskaw away.
Hrine looked annoyed, and rubbed her shoulder.</p>
<p>
'Sorry; clumsy me!' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said, loudly.</p>
<p>
'Water! Water!' yelped the ship drone, struggling in Sma's furry paw.</p>
<p>
'Shut up!' Sma told it. She went close to Jetart Hrine, putting her
own body between the woman and Skaffen-Amtiskaw. 'Ms Hrine; complete
your question, would you?'</p>
<p>
'I just wanted to know why...'</p>
<p>
The floor shook, the entire landscape around them trembled; light
flashed from high above, and as they looked up, they saw the fabulous
gleaming cities of the cliff tops far above disappear in vast blooms
of light, which slowly faded, leaving falling clouds of debris,
crashing towers and disintegrating bridges. The mighty cliffs split
asunder and kilometres-high tsunami of seething lava and boiling
grey-black clouds of smoke and ash burst out, exploding over the
quivering landscape below, where the cloudships were sinking and the
eight-winged birds were spinning so fast their wings were coming off,
sending them spinning into the blue-green shrubbery in squawking
explosions of feathers and leaves.</p>
<p>
Jetart Hrine stared in disbelief. Sma grabbed the woman's collar with
one paw and shook her. 'It's trying to distract you!' she yelled. She
turned to the fish-drone in her other paw. 'Cut it out!' she screamed
at it. She shook the woman again, while Disgarve tried to pry her paw
away from the woman. Sma shook his hand off. 'What were you trying to
<I>say</I>?'</p>
<p>
'Why don't we know where we're going?' Hrine shouted into Sma's face,
over the noise of the earth splitting open in a gout of flame. A huge
black shape reared from the chasm, red-eyed.</p>
<p>
'We're going to Crastalier!' Sma yelled. A vast silver human baby
appeared in the sky, shining, beatific and be-rayed, spun about with
glowing figures.</p>
<p>
'So what?' Hrine bellowed, as lightning zapped from mega-baby to
earth-beast and thunder assaulted the ears. 'Crastalier's an Open
Cluster; there must be half a million stars in it!'</p>
<p>
Sma froze.</p>
<p>
The holos went back to the way they had been before the cataclysms.
The music resumed, but it was quieter now, and very soothing. The
ship's crew stood around, looking mystified. There was much
shrugging.</p>
<p>
The piscine ship-drone and Skaffen-Amtiskaw exchanged looks. The ship
drone, still held in Sma's paw, suddenly became the holo of a fish
skeleton. Skaffen-Amtiskaw projected the model of the <I>Xenophobe</I>
tumbling disintegrating and trailing smoke to the deck. They both
flashed back to their previous disguises as Sma turned slowly and
looked at them both.</p>
<p>
'An... Open... Cluster?' she said, and took off the brown and yellow
head of the fancy-dress suit.</p>
<p>
Sma's mouth was in the shape of a smile. It was not an expression
Skaffen-Amtiskaw had learned to view with anything other than extreme
trepidation.</p>
<p>
- Oh shit.</p>
<p>
- I think we are in the presence of one annoyed human female,
Skaffen-Amtiskaw.</p>
<p>
- You don't say. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
- None whatsoever. You can field this; my fish-like ass is out of
here.</p>
<p>
- Ship! You can't do this to me!</p>
<p>
- Can and am. This is your prototype. Talk to me later. Bye.</p>
<p>
The fish-drone went limp in Sma's paw. She let it drop to the
water-slicked floor.</p>
<p>
The drone dispensed with the warship disguise; it floated in front of
her, fields on clear. It dipped its front a little, held it there.
'Sma,' it said quietly. 'I'm sorry. I didn't lie but I did deceive.'</p>
<p>
'My cabin,' Sma said calmly, after a brief pause. 'Excuse us,' she
said to Disgarve and Hrine, and walked away, followed by the drone.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
She floated on the bed in the lotus position, naked but for the
shorts, the Xeny suit discarded on the floor. She was glanding <I>calm
</I>and she looked more sad than furious. Skaffen-Amtiskaw -
expecting a fight - was feeling awful, faced with such measured
disappointment.</p>
<p>
'I thought if I told you, you wouldn't come.'</p>
<p>
'Drone; this is my job.'</p>
<p>
'I know, but you were so reluctant to leave...'</p>
<p>
'After three years, with no warning, what do you expect? But how long
did I actually hold out? Even knowing about the stand-in? Come on,
drone; you told me what the situation was and I accepted. There was
no need to keep quiet about Zakalwe giving us the slip.'</p>
<p>
'I'm sorry,' the drone said, very quietly. 'This is inadequate, I
know, but I really am sorry. Please say you might be able to forgive
me one day.'</p>
<p>
'Oh, don't take the contrition bit too far. Just tell me things in
future.'</p>
<p>
'All right.'</p>
<p>
Sma let her head drop for a moment, then brought it back up. 'You can
start by telling me how Zakalwe got away. What did we have trailing
him?'</p>
<p>
'A knife missile.'</p>
<p>
'A <I>knife</I> missile?' Sma looked suitably amazed. She rubbed her
chin with one hand.</p>
<p>
'Quite a late model, too,' the drone said. 'Nanoguns, mono-filament
warps, effector; point seven value brain.'</p>
<p>
'And Zakalwe got <I>away</I> from this beast?' Sma was almost
laughing.</p>
<p>
'Not just away; he wasted it.'</p>
<p>
'Shee-it,' Sma breathed. 'I didn't think Zakalwe was that smart. <I>Was</I>
he smart, or just incredibly lucky? What happened? How did he do it?'</p>
<p>
'Well, it's <I>very</I> secret,' the drone said. 'So please don't
tell anybody at all.'</p>
<p>
'My honour,' Sma said ironically, palm on chest.</p>
<p>
'Well,' the drone said, making a sighing noise. 'It took him a year
to set up but, on the place where we dropped him - after his last job
for us - the local humanoids shared their planet with large sea-going
mammals of about equivalent intelligence; quite a viable symbiotic
relationship, with much cross-cultural contact. Zakalwe - using the
exchange we'd given him as payment for his work - bought a company
which made medical and signalling lasers. His trap involved a
hospital facility the humanoids were setting up on the coast of an
ocean to treat these sea-going mammals. One of the pieces of medical
equipment being tested was a very large Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Scanner.'</p>
<p>
'A what?'</p>
<p>
'Fourth most primitive way of looking inside your average water-based
living being.'</p>
<p>
'Go on.'</p>
<p>
The process involves the use of extremely strong magnetic fields.
Zakalwe was supposedly testing a laser attached to the machine - on a
holiday, when there was nobody else around - when he somehow got the
knife missile to enter the scanning machine, and then turned on the
power.'</p>
<p>
'I thought knife missiles weren't magnetic.'</p>
<p>
'They're not, but there was just enough metal in it to set up
crippling eddy currents if it tried to move too fast.'</p>
<p>
'But it could still move.'</p>
<p>
'Not fast enough to get out of the way of the laser Zakalwe had set
up at one end of the scanner. It was only supposed to illuminate, to
help produce holos of the mammals, but Zakalwe had in fact installed
a military strength device; it grilled the knife missile.'</p>
<p>
'Wow.' Sma nodded, staring down at the floor. 'The man never ceases
to amaze.' She looked at the drone. 'Zakalwe must have wanted away
from us awful bad.'</p>
<p>
'It looks that way,' agreed the drone.</p>
<p>
'So maybe there's no way he'll want to work for us again. Maybe he
never wants even to hear from us again.'</p>
<p>
'I'm afraid that must be a possibility.'</p>
<p>
'Even if we can find him.'</p>
<p>
'Quite.'</p>
<p>
'And all we know is that he's somewhere in an Open Cluster called
Crastalier?' Sma's voice sounded tinged with disbelief.</p>
<p>
'It's a bit more focused than that,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said. 'There
are maybe ten or twelve systems he could be in by now, if he left
immediately after stiffing the knife missile, and took the fastest
ships available. Thankfully, the tech level in the meta-civilisation
isn't <I>that</I> high.' The drone hesitated, then said. 'To be
honest, we might have been able to catch up with him, if we'd gone in
fast and strong immediately... But I think the controlling Minds were
so impressed with Zakalwe's trick they thought he deserved to get
away. We kept a very general watch on the volume, but it's only in
the last ten days the search has become serious. We're bringing in
ships and people from wherever we can now; I'm sure we'll find him.'</p>
<p>
'Ten or twelve systems, drone?' Sma said shaking her head.</p>
<p>
'Twenty-plus planets; maybe three hundred sizeable space habitats...
not including ships, of course.'</p>
<p>
Sma closed her eyes. Her head shook. 'I don't believe this.'</p>
<p>
Skaffen-Amtiskaw thought the better of saying anything.</p>
<p>
The woman's eyes opened. 'Want to pass on a suggestion or two?'</p>
<p>
'Certainly.'</p>
<p>
'Forget the habitats. And forget any planets that aren't fairly
Standard; check out... deserts, temperate zones; forests but not
jungles... and no cities.' She shrugged, rubbed her mouth with her
hand. 'If he's still trying hard to stay hidden, we'll never find
him. If he only wanted to get away to live his own life without being
watched, we have a chance. Oh, and look for wars, of course.
Especially wars that aren't too big... and <I>interesting wars</I>,
know what I mean?'</p>
<p>
'Right. Transmitted.' Normally the drone would have poured scorn on
this bit of amateur psychological sleuthing, but this time it decided
to bite its metaphorical tongue, and relayed Sma's remarks to the
unresponding ship for transmission to the search fleet ahead of
them.</p>
<p>
Sma took a deep breath, shoulders rising and falling. 'Party still
going on?'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said, surprised.</p>
<p>
Sma jumped off the bed and stepped into the Xeny suit. 'Well; let's
not be party poopers.'</p>
<p>
She fastened the suit, scooped up the brown and yellow head and
walked for the door.</p>
<p>
'Sma,' the drone said, following. 'I thought you'd be mad.'</p>
<p>
'Maybe I will be, once the <I>calm</I> wears off,' she admitted,
opening the door and putting the suit head on. 'But just right now, I
really can't be bothered.'</p>
<p>
They went down the corridor. She looked back at the clear-fielded
machine behind her; 'Come on, drone; it's meant to be fancy dress.
But try something a little more imaginative than a warship this
time.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm,' the machine said. 'Any suggestions?'</p>
<p>
'I don't know,' Sma sighed, 'What would suit you? I mean, what is the
perfect role-model for a cowardly lying patronising hypocritical
bastard with no trust in or respect for another person?'</p>
<p>
There was silence from behind as they approached the noise and light
of the party. So she turned round and, instead of the drone, saw a
classically proportioned, handsome, but somehow anonymous-looking
young man following her down the corridor, his gaze just moving up
from her behind to her eyes.</p>
<p>
Sma laughed. 'Yes; very good.' She walked a few more steps. 'On
second thoughts, I think I preferred the warship.'</p>

<p>
He never wrote things in the sand. He resented even leaving
footprints. He saw it as a one-way commerce; he did the
beachcombing, and the sea provided the materials. The sand was the
middle-man, displaying the goods as though it was a long, soggy shop
counter. He liked the simplicity of this arrangement.</p>
<p>
Sometimes he watched the ships passing, far out to sea. Now and again
he'd wish that he was on one of the tiny dark shapes, on his way to
some bright and strange place, or on his way - imagining harder - to
a quiet home port, to twinkling lights, amiable laughter, friends and
welcome. But usually he ignored the slow specks, and got on with his
walking and gathering, and kept his eyes on the grey-brown wash of
the beach's slope. The horizon was clear and far and empty, the wind
sang low in the dunes, and the seabirds wheeled and cried,
comfortingly random and argumentative in the cold skies above.</p>
<p>
The brash, noisy home-cars came sometimes, from the interior. The
home-cars were loaded with shining metal and flashing lights, they
had multi-coloured windows and highly ornamental grilles, they
fluttered with flags and dripped with enthusiastically imagined but
sloppily executed paint-jobs, and they groaned and flexed,
over-loaded, as they came coughing and spluttering and belching fumes
down the sandy track from the parktown. Adults leaned out of windows
or stood one-legged on running boards; children ran alongside, or
clung to the ladders and straps that covered their sides, or sat
squealing and shouting on the roof.</p>
<p>
They came to see the strange man who lived in a funny wooden shack in
the dunes. They were fascinated, if also slightly repelled, by the
strangeness of living in something that was dug into the ground,
something that did not - could not - move. They would stare at the
line where the wood and tar-paper met the sand, and shake their
heads, walking right round the small, skewed hut, as if looking for
the wheels. They talked amongst themselves, trying to imagine what it
must be like to have the same view and the same sort of weather all
the time. They opened the rickety door and sniffed the dark, smoky,
man-scented air inside the hut, and shut the door quickly, declaring
that it must be unhealthy to live in the same place, joined to the
earth. Insects. Rot. Stale air.</p>
<p>
He ignored them. He could understand their language, but he pretended
not to. He knew that the ever-changing population of the parktown
inland called him the tree-man, because they liked to imagine he had
put down roots like his wheel-less shack had. He was usually out when
they came to the shack, anyway. They lost interest in it fairly
quickly, he found; they went to the shore line to shriek when they
got their feet wet, and throw stones at the waves, and build little
cars in the sand; then they climbed back into their home-cars, and
went sputtering and creaking back inland, lights flashing, horns
honking, leaving him alone again.</p>
<p>
He found dead seabirds all the time, and the washed-up carcases of
sea mammals every few days. Beachweed and sea-flowers lay strewn like
party streamers over the sands, and - when they dried - rippled in
the wind and slowly unravelled, finally disintegrating to be blown
out to sea or far inland in bright clouds of colour and decay.</p>
<p>
Once he found a dead sailor, lying washed and bloated by the ocean,
extremities nibbled, one leg moving to the slow foamy beat of the
sea. He stood and looked at the man for a while, then emptied his
canvas bag of its flotsam booty, tore it flat, and gently covered the
man's head and upper torso with it. The tide was ebbing, so he did
not drag the body further up the beach. He walked to the parktown,
for once not pushing his little wooden cart of tide treasure before
him, and told the sheriff there.</p>
<p>
The day he found the little chair he ignored it, but it was still
there when he walked back past that stretch of beach on his return.
He went on, and the next day combed in the other direction towards a
different flat horizon, and thought the gale the following night
would have removed it, but found it there again, the next day, and so
took it, and in his shack repaired it with twine and a new leg made
from a washed-up branch, and put it by the door of the shack, but
never sat in it.</p>
<p>
A woman came to the shack, every five or six days. He'd met her in
parktown, soon after he'd arrived, on the third or fourth day of a
drinking binge. He paid her in the mornings, always more than he
thought she expected, because he knew she was frightened by the
strange, unmoving shack,</p>
<p>
She'd talk to him about her old loves and old hopes and new hopes and
he half listened, knowing she thought he didn't really understand
what she was saying. When he talked it was in another language, and
the story was even less believeable. The woman would lie close to
him, her head on his smooth and unscarred chest, while he talked into
the dark air above the bed, his voice not echoing in the wood-flimsy
space of the shack, and he'd tell her, in words she would never
understand, about the magic land where everyone was a wizard and
nobody ever had terrible choices to make, and guilt was almost
unknown, and poverty and degradation were things you had to teach
children about to let them understand how fortunate they were, and
where no hearts broke.</p>
<p>
He told her about a man, a warrior, who'd worked for the wizard doing
things they could or would not bring themselves to do, and who
eventually could work for them no more, because in the course of some
driven, personal campaign to rid himself of a burden he would not
admit to - and even the wizards had not discovered - he found, in the
end, that he had only added to that weight, and his ability to bear
was not without limit after all.</p>
<p>
And he told her, sometimes, about another time and another place, far
away in space and far away in time and even further away in history,
where four children had played together in a huge and wonderful
garden, but seen their idyll destroyed with gunfire, and of the boy
who became a youth and then a man, but who for ever after carried
more than love for a girl in his heart. Years later, he would tell
her, a small but terrible war was waged in this faraway place, and
the garden itself laid waste. (And, eventually, the man did lose the
girl from his heart.) Finally, when he had almost talked himself to
sleep, and the night was at its darkest, and the girl was long since
gone to the land of dreams, sometimes he would whisper to her about a
great warship, a great metal warship, becalmed in stone but still
dreadful and awful and potent, and about the two sisters who were the
balance of that warship's fate, and about their own fates, and about
the Chair, and the Chairmaker.</p>
<p>
Then he would sleep, and when he woke, each time, the girl and the
money would be gone.</p>
<p>
He would turn back to the dark tar-paper walls then, and seek sleep,
but not find it, and so rise and dress and go out, and comb the
horizon-wide beach again, under the blue skies or the black skies,
beneath the wheeling seabirds screaming their meaningless songs to
the sea and the brine-charged breeze.</p>
<p>
The weather varied, and because he'd never bothered to find out, he
never knew what season it was, but the weather swung between warm and
bright and cold and dull, and sometimes sleet came, chilling him, and
winds blew around the dark hut, keening through the gaps in the
planks and the tar-paper, and stirring the slack disturbances of sand
on the floor inside the shack like abraded memories.</p>
<p>
Sand would build up inside the hut, blown in from one direction or
another, and he would scoop it carefully, throw it out the door to
the wind like an offering, and wait for the next storm.</p>
<p>
He always suspected there was a pattern to these slow sandy
inundations, but he could not bring himself to try to work out what
that pattern was. Anyway, every few days he had to trundle his little
wooden cart into the parktown, and sell his sea-begotten wares, and
collect money, and so food, and so the girl that came to the shack
every five days or six.</p>
<p>
The parktown changed every time he went there, streets being created
or evaporating as the home cars arrived or departed; it all depended
where people chose to park. There were some fairly static landmarks,
like the sheriff's compound and the fuel stockade and the smithy
wagon and the area where the light-engineering caravans set up shop,
but even those changed slowly, and all about them was in constant
flux, so that the geography of the parktown was never the same on two
visits. He drew a secret satisfaction from this inchoate permanence,
and did not hate going there as much as he pretended.</p>
<p>
The track there was rutted and soft, and never got any shorter; he
always hoped the random shiftings of the parktown might slowly draw
its bustle and light closer to him, but it never happened, and he
would console himself with the thought that if the parktown came
closer then so would the people, and their bumbling inquisitiveness.</p>
<p>
There was a girl in the parktown, the daughter of one of the dealers
he traded with, who seemed to care for him more than the others; she
made him drinks and brought him sweetmeats from her father's caravan,
and seldom said anything, but slipped the food to him, and smiled
shyly and walked quickly off again, her pet seabird - flightless,
half of each wing cut off - waddling after her, squawking.</p>
<p>
He said nothing to her that he didn't have to say, and always averted
his eyes from her slim brown shape. He did not know what the courting
laws were in this place, and while accepting the drink and food
always seemed the easiest course, he did not want to intrude any more
than he had to in the lives of these people. He told himself she and
her family would move away soon, and accepted the offerings she
brought him with a nod but no smile or word, and did not always
finish what he was given. He noticed there was a young man who always
seemed to be around whenever the girl served him, and he caught the
boy's eyes a few times, and knew that the youth wanted the girl, and
looked away each time.</p>
<p>
The young man came after him one day when he was on his way back to
the shack within the dunes. The youth walked in front of him and
tried to make him talk; hit him on the shoulder, shouting into his
face. He feigned incomprehension. The young man drew lines in the
sand in front of him which he duly plodded over with his cart and
stood looking, blinking at the youth, both hands still on the handles
of the cart, while the boy shouted louder and drew another line on
the sand between them.</p>
<p>
Eventually, he got fed up with the whole performance, and the next
time the young man prodded his shoulder he took his arm and twisted
it and forced the youth to the sand and held him there for a while,
twisting the arm in its socket just enough - he hoped - to avoid
breaking anything but with sufficient force to disable the fellow for
a minute or two while he took up his cart again and trundled it
slowly away over the dunes.</p>
<p>
It seemed to work.</p>
<p>
Two nights later - the night after the regular woman had come and
he'd told her about the terrible battleship and the two sisters and
the man who was not yet forgiven - the girl came knocking at his
door. The pet seabird with the clipped wings jumped and squawked
outside while the cried and told him she loved him and there'd been
an argument with her father, and he tried to push her away, but she
slipped in underneath his arm and lay weeping on his bed.</p>
<p>
He looked out into the starless night and stared into the eyes of the
crippled, silent bird. Then he went over to the bed, dragged the girl
from it and forced her out of the door, slamming it and bolting it.</p>
<p>
Her cries, and those of the bird, came through the gaps in the planks
for a while, like the seeping sand. He stuck his fingers in his ears
and pulled the grimy covers over his head.</p>
<p>
Her family, the sheriff, and perhaps twenty other people from the
parktown, came for him the next night.</p>
<p>
The girl had been found that evening, battered and raped and dead on
the path from his shack. He stood in the doorway of the hut, looking
out into the torch-lit crowd, met the eyes of the young man who had
wanted the girl, and knew.</p>
<p>
There was nothing he could do, because the guilt in one pair of eyes
was outshone by the vengeance in too many others, and so he slammed
the door and ran, across the shack and straight through the rickety
planks on the far side and out into the dunes and the night.</p>
<p>
He fought five of them that night and nearly killed two, until he
found the young man and one of his friends searching
unenthusiastically for him back near the track.</p>
<p>
He clubbed the friend unconscious, took the young man by the throat.
He gathered up both their knives, and held one blade to the throat of
the youth as he marched him back to the shack.</p>
<p>
He set fire to the shack.</p>
<p>
When the light had attracted a dozen or so of the men, he stood up on
the tallest dune above the hollow, holding the youth with one hand.</p>
<p>
The parktown people gazed up at the stranger, lit by flames. He let
the boy fall to the sand, threw him both knives.</p>
<p>
The boy picked up the knives; charged.</p>
<p>
He moved, let the boy go past, disarmed him. He gathered both knives;
threw them hilt down in the sand in front of the boy. The youth
struck out again, knife in each hand. Again - hardly seeming to move
- he let the youth crash past, and slipped the knives from his grasp.
He tripped the youth, and while he was still lying on the dune's top,
threw the knives, sending them both thudding into the sand a
centimetre on either side of his head. The youth screamed, plucked
both blades out and threw them.</p>
<p>
His head hardly moved as they hissed by his ears. The people watching
in the flame-lit hollow moved their heads, following the trajectory
the knives had to take, to the dunes behind them. But when they
looked back again, wondering, both blades were in the stranger's
hands, plucked from the air. He tossed them to the boy again.</p>
<p>
The youth caught them, screamed, fumbled blood-handed to get them the
right way round, and rushed again at the stranger, who dropped him,
whacked the knives from his hands, and for a long moment held one of
the young man's elbows poised over his knee, arm raised, ready to
break... then shoved the boy away. He picked up the knives again,
placed them in the open palms of the youth.</p>
<p>
He listened to the boy sobbing into the dark sand, while the people
watched.</p>
<p>
He got ready to run again, glancing behind him.</p>
<p>
The crippled seabird hopped and fluttered, clipped wings beating on
air and sand, to the top of the dune. It cocked one flame-bright eye
at the stranger.</p>
<p>
The people in the hollow seemed frozen by the dancing flames.</p>
<p>
The bird waddled to the prone, sobbing figure of the boy on the sand,
and screamed. It flapped, shrieked, and stabbed at the boy's eyes.</p>
<p>
The boy tried to fend it off, but the bird leapt into the air and
whooped and beat and feathers flew and when the boy broke one of its
wings and it fell to the sand, facing away from him, it jetted liquid
shit at him.</p>
<p>
The boy's face fell back to the sand. His body shook with sobs.</p>
<p>
The stranger watched the eyes of the people in the hollow, while his
shack caved in and the orange sparks swirled up into the still night
sky.</p>
<p>
Eventually the sheriff and the girl's father came and took the boy
away, and a moon later the girl's family left, and two moons later
the tightly bound body of the young man was lowered into a freshly
picked hole in the nearest outcrop of rock, and covered with stones.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The people in the parktown would not talk to him, though one trader
still took his flotsam. The brash and noisy home cars stopped coming
down the sandy track. He had not thought he would miss them. He
pitched a small tent near the blackened remains of the shack.</p>
<p>
The woman stopped coming to him; he never saw her again. He told
himself he was getting so little for his haul that he could not have
paid her and eaten as well.</p>
<p>
The worst thing, he found, was that there was nobody to talk to.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He saw the seated figure on the beach, way in the distance, five
moons or so after the night he'd burned his shack. He hesitated,
then went on.</p>
<p>
Twenty metres from the woman, he stopped and carefully inspected a
length of fishing net on the tideline, the floats still attached and
gleaming like earth-bound suns in the low morning light.</p>
<p>
He glanced at the woman. She was sitting, legs crossed, arms folded
across her lap, staring out to sea. Her simple gown was the colour of
the sky.</p>
<p>
He went up to the woman and put his new canvas bag down at her side.
She did not move.</p>
<p>
He sat beside her, arranged his limbs similarly, and stared out to
sea, like her.</p>
<p>
After a hundred or so waves had approached and broken and slipped
away again, he cleared his throat.</p>
<p>
'A few times,' he said, 'I had the feeling I was being watched.'</p>
<p>
Sma said nothing for a while. The seabirds pivoted inside the spaces
of the air, calling in a language he still did not understand.</p>
<p>
'Oh, people have always felt that,' Sma said, at last.</p>
<p>
He smoothed away a wormcast in the sand. 'I don't belong to you
Diziet.'</p>
<p>
'No,' she said, turning to him. 'You're right. You don't belong to
us. All we can do is ask.'</p>
<p>
'What?'</p>
<p>
'That you come back. We have a job for you.'</p>
<p>
'What is it?'</p>
<p>
'Oh...' Sma smoothed her gown over her knees. 'Helping to drag a
bunch of aristos into the next millenium, from the inside.'</p>
<p>
'Why?'</p>
<p>
'It's important.'</p>
<p>
'Isn't everything?'</p>
<p>
'And we can pay you properly this time.'</p>
<p>
'You paid me off very handsomely the last time. Lots of money and a
new body. What more can a chap ask for?' He gestured at the canvas
bag at her side, and at himself, clothed in salt-stained rags. 'Don't
let this fool you. I haven't lost the loot. I'm a rich man; very
rich, here.' He watched the waves roll up towards them, then break
and foam and fall away again. 'I just wanted the simple life, for a
while.' He gave a sort of half-laugh, and realised it was the first
time he'd even started to laugh since he'd come here.</p>
<p>
'I know,' Sma said. 'But this is different. Like I said; we can pay
you properly, now.'</p>
<p>
He looked at her. 'Enough. No more being cryptic. What do you mean?'</p>
<p>
She turned her gaze to him. He had to work hard at not looking away.</p>
<p>
'We've found Livueta,' she said.</p>
<p>
He stared into her eyes for a time, and then blinked and looked away.
He cleared his throat, looking back out to the glittering sea, and
had to sniff and wipe his eyes. Sma watched as the man moved one hand
slowly to his chest, not realising he was doing it, and rubbed at the
skin there, just over his heart.</p>
<p>
'Mm-hmm. You're sure?'</p>
<p>
'Yes, we're sure.'</p>
<p>
He looked out over the waves after that, and suddenly felt that they
were no longer bringing things to him, no longer messengers from the
distant storms offering their bounty, but instead had become a
pathway; a route, another distant sort of opportunity, beckoning.</p>
<p>
That simple? he thought to himself. A word - a single name - from Sma
and I'm all ready to go, take off, and take up their arms again?
Because of <I>her</I>?</p>
<p>
He let a few more waves roll up and down. The seabirds wailed. Then
he sighed. 'All right,' he said. He pushed one hand up through his
tangled, matted hair. 'Tell me about it.'</p>
<p>

<p>
'The fact remains,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw insisted, 'that the last time we
went through this rigmarole, Zakalwe fucked up. They froze his ass in
that Winter Palace.'</p>
<p>
'All right,' Sma said. 'But it wasn't like him. Okay, so one time he
gets it wrong... we don't know why. So maybe now he's had time to get
over it, he'll actually want a chance to show he can still do the
business. Maybe he can't wait for us to find him.'</p>
<p>
'Good grief,' sighed the drone. 'Wishful thinking from Sma the
Cynical. Maybe you're starting to lose your touch too.'</p>
<p>
'Oh shut up.'</p>
<p>
She watched the planet swing towards them on the module screen.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Twenty-nine days had passed on the <I>Xenophobe.</I></p>
<p>
As an ice breaker, the fancy-dress party had been a crushing success.
Sma had woken up in a cushion-filled alcove of the rec area,
birth-naked and in a tangle of assorted equally nude limbs and
torsos. She had extricated one arm carefully from under the
voluptuous sleeping form of Jetart Hrine, stood shakily, and gazed
round the softly breathing bodies, appraising the men in particular,
and then - treading very carefully, nearly over-balancing several
times on the plump cushions, her muscles all complaining and trembly
- tip-toed her way between the slumbering crew to the welcome
solidity of the red-wood floor. The rest of the area had already been
tidied. The ship must have sorted out everybody's clothes, for they
lay in neat piles on a couple of large tables, just outside the
alcove.</p>
<p>
Sma massaged her slightly tingling genitals, grimacing. Bending over,
they looked quite pink and raw; things looked slippery, and she
decided she needed a bath.</p>
<p>
The drone met her at the entrance to the corridor. Its red glowing
field looked at least partially like a comment. 'Good night's sleep?'
it inquired. 'Don't start that again.'</p>
<p>
The drone floated at her shoulder as she headed for the elevator.</p>
<p>
'You've made friends with the crew, then.'</p>
<p>
She nodded. 'Very good friends with all of them, by the feel of it.
Where's the ship's pool?'</p>
<p>
'Floor above the hangar,' the machine said, following her into the
elevator.</p>
<p>
'Record anything exciting last night?' Sma asked, leaning back
against the elevator wall as they dropped.</p>
<p>
'Sma,' exclaimed the drone. 'I would not be so ungallant!'</p>
<p>
'Hmm.' She raised one eyebrow. The elevator stopped, door opening.
'What <I>memories</I>, though,' the drone said, breathily. 'Your
appetite and stamina are a credit to your species. I think.'</p>
<p>
Sma dived into the smaller whirlpool, and, on surfacing, spat a jet
of water at the machine, which dodged and backed into the elevator.
'I'll just leave you to it, then. Judging from last night, even an
innocent offensive-model drone isn't safe from you once you get the
bit between your teeth. So to speak.'</p>
<p>
Sma splashed at it. 'Get out of here, you prurient pisspot.'</p>
<p>
'And sweet-talking won't work ei...' the drone said, as the elevator
door closed.</p>
<p>
She would not have been surprised if the atmosphere in the ship had
been a little embarrassed for a day or two thereafter, but the crew
seemed quite cool about it all, and she decided that, basically, they
were good sports. Happily, the fad for having colds passed quickly.
She settled down to studying Voerenhutz, trying to guess where in the
interlinked civilisations they were heading for Zakalwe might be...
and enjoying herself, though - in the case of the latter activity -
not on anything like the same scale or with quite the same frenetic
abandon as she obviously had on her first night aboard.</p>
<p>
Ten days out, the <I>Just Testing</I> sent news that Gainly had been
delivered of twins; mother and pups doing well. Sma prepared a signal
that her stand-in was to give the hralz a big kiss, from her, then
hesitated, realising that the machine that was impersonating her
would doubtless already have done so. She felt bad, and in the end
just sent a formal acknowledgement.</p>
<p>
She kept up on recent developments in Voerenhutz; the latest Contact
forecasts were getting gloomier all the time. The brush-fire
conflicts on a dozen planets each threatened to ignite a full-scale
war, and - while getting a direct answer was proving difficult - she
formed the impression that even if they found and convinced Zakalwe
almost as soon as they landed, and hauled his ass out on the
<I>Xenophobe</I> with the ship pushing its design limits, the chances
of getting him to Voerenhutz in time to make any difference were at
best fifty-fifty.</p>
<p>
'Holy shit,' the drone said one day, as she sat in her cabin,
reviewing cautiously optimistic reports on the peace conference back
home (for so she had started to think of it, she admitted to
herself).</p>
<p>
'What?' She turned to the machine.</p>
<p>
It looked at her. 'They just changed the course schedule for the <I>What
Are The Civilian Applications</I>?'</p>
<p>
Sma waited.</p>
<p>
'That's a Continent class GSV,' the drone said. 'Sub-class Prompt,
one of the limiteds.'</p>
<p>
'You said it was a General; now it's a Limited; make up your mind.'</p>
<p>
'No, I mean it's a limited edition; the go-faster model; even nippier
than this beast, once it gets going,' the drone said. It floated
closer to her, fields set a weird mixture of olive and purple, which
she seemed to remember indicated Awe. She'd certainly never seen <I>that</I>
expression on Skaffen-Amtiskaw before. 'It's heading for Crastalier,'
it told her.</p>
<p>
'For us? For Zakalwe?' she frowned.</p>
<p>
'Nobody'll say, but it looks like it to me. A whole General Systems
Vehicle, just for us. Wow!'</p>
<p>
'Wow,' Sma mimicked sourly, and pressed the screen for the view
forward of the <I>Xenophobe</I>, still charging through the star
systems for Crastalier. In their false representation on the screen,
the stars ahead blazed blue-white, and - at the right magnification -
the overall structure of the Open Cluster was easily visible.</p>
<p>
She shook her head, went back to the peace conference reports.
'Zakalwe, you asshole,' she muttered to herself, 'you'd better
fucking show up soon.'</p>
<p>
Five days later, and still five days away, the General Contact Unit
<I>Very Little Gravitas Indeed</I> signalled from the depths of the
Open Cluster Crastalier that it thought it had picked up Zakalwe's
trail.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The blue-white globe filled the screen; the module dipped its nose,
plunging into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>
'I just get the feeling this is going to be a complete debacle,' the
drone said.</p>
<p>
'Yes,' Sma said, 'but you're not in charge.'</p>
<p>
'I'm serious,' the machine told her. 'Zakalwe's lost it. He doesn't
want to be found, he won't be talked round, and even if by some
miracle he can be, he can't do the same thing with Beychae. The man's
washed up.'</p>
<p>
Sma had a sudden, strange flash of memory then, back to the
horizon-wide beach, and the man who'd sat at her side for a while,
watching the wide ocean roll its waves up and down the glistening
slope of sand.</p>
<p>
She shook herself out of it. 'He's still together enough to junk a
knife missile,' she told the machine, watching the hazy,
cloud-shadowed ocean scroll beneath the dropping module. They were
approaching the cloud tops.</p>
<p>
'That was for him. For us, it'll be another Winter Palace job; I can
feel it.'</p>
<p>
She shook her head, apparently hypnotised by the view of cloud and
curving ocean. 'I don't know what happened there. He got into that
siege and just wouldn't break out. We warned him; we <I>told</I> him,
in the end, but he just wouldn't... couldn't do it. I don't know what
happened to him, I really don't; he just wasn't himself.'</p>
<p>
'Well, he lost his head on Fohls. Maybe he lost more than that.
Perhaps he lost it all on Fohls. Maybe we didn't quite save him in
time.'</p>
<p>
'We got to him in time,' Sma said, remembering Fohls as well now, as
they plunged into a bulging cloud-top and the screen went grey. She
didn't bother to adjust the wavelength, apparently content to look at
the glowing, featureless interior of the cumulus.</p>
<p>
'It was still traumatic,' the drone said.</p>
<p>
'I'm sure, but...' she shrugged. The view of ocean and clouds burst
clear onto the screen again, and the module angled steeper, powering
down towards the waves. The sea flashed up towards them; Sma turned
the screen off. She looked bashfully at Skaffen-Amtiskaw. 'I never
like watching that,' she confessed. The drone said nothing. Inside
the module, all was peace and quiet. After a moment, she asked, 'We
in yet?'</p>
<p>
'Doing our submarine impression,' the drone said crisply. 'Landfall
in fifteen minutes.'</p>
<p>
She turned the screen back on, got it to adjust for a sonic display,
and watched the rolling sea floor speed by beneath. The module was
manoeuvring hard, swinging and diving and zooming all the time,
avoiding sea creatures as it followed the slowly rising slope of
continental shelf towards the land. The view on the screen was
disconcerting; she switched it off again, turned to the drone.</p>
<p>
'He'll be all right, and he'll come with us; we still know where that
woman is.'</p>
<p>
'Livueta the Contemptuous?' sneered the drone. 'Short shrift she gave
him last time. She'd have blown his head off if I hadn't been there.
Why the hell should Zakalwe want to meet her again?'</p>
<p>
'I don't know,' Sma frowned. 'He won't say, and Contact hasn't got
round to doing the full procedure on the place we think he came from.
I think it must involve something from his past... something he did,
once, before we ever heard of him. I don't know. I think he loves
her, or did, and still thinks he does... or just wants...'</p>
<p>
'What? Wants what? Go on; you tell me.'</p>
<p>
'Forgiveness?'</p>
<p>
'Sma, given all the things Zakalwe's done, just since we've known
him, they'd have to invent a personal deity for him alone, to even
start <I>forgiving </I>him.'</p>
<p>
Sma turned away to look at the blank screen again. She shook her head
and said quietly, 'It doesn't work that way, Skaffen-Amtiskaw.'</p>
<p>
Or any other way, the drone thought to itself, but didn't say
anything.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The module surfaced in a deserted dock in the middle of the city,
amongst the flotsam and jetsam. It roughed the texture of its
outermost fields, so that the oily scum on the surface of the water
stuck to it.</p>
<p>
Sma watched its top hatch close, and stepped off the back of the
drone, onto the pitted concrete of the dock. The module was
ninety-per cent submerged; it looked like some flat-bottomed boat
turned turtle. She straightened the rather vulgar culottes which
were, regrettably, the height of fashion here just now, and looked up
and around at the crumbling empty warehouses which all but enclosed
the quiet dock. The city - she was oddly gratified to find - grumbled
beyond.</p>
<p>
'What was that you were saying about not looking in cities?'
Skaffen-Amtiskaw inquired.</p>
<p>
'Don't be crass,' she said, then clapped her hands and rubbed them.
Looking down at the drone, she grinned. 'Anyway: time to start
thinking like a suitcase, old chum. Make with a handle.'</p>
<p>
'I hope you realise I find this every bit as demeaning as you think I
must,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said, with quiet dignity, then extended a
soligram handle from one side, and flipped over. Sma gripped the
handle and strained at it.</p>
<p>
'An <I>empty</I> suitcase, asshole,' she grunted.</p>
<p>
'Oh, pardon me, I'm sure,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw muttered, and went light.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Sma opened a wallet full of money displaced only hours earlier from a
city-centre bank by the good ship <I>Xenophobe</I>, and paid the cab
driver. She watched a line of troop carriers thunder past, heading
down the boulevard, then sat on a bench which formed part of a stone
wall bordering a narrow strip of trees and grass, and looked out over
the broad sidewalk and the boulevard beyond, to the large and
impressive stone building on the far side. She place the drone beside
her. Traffic roared past; people hurried to and fro in front of her.</p>
<p>
At least, she thought, they're fairly Standard. She had never liked
being altered to impersonate the natives. Anyway; they had
inter-system travel here, and were fairly used to seeing people who
looked different, even alien on occasion. As usual, of course, she
was very tall in comparison, but she could live with a few stares.</p>
<p>
'He's still in there?' she said quietly, looking at the armed guards
outside the Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>
'Discussing some sort of weird trust set-up with the top brass,' the
drone whispered. 'Want to eavesdrop?'</p>
<p>
'Hmm. No.'</p>
<p>
They had a bug in the appropriate conference chamber; literally a fly
on the wall.</p>
<p>
'Wa!' the drone yelped. 'I don't believe this man!'</p>
<p>
Sma glanced at the drone, despite herself. She frowned. 'What's he
said?'</p>
<p>
'Not that!' the drone gasped. 'The <I>Very Little Gravitas Indeed</I>
just worked out what the maniac's been up to here.'</p>
<p>
The GCU was still in orbit, providing back-up for the <I>Xenophobe;</I>
its Contact procedures and equipment had provided and were providing
most of the information about the place; its bug was monitoring the
conference chamber. Meanwhile, it was scanning computers and
information banks over the entire planet.</p>
<p>
'Well?' Sma said, watching another troop carrier rumble past on the
boulevard.</p>
<p>
'The man's insane. Power mad!' the drone muttered, seemingly to
itself. 'Forget Voerenhutz; we have to get him out of here for the
sake of <I>these</I> people.'</p>
<p>
Sma elbowed the suitcase-drone. '<I>What</I>, dammit?'</p>
<p>
'Okay; here, Zakalwe's a goddamn magnate, right? Mega-powerful;
interests everywhere; initial stake what he brought with him from the
place he junked the knife missile; the loot we gave him last time,
plus profits. And what is the core of his business empire, here?
Genetechnology.'</p>
<p>
Sma thought for a moment. 'Oh-oh,' she said, sitting back on the
bench, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>
'Whatever you're imagining, it's worse. Sma; there are five rather
elderly autocrats on this planet, in competing hegemonies. <I>They
are all getting healthier.</I> They are all getting, in fact,
younger. That oughtn't to be possible for another twenty, thirty
years.'</p>
<p>
Sma said nothing. There was a funny feeling in her belly.</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe's corporation,' the drone said quickly, 'is receiving crazy
money from each of those five people. It <I>was</I> on the take from
a sixth geezer, but he died about one-twenty days ago; assassinated.
The Ethnarch Kerian. He controlled the other half of this continent.
It's his demise that has led to all this military activity. Also,
with the exception of the Ethnarch Kerian, these suddenly rejuvenated
autocrats were showing signs of becoming uncharacteristically <I>benign</I>,
from about the time they started getting so suspiciously frisky.'</p>
<p>
Sma closed her eyes for a moment, opened them. 'Is it working?' she
said, through a dry mouth.</p>
<p>
'Like hell; they're all under threat from coups; their own military,
as a rule. Worse than that, Kerian's death lit a slow fuse. This
whole place is going super-critical! And we are talking tootsies on
the event horizon; these meatbrained loonies have thermonukes. He's
crazy!' the drone suddenly screeched. Sma hissed to quiet it, even
though she knew the drone would be sound-fielding its words so that
only she could hear. The drone spluttered on: 'He must have cracked
the gene-coding in his own cells; the steady-state retro-ageing that
<I>we gave him;</I> he's been selling it! For money and favours,
trying to get these monomaniac dictators to behave like nice people.
Sma! He's trying to set up his own contact section! And he's fucking
it! Completely!'</p>
<p>
She whacked the machine with one fist. 'Calm down, dammit.'</p>
<p>
'Sma,' the drone said, voice almost languid, 'I am calm. I'm just
trying to communicate to you the enormity of the planetary cock-up
Zakalwe has managed to concoct here. The <I>Very Little Gravitas
Indeed</I> has blown a fuse; even as we talk, Contact Minds in an
ever-expanding sphere centred right here are clearing their
intellectual decks and trying to work out what the hell to do to tidy
this stunningly ghastly mess. If that GSV hadn't been on its way here
anyway, they'd have diverted it because of this. An asteroid
belt-sized pile of shit is about to hit a fan exactly the size of
this planet, thanks to Zakalwe's ludicrous good-guy schemes, and
Contact is going to have to try and field all of it.' It hesitated.
'Yeah; I just got the word.' It sounded relieved. 'You have a day to
haul Zakalwe's loop-eyed ass out of here, otherwise we snatch him;
emergency displace, no holds barred.'</p>
<p>
Sma took a very deep breath. 'Apart from that... everything all
right?'</p>
<p>
'This, Ms Sma, is no time for levity,' the drone said, soberly. Then;
'Shit!'</p>
<p>
'What now?'</p>
<p>
'Meeting's over, but Zakalwe the Insane isn't taking his car; he's
heading for the elevator down to the tube system. Destination...
naval base. There's a submarine waiting for him.'</p>
<p>
Sma stood. 'Submarine, eh?' She smoothed the culottes. 'Back to the
docks, agree?'</p>
<p>
'Agreed.'</p>
<p>
She hefted the drone, started walking, looking for a cab. 'I've asked
the <I>Very Little Gravitas Indeed</I> to fake a radio message,'
Skaffen-Amtiskaw told her. 'A cab should pull up here momentarily.'</p>
<p>
'And they say there's never one around when you need one.'</p>
<p>
'You're worrying me, Sma. You're taking all this far too calmly.'</p>
<p>
'Oh, I'll panic later.' Sma took a deep breath and let it out slowly.
'Could that be the cab?'</p>
<p>
'I believe it is.'</p>
<p>
'What's &quot;To the docks&quot;?'</p>
<p>
The drone told her, and she said it. The cab sped off through the
largely military traffic.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Six hours later they were still following the submarine, as it whined
and whirred and gurgled its way through the layers of ocean, heading
for the equatorial sea.</p>
<p>
'Sixty klicks an hour,' fumed the drone. 'Sixty klicks an hour!'</p>
<p>
'To them it's fast; don't be so unsympathetic to your fellow
machines.' Sma watched the screen as the vessel a kilometre in front
of them burrowed its way through the ocean. The abyssal plain was
kilometres below.</p>
<p>
'It isn't one of us, Sma,' the drone said wearily. 'It's just a
submarine; the smartest thing inside it is the human captain. I rest
my case.'</p>
<p>
'Any idea where it's heading yet?'</p>
<p>
'No. The captain's orders are to take Zakalwe wherever he wants to
go, and after giving him this general heading, Zakalwe's kept quiet.
There's a whole heap of islands and atolls he could be making for, or
- several days travel away at this crawl - thousands of kilometres of
coastline, on another continent.'</p>
<p>
'Check out the islands, and that coastline. There must be a reason
he's heading this way.'</p>
<p>
'It's <I>being</I> checked out!' the drone snapped.</p>
<p>
Sma looked at it. Skaffen-Amtiskaw flashed a delicate shade of
purple, intimating contrition. 'Sma; this... man... totally blew it
the last time; we're five or six million down on that last job, all
because he wouldn't break out of the Winter Palace and balance things
out. I could show you scenes of the terror there that would blanch
your hair. Now he's come very close indeed to instigating a global
catastrophe here. Since the guy suffered what happened to him on
Fohls - since he started trying to be a good guy in his own right -
he's been a disaster. If we do get him, and can get him to
Voerenhutz, I just worry what sort of chaos he'll engender there. The
man's bad news. Never mind outing Beychae; offing Zakalwe would be
doing everybody a favour.'</p>
<p>
Sma looked into the centre of the drone's sensory band. 'One;' she
said, 'don't talk about human lives as though they're just
collateral.' She breathed deeply. 'Two; remember the massacre, in the
courtyard of that inn?' she asked calmly. 'The guys through the
walls, and your knife missile let off the leash?'</p>
<p>
'One; sorry to have offended your mammalian sensibilities. Two; Sma,
will you ever let me forget it?'</p>
<p>
'Remember what I said would happen if you ever tried anything like
that again?'</p>
<p>
'Sma,' the drone said tiredly, 'if you are seriously trying to imply
that I might kill Zakalwe, all I can say is; don't be ridiculous.'</p>
<p>
'Just remember.' She watched the slowly scrolling screen. 'We have
our orders.'</p>
<p>
'Agreed on courses of action, Sma. We don't have orders, remember?'</p>
<p>
Sma nodded. 'We have our agreed on courses of action. We lift Mr
Zakalwe and take him to Voerenhutz. If at any stage you disagree, you
can always butt out. I'll be given another offensive drone.'</p>
<p>
Skaffen-Amtiskaw was silent for a second, then said, 'Sma, that is
probably the most hurtful thing you have ever said to me - which is
saying a lot - but I'll ignore it, I think, because we are both under
a lot of stress at the moment. Let my actions speak. As you say; we
lift the planetfucker and drop him in Voerenhutz. Though, if this
voyage goes on too much longer, it'll all be taken out of our hands -
or fields, as the case may be - and Zakalwe will wake up on <I>Xenophobe</I>
or the GCU, wondering what happened. All we can do is wait and see.'</p>
<p>
The drone paused then. 'Looks like it could be those equatorial
islands we're heading for,' it told her. 'Zakalwe owns half of them.'</p>
<p>
Sma nodded silently, watching the distant submarine creep through the
ocean. She scratched at her lower abdomen after a while, and turned
to the drone. 'You sure you didn't record anything from that, umm,
sort of orgy, first night on the <I>Xenophobe</I>?</p>
<p>
'Positive.'</p>
<p>
She frowned back at the screen. 'Huh. Pity.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The submarine spent nine hours underwater, then surfaced near an
atoll; an inflatable went ashore. Sma and the drone watched the
single figure walk up the golden, sunlit beach towards a complex of
low buildings; an exclusive hotel for the ruling class of the country
he'd left.</p>
<p>
'What's Zakalwe doing?' Sma said, after he'd been ashore for ten
minutes or so. The submarine had dived again as soon as it recovered
its inflatable, and taken a course back to the port it had departed
from.</p>
<p>
'He's saying goodbye to a girl,' sighed the drone.</p>
<p>
'Is that <I>it</I>?'</p>
<p>
'That would appear to be the only thing to draw him here.'</p>
<p>
'Shit! Couldn't he have taken a plane?'</p>
<p>
'Hmm. No; no airstrip, but anyway, this is a fairly sensitive
demilitarised zone; no unexpected flights of any sort allowed, and
the next seaplane isn't for a couple of days. The sub was actually
the fastest way of...'</p>
<p>
The drone fell silent.</p>
<p>
'Skaffen-Amtiskaw?' Sma said.</p>
<p>
'Well,' the drone said slowly, 'the doxy just smashed a lot of
ornaments and a couple of pieces of very valuable furniture, and then
ran off and buried herself in her bed, weeping... but apart from
that, Zakalwe just sat down in the middle of the lounge with a large
drink and said (and I quote), &quot;Okay; if that's you, Sma, come
and talk to me.&quot;'</p>
<p>
Sma looked at the view on the screen. It showed the small atoll, the
central island lying green and squashed looking between the vibrant
blues and greens of ocean and sky.</p>
<p>
'You know,' she said, 'I think I would like to kill Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
'There's a queue. Surface?'</p>
<p>
'Surface. Let's go see the asshole.'</p>

<p>
Light. Some light. Not very much. Air foul and everywhere pain. He
wanted to scream and writhe, but could find no breath and make
nothing move. A dark destroying shadow welled up inside him,
exterminating thought, and he lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Light. Some light. Not very much. He knew there was pain, too, but
somehow it did not seem so important. He was looking at it
differently now. That was all you had to do; just think about it
differently. He wondered where that idea had come from, and seemed to
remember he'd been taught how to do this.</p>
<p>
Everything was metaphor; all things were something other than
themselves. The pain, for example, was an ocean, and he was adrift on
it. His body was a city and his mind a citadel. All communications
between the two seemed to have been cut, but within the keep that was
his mind he still had power. The part of his consciousness that was
telling him the pain did not hurt, and that all things were like
other things, was like... like... he found it hard to think of a
comparison. A magic mirror, maybe.</p>
<p>
Still thinking about that, the light faded, and he slipped away
again, into the darkness.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Light. Some light (he'd been here before, hadn't he?). Not very much.
He seemed to have left the keep that was his mind, and now he was in
a storm-struck leaking boat, images dancing before him.</p>
<p>
The light grew slowly in strength until it was almost painful. He
felt suddenly terrified, because it seemed to him that he really was
on a tiny creaking leaking boat, tossed scudding across a seething
black ocean, in the teeth of a howling gale, but now there was light,
and it appeared to come from somewhere above him, but when he tried
to look at his hand, or the tiny boat, he still couldn't see
anything. The light shone into his eyes, but it failed to illuminate
anything else. The idea terrified him; the tiny boat was swamped by
a wave and he was submerged again in the ocean of pain, burning
through every pore of his body. Somewhere, thankfully, somebody threw
a switch, and he slipped underneath to darkness, silence and... no
pain.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Light. Some light. He remembered this. The light showed a small boat
assaulted by waves on a broad dark ocean. Beyond, unreachable for
now, there was a great citadel on a small island. And there was
sound. Sound... That was new. Been here before, but not with sound.
He tried to listen, very hard, but could not make out the words.
Still, he formed the impression that maybe somebody was asking
questions.</p>
<p>
Somebody was asking questions... Who...? He waited for a reply, from
outside or from within himself, but nothing came from anywhere; he
felt lost and abandoned, and the worst of it was that he felt
abandoned by himself.</p>
<p>
He decided to ask himself some questions. What was the citadel? That
was his mind. The citadel was supposed to come with a city attached,
which was his body, but it looked like something else had taken over
the city, and there was just the castle, just the keep left. What was
the boat, and the ocean? The ocean was pain. He was in the boat now,
but before that he'd been in the ocean, up to his neck, waves
breaking over him. The boat was... some learned technique which was
protecting him from the pain, not letting him forget it was there,
but keeping its debilitating effects away from him, letting him
think.</p>
<p>
So far so good, he thought. Now, what is the light?</p>
<p>
He might have to come back to that one. Same with: What is the sound?</p>
<p>
He tried another question: Where is this happening?</p>
<p>
He searched his sodden clothes but found nothing in any of the
pockets. He looked for a name tag that he felt ought to be sewn on to
his collar, but it seemed to have been ripped off. He searched the
small boat, but still found no answers. So he tried to imagine being
in the distant keep over the towering waves, and visualised himself
walking into a cavernous store room of jumble and nonsense and
memories buried deep in the castle... but could see nothing in
detail. His eyes closed and he wept with frustration, while the small
boat juddered and tipped underneath him.</p>
<p>
When he opened his eyes, he was holding a little clip of paper with
the word FOHLS printed on it. He was so surprised he let the slip of
paper go; the wind whipped it away into the dark sky over the black
waves. But he had remembered. Fohls was the answer. The planet of
Fohls.</p>
<p>
He felt relieved, and a little proud. He'd discovered something.</p>
<p>
What was he doing here?</p>
<p>
Funeral. He seemed to remember something about a funeral. Surely it
had not been his own.</p>
<p>
Was he dead? He thought about this question for a while. He supposed
it was possible. Maybe there was an afterlife, after all. Well, if
there was life after death, that would teach him. Was this sea of
pain a divine punishment? Was the light a god? He dipped his hand
over the side of the boat, into the pain; it filled him, and he
withdrew. Cruel god if that really was the case. What about all the
stuff I did for the Culture? he wanted to ask. Doesn't that cancel
some of the bad out? Or were those smug self-satisfied bastards wrong
all along? <I>God</I>, he'd love to be able to go back and tell them.
Imagine the look on Sma's face!</p>
<p>
But he didn't think he was dead. It hadn't been his funeral. He could
remember the flat-topped tower by the cliffs looking out over the
sea, and helping to carry some old warrior's body there. Yes,
somebody had died and they were being ceremonially disposed of.</p>
<p>
Something was nagging at him.</p>
<p>
Suddenly he clutched at the boat's rotten timbers and stared out over
the heaving ocean.</p>
<p>
There was a ship. Every now and again he could see a ship, far in the
distance. Barely more than a dot, and mostly the waves were in the
way, but it was a ship. A hole seemed to open somewhere inside him;
his guts fell through it.</p>
<p>
He thought he recognised the ship.</p>
<p>
Then the boat split apart, and he dropped through it, through the
water underneath, then splashed out of the underside of the water,
into air again, and saw the ocean beneath him, and a tiny speck of
its surface, which he was falling towards. It was another small boat;
he crashed through it, through more water, through more air, through
the wreckage of a boat, through another layer of water and another
level of air...</p>
<p>
Hey - one part of his mind thought, as he fell - this is like how Sma
described the Reality... splashed through more waves, through the
water, out into air, heading for more waves...</p>
<p>
This wasn't going to stop. He remembered that the Reality Sma had
described was expanding all the time; you could fall through forever;
really forever, not until the end of the universe; literally forever.</p>
<p>
That won't do, he thought to himself. He'd have to face the ship.</p>
<p>
He landed in a little creaking, leaking boat.</p>
<p>
The ship was much closer now. The ship was huge and dark and bristled
with guns and it was heading straight for him, bow wave a huge white
V of foam bisected by its stem.</p>
<p>
Shit, he wasn't going to be able to get away from it. The cruel
curves of the bows raced slicing towards him. He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>
Once upon a time there was... a ship. A great ship. A ship for
destroying things with; other ships, people, cities... It was very
big and it was designed to kill people and to keep people inside it
from being killed.</p>
<p>
He tried not to remember what the great ship was called. Instead he
saw the ship somehow installed near the middle of a city, and felt
confused, and could not work out how it got there. The ship started
to look like a castle, for some reason, and that did, and did not,
make sense. He began to feel frightened. The ship's name was like
some huge sea creature, bumping into the hull of his boat; like a
battering-ram thudding into the walls of the castle keep. He tried to
block it out, knowing it was just a name but not wanting to hear it
because it always made him feel bad.</p>
<p>
He put his hands over his ears. That worked for a moment. But then
the ship, set in stone, near the centre of the battered city, fired
its great guns, gouting black and flashing yellow-white, and he knew
what was coming, and tried to scream to cover the noise, but when it
arrived it was the name of the ship that the guns had spoken, and it
shattered the boat, demolished the castle, and resounded through the
bones and spaces of his skull, like the laughter of an insane god,
forever.</p>
<p>
The light went out then, and he sank gratefully away from the awful,
accusing sound.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Light. <I>Staberinde</I> said a calm voice from somewhere inside.
<I>Staberinde. It's only a word.</I></p>
<p>
The Staberinde. The ship. He turned away from the light, back into
the darkness.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Light. Sounds, too; a voice. What was I thinking about, earlier? (He
recalled something about a name, but ignored that.) Funeral. Pains.
And the ship. There was a ship. Or there had been. Maybe still is,
for all... but there was something about a funeral. The funeral is
why you are here. That was what confused you before. You thought you
were dead, in fact you were only living. He remembered something
about boats and oceans and castles and cities, but could not actually
see them any more.</p>
<p>
Now, from somewhere, comes touch, touch coming in from out there. Not
pain but touch. Two different things...</p>
<p>
The touch, again. It feels like the touch of a hand; a hand touching
his face, causing more pain, but still a touch, and distinguishably a
hand. His face felt terrible. He must look terrible.</p>
<p>
Where am I again? Crash. Funeral. Fohls.</p>
<p>
Crash. Of course; my name is...</p>
<p>
Too hard.</p>
<p>
What do I do, then?</p>
<p>
That's easier. You are a paid agent of the most advanced - well,
certainly the most <I>energetic -</I> humanoid civilisation in the...
Reality? (No.) Universe? (No.) Galaxy? Yes, galaxy... and you were
representing them at a... a... funeral, and you were coming back on
some stupid <I>aircraft</I> to be picked up and taken away from all
this, when something happened on board the aircraft and it went...
and he'd seen flames and... and there had been that old jungle
floating right... then nothing and pain, and nothing but pain. Then
drifting and floating in and out of it.</p>
<p>
The hand touched his face again. And this time there was something to
see. He thought it looked like a cloud, or like a moon through a
cloud, itself unseen but shining through.</p>
<p>
Possibly the two were connected, he thought. Yes; here it comes
again, and yes, there we are; sensation, feeling; the hand on the
face again. Throat, swallowing, water or some liquid. You are being
given something to drink. From the way it goes down there seems to
be... yes, upright, we are upright, not on our back. The hands, own
hands, they are... an open feeling, feeling very open, very
vulnerable, naked.</p>
<p>
Thinking about his body was bringing the pain back again. He decided
to give up on that. Try something else.</p>
<p>
Try the crash again. Back from the funeral and the desert coming
right up... no, mountains. Or was it jungle? He couldn't remember.
Where are we? Jungle, no... desert, no... what then? Don't know.</p>
<p>
Asleep, he thought suddenly; you were asleep in the aircraft in the
night, and had just enough time to wake up in the darkness and see
flames and begin to realise before light detonated inside your head.
After that, pain. But you didn't see any sort of terrain
floating/rushing up to meet you, because it was very dark.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The next time he came round, everything had changed. He felt
vulnerable and exposed. As his eyes opened and he tried to remember
how to see, he slowly made out dusty streaks of light in a brown
gloom, and saw earthenware pots near a mud or earth wall, and a small
fireplace in the centre of the room, and spears leaning against a
wall, and other blades. Straining his neck to bring his head up, he
could see something else; the rough wooden frame he was tied to.</p>
<p>
The wooden frame was in the shape of a square; two diagonals made an
X inside the square. He was naked, his hands and feet lashed, one to
each corner of the frame, which was propped against a wall at about
forty-five degrees. A thick hide strap secured his waist to the
centre of the X, and all over his body were markings of blood and
paint.</p>
<p>
He relaxed his neck. 'Oh shit,' he heard himself croak. He didn't
like the look of this.</p>
<p>
Where the hell <I>was</I> the Culture? They ought to be rescuing him;
that was their job. He did their dirty work, they looked after him.
This was the deal. So where the hell were they?</p>
<p>
The pain came back, like an old friend by now, from almost
everywhere. Straining his neck like that had hurt. Sore head (maybe
concussion); broken nose, cracked or broken ribs, one broken arm, two
broken legs. Maybe internal injuries; his insides felt pretty sore
too; the worst, in fact. He felt bloated and full of decay.</p>
<p>
Shit, he thought, I might actually be dying.</p>
<p>
He shifted his head, grimacing, (pain poured in as if some protecting
shell on his skin had been cracked by the movement) and looked at the
ropes lashing him to the wooden frame. Traction was no way to treat a
fracture, he told himself, and laughed very briefly, because with the
first contraction of his stomach muscles his ribs pulsed suddenly, as
though they were at red heat.</p>
<p>
He could hear things; distant noises of people shouting now and
again, and children yelling, and some sort of animal baying.</p>
<p>
He closed his eyes, but heard nothing more distinct. He opened them
again. The wall was earth, and he was probably underground, for there
were thick sawn-off roots sticking into the space around him. The
light was composed of two nearly vertical shafts, slightly angled
beams of direct sunlight, so... near midday, near the equator.
Underground, he thought, and felt sick. Nice and hard to find. He
wondered if the plane had been on course when it crashed, and how far
from the crash site he'd been carried. No point in worrying about it.</p>
<p>
What else could he see? Crude benches. A coarse cushion, dented. It
looked like somebody had sat there, facing him. He assumed it was the
owner of the hand he had felt, if there had been one. There was no
fire in a circle of stones set underneath one of the holes in the
roof. Spears leant against the wall, and other weaponish things were
strewn about the place. They were not battle-weapons; ceremonial, or
maybe torture. He caught a whiff of something awful, just then, and
knew it was gangrene, and knew it must be him.</p>
<p>
He began to slip over the edge again, uncertain whether he was
falling asleep or really going unconscious, but hoping for one or the
other, willing either, because all this was more than he could handle
just now. Then the girl came in. She had a jug in her hand, and set
it down before looking at him. He tried to speak, but couldn't. Maybe
he hadn't really spoken earlier when he'd thought he said, 'Shit.' He
looked at the girl and attempted a smile.</p>
<p>
She went out again.</p>
<p>
He felt somehow heartened, seeing the girl. A man would have been bad
news, he thought. A girl meant things might not be so bad after all.
Maybe.</p>
<p>
The girl came back, with a bowl of water. She washed him, rubbing
away the the blood and the paint. There was some pain. Predictably
nothing happened when she washed his genitals; he'd have liked to
show signs of life, just for form's sake.</p>
<p>
He tried to speak, but failed. The girl let him sip some water from a
shallow bowl, and he croaked at her, but nothing distinguishable.
She left again.</p>
<p>
The next time she came back with some men. They wore many strange
clothes, like feathers and skins and bones and wooden tiles of armour
laced with gut. They were painted too, and they brought pots and
small sticks with them, and used them to paint him again.</p>
<p>
They finished and stood back. He wanted to tell them he didn't suit
red, but nothing came out. He felt himself falling away, out into the
darkness.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
When he came to again, he was moving.</p>
<p>
The entire frame he was strapped to had be lifted and carted out of
the gloom. He faced the sky. Blinding light filled his eyes, dust
filled his nose and mouth, and shouts and screams filled his mind. He
felt himself shiver like a fever victim, tearing pain from each
shattered limb. He tried to shout, and to raise his head to see, but
all there was was noise and dust. His insides felt worse; skin taut
over his belly.</p>
<p>
Then he was upright again, and the village was beneath him. It was
small, there were some tents, some wicker and clay dwellings and some
holes into the ground. Semi-arid; an indeterminate scrub - stamped
down inside the perimeter of the village - vanished quickly beyond
it, into a yellow-glowing mist. The sun was just visible, low down.
He couldn't work out if it was dawn or dusk.</p>
<p>
What he really saw were the people. They were all in front of him; he
was up on a mound, the frame tied to two large stakes, and the people
were beneath him, all on their knees, heads bowed. There were tiny
children, their heads forced down by nearby adults, there were old
people held up from collapsing completely by those around them, and
every age in between.</p>
<p>
Then in front of him walked three people, the girl and two of the
men. The men, one on either side of the girl, lowered their heads,
knelt down quickly and arose again, and made a sign. The girl did not
move, and her gaze was fixed on a point between his eyes. She was
dressed in a bright red gown now; he could not remember what she had
worn before.</p>
<p>
One of the men held a large earthenware pot. The other had a long,
curved, broad-bladed sword.</p>
<p>
'Hey,' he croaked. He couldn't manage anything else. The pain was
getting very bad now; being upright didn't do his broken limbs any
good at all.</p>
<p>
The chanting people seemed to swing about his head; the sunlight
dipped and veered, and the three people in front of him became many,
multiplying and wavering, unsteady in the waste of mist and dust
before him.</p>
<p>
Where the hell was Culture?</p>
<p>
There was a terrible roaring noise in his head, and the diffuse glow
in the midst which was the sun was starting to pulse. The sword
glittered to one side; the earthenware pot gleamed on the other. The
girl stood directly in front of him, and put her hand into his hair,
grasping it.</p>
<p>
The roaring noise was filling his ears, and he could not tell if he
was shouting and screaming or not. The man to his right raised the
sword.</p>
<p>
The girl pulled his hair, yanking his head out; he screamed, above
the roaring noise, as his broken bones grated. He stared at the dust
at the hem of the girl's robe.</p>
<p>
'You bastards!' he thought, not sure, even then, exactly who he
meant.</p>
<p>
He managed to scream one syllable. 'El -!'</p>
<p>
Then the blade slammed into his neck.</p>
<p>
The name died. Everything had ended but it still went on.</p>
<p>
There was no pain. The roaring noise was actually quieter. He was
looking down at the village and the crouching people. The view swung;
he could still feel the pull of the roots of his hair straining at
the skin on his scalp. He was swung round.</p>
<p>
The slack, headless body dribbled blood down its chest.</p>
<p>
That was me! he thought. Me!</p>
<p>
He was swung round again; the man with the sword was wiping blood
from the blade with a rag. The man with the earthenware pot was
trying not to look into his staring eyes, and holding the pot out
towards him, the lid in his other hand. So <I>that's</I> what it's
for, he thought, feeling somehow stunned into an eerie calmness. Then
the roaring noise seemed to gather and start to fade at once. The
view was going red. He wondered how much longer this could go on. How
long did a brain survive without oxygen?</p>
<p>
Now I really am two, he thought, remembering, eyes closing.</p>
<p>
And he thought of his heart, stopped now, and only then realised, and
wanted to cry but could not, for he had finally lost her. Another
name formed in his kind. Dar...</p>
<p>
The roar split the skies. He felt the girl's grip loosen. The
expression on the face of the youth holding the pot was almost
comically fearful. People looked up from the crowd; the roar became a
scream, a blast of air swept dust into the air and made the girl
holding him stagger; a dark shape swung quickly through the air above
the village.</p>
<p>
A little late... he heard himself think, slipping away.</p>
<p>
There was more noise for a second or two - screams, maybe - and
something whacked into his head, and he was rolling away, dust in his
mouth and eyes... but he was starting to lose interest in all that
stuff, and was happy to let the darkness wash over him. Maybe he was
picked up again, later.</p>
<p>
But that seemed to happen to somebody else.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
When the terrible noise came, and the great, carved black rock landed
in the middle of the village - just after the sky's offering had been
separated from his body and so joined to the air - everybody ran into
the thinning mist, to get away from the screaming light. They
gathered, whimpering, at the water hole.</p>
<p>
After only fifty heartbeats, the dark shape appeared above the
village again, rising hazily into the thinner mists near the sky. It
did not roar this time, but moved quickly off with a noise like the
wind, and shrank to nothing.</p>
<p>
The shaman sent his apprentice back to see how things stood; the
quaking youth disappeared into the mist. He returned safely, and the
shaman led the still terrified people back to the village.</p>
<p>
The body of the sky-offering still hung limply on the wooden frame at
the summit of the mound. His head had disappeared.</p>
<p>
After much chanting and grinding entrails, spotting shapes in the
mists and three trances, the priest and his apprentice decided it was
a good omen, and yet a warning at the same time. They sacrificed a
meat-animal belonging to the family of the girl who had dropped the
sky-offering's head, and put the beast's head in the earthenware pot
instead.</p>

<p>
'Dizzy! How the devil are you?' He took her hand and helped her up
onto the wooden pier from the roof of the just-surfaced module. He
put his arms round her. 'Good to see you again!' he laughed. Sma
patted his waist, finding herself unwilling to hug him back. He
didn't seem to notice.</p>
<p>
He let her go, looked down to see the drone rising up from the
module. 'And Skaffen-Amtiskaw! They still letting you out without a
guard?'</p>
<p>
'Hello, Zakalwe,' the drone said.</p>
<p>
He put his arm round Sma's waist. 'Come on up to the shack; we'll
have lunch.'</p>
<p>
'All right,' she said.</p>
<p>
They walked along the small wooden pier to a stone path laid across
the sand, and on into the shade under the trees. The trees were blue
or purple; huge puff heads of dark colour standing out against the
pale blue sky, and tugged at by a warm, intermittent breeze. They
sweated delicate perfumes from the tops of their silver-white trunks.
The drone lifted to above tree height a couple of times, when other
people passed on the path.</p>
<p>
The man and woman walked through the sunlit avenues between the trees
until they came to where a wide pool of water trembled reflections of
twenty or so white huts; a small, sleek seaplane floated at a wooden
jetty. They entered the cluster of buildings and climbed some steps
to a balcony that looked over the pool and the narrow channel that
led from it to the lagoon on the far side of the island.</p>
<p>
The sun was sifted through the tree-heads; shadows moved to and fro
along the veranda and over the small table and the two hammocks.</p>
<p>
He motioned Sma to sit on the first hammock; a female servant
appeared and he ordered lunch for two. When the servant had gone,
Skaffen-Amtiskaw floated down and sat on the parapet of the veranda's
wall, overlooking the pool. Sma levered herself into the hammock
carefully.</p>
<p>
'It true you own this island, Zakalwe?'</p>
<p>
'Um...' he looked round, apparently uncertain, then nodded his head.
'Oh yes; so I do.' He kicked off his sandals and slumped into the
other hammock, letting it sway. He picked up a bottle from the floor,
and with each sway of the hammock poured a little more from the
bottle into two glasses on the small table. He increased the swing
when he had finished to be able to hand her drink to her.</p>
<p>
'Thank you.'</p>
<p>
He sipped at his drink and closed his eyes. She watched the glass on
his chest where his hands held it, and watched the liquid swill this
way, that way, lethargic and eye-brown. She moved her gaze to his
face and saw he had not changed; hair a bit darker than she
remembered; swept away from his broad, tanned forehead and tied in a
pony-tail behind. Fit-looking as ever. No older-looking, of course,
because they'd stabilised his age as part of his payment for the last
job.</p>
<p>
His eyes opened slowly, heavy-lidded, and he looked back at her,
smiling slowly. The eyes look older, she thought. But she could have
been wrong.</p>
<p>
'So,' she said, 'we playing games here, Zakalwe?'</p>
<p>
'What do you mean, Dizzy?'</p>
<p>
'I've been sent to get you back again. They want you to do another
job. You must have guessed that, so tell me now whether I'm wasting
my time here or not. I'm in no mood to try and argue you...'</p>
<p>
'Dizzy!' he exclaimed, sounding hurt, pivoting his legs off the
hammock and onto the floor, then smiling persuasively, 'Don't be like
that; of course you're not wasting your time. I've already packed.'</p>
<p>
He beamed at her like a happy child, his tanned face open and
smiling. She looked at him with relief and disbelief.</p>
<p>
'So what was all the run-around for?'</p>
<p>
'What run-around?' he said innocently, sitting back in the hammock
again. 'I had to come here to say goodbye to a close friend, that was
all. But I'm ready to go. What's the scam?'</p>
<p>
Sma stared, open-mouthed. Then she turned to the drone. 'Do we just
go now?'</p>
<p>
'No point,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said. 'The course the GSV's on, you can
have two hours here, then go back to the <I>Xenophobe</I>; it can
match with the <I>What</I> in about thirty hours.' It swivelled to
look at the man. 'But we need a definite word. There's a teratonne of
GSV with twenty-eight million people on board charging in this
direction; if it's to wait here it has to slow down first, so it
needs to know for sure. You really are coming? This afternoon?'</p>
<p>
'Drone, I just <I>told</I> you. I'll do it.' He leaned towards Sma.
'What is the job again?'</p>
<p>
'Voerenhutz,' she told him. 'Tsoldrin Beychae.'</p>
<p>
He beamed, teeth gleaming. 'Old Tsoldrin still above ground? Well,
it'll be good to see him again.'</p>
<p>
'You have to talk him back into his working clothes again.'</p>
<p>
He waved one hand airily. 'Easy,' he said, drinking.</p>
<p>
Sma watched him drink. She shook her head.</p>
<p>
'Don't you want to know why, Cheradenine?' she asked.</p>
<p>
He started to make a gesture with one hand that meant the same as a
shrug, then thought better of it. 'Umm; sure. Why, Diziet?' he
sighed.</p>
<p>
'Voerenhutz is coalescing into two groups; the people gaining the
upper hand at the moment want to pursue aggressive terraforming
policies...'</p>
<p>
'That's sort of...' he burped, 're-decorating a planet, right?'</p>
<p>
Sma closed her eyes briefly. 'Yes. Sort of. Whatever you choose to
call it, it's ecologically insensitive, to put it mildly. These
people - they call themselves the Humanists - also want a sliding
scale of sentient rights which will have the effect of letting them
take over whatever even intelligently inhabited worlds they're
militarily able to. There are a dozen brush-fire wars going on right
now. Any one of them could spark the big one, and to an extent the
Humanists encourage these wars because they appear to prove their
case that the Cluster is too crowded and needs to find new planetary
habitats.'</p>
<p>
'They also,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said, 'refuse to acknowledge machine
sentience fully; they exploit proto-conscious computers and claim
only human subjective experience has any intrinsic value; carbon
fascists.'</p>
<p>
'I see,' he nodded, and looked very serious. 'And you want old
Beychae to get into harness with these Humanist guys, right?'</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine!' Sma scolded, as Skaffen-Amtiskaw's fields went frosty.</p>
<p>
He looked hurt. 'But they're called the Humanists!'</p>
<p>
'That's just their name, Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
'Names are important,' he said, apparently serious.</p>
<p>
'It's still just what they call themselves; it doesn't make them the
good guys.'</p>
<p>
'Okay.' He grinned at Sma. 'Sorry.' He tried to look more
business-like. 'You want him pulling in the other direction, like
last time.'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' Sma said.</p>
<p>
'Fine. Sounds almost easy. No soldiering?'</p>
<p>
'No soldiering.'</p>
<p>
'I'll do it.' He nodded.</p>
<p>
'Do I hear the sound of a barrel-bottom being scraped?'
Skaffen-Amtiskaw muttered.</p>
<p>
'Just send the signal.' Sma told it.</p>
<p>
'Okay,' said the drone. 'Signal sent.' It made a good impression of
glowering at the man with its fields. 'But you'd better not change
your mind.'</p>
<p>
'Only the thought of having to spend any time in your company,
Skaffen-Amtiskaw, could possibly disinduce me from accompanying the
delightful Ms Sma here to Voerenhutz.' He glanced concernedly at the
woman. 'You are coming, I hope.'</p>
<p>
Sma nodded. She sipped at her drink, while the servant laid some
small dishes on the table between the hammocks.</p>
<p>
'Just like that, Zakalwe?' she said, once the servant had gone again.</p>
<p>
'Just like what, Diziet?' He smiled over his glass.</p>
<p>
'You're leaving. After, what... five years? Building up your empire,
sorting out your scheme to make the world a safer place, using our
technology, trying to use our methods... you're prepared just to walk
away from it all, for however long it takes? Dammit, even before you
knew it was Voerenhutz you'd said yes; could have been on the other
side of the galaxy, for all you knew; could have been the Clouds. You
might have been saying yes to a four-year trip.'</p>
<p>
He shrugged. 'I like long voyages.'</p>
<p>
Sma looked into the man's face for a while. He looked unworried, full
of life. Pep and vim were the words that came to mind. She felt
vaguely disgusted.</p>
<p>
He shrugged, eating some fruit from one of the little dishes,
'Besides, I have a trust arrangement set up. It'll all be looked
after until I come back.'</p>
<p>
'If there's anything to come back to,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw observed.</p>
<p>
'Of course there will be,' he said, spitting a pip over the edge of
the veranda wall. 'These people like to talk about war, but they
aren't suicidal.'</p>
<p>
'Oh, that's all right then,' the drone said, turning away.</p>
<p>
The man just smiled at it. He nodded at Sma's untouched plate. 'You
not hungry, Diziet?'</p>
<p>
'Lost my appetite,' she said.</p>
<p>
He swung out of the hammock, brushing his hand together. 'Come on,'
he said, 'let's go for a swim.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
She watched him trying to catch fish in a small rock pool; paddling
around in his long trunks. She had swum in her briefs.</p>
<p>
He bent down, engrossed, his earnest face peering into the water, his
face reflected there. He seemed to speak to it.</p>
<p>
'You still look very good, you know. I hope you feel suitably
flattered.'</p>
<p>
She went on drying herself. 'I'm too old for flattery, Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
'Rubbish.' He laughed, and the water rippled under his mouth. He
frowned hard and dipped his hands under, slowly.</p>
<p>
She watched the concentration on his face as his arms slid deeper
under the water, mirroring themselves.</p>
<p>
He smiled again, his eyes narrowing as his hands steadied; his arms
were in deep now, and he licked his lips.</p>
<p>
He lunged forward, yelled excitedly, then cupped his hands out of the
water and came over to her where she sat against some rocks. He was
grinning hugely. He held his hands out for her to see. She looked in
and saw a small fish, brilliant shimmering blue and green and red
and gold, a gaudy splash of rippling light squirming inside the man's
cupped hands. She frowned as he leant back against the rock again.</p>
<p>
'Now just you put that back where you found it, Cheradenine, and the
way you found it.'</p>
<p>
His face fell and she was about to say something else, kinder, when
he grinned again and threw the fish back into the pool.</p>
<p>
'As if I'd do anything else.' He came and sat beside her on the rock.</p>
<p>
She looked out to sea. The drone was further up the beach, ten metres
behind them. She carefully smoothed the tiny dark hairs on her
forearms until they were lying flat. 'Why did you try all that stuff,
Zakalwe?'</p>
<p>
'Giving the elixir of youth to our glorious leaders?' He shrugged.
'Seemed like a good idea at the time,' he confessed, lightly. 'I
don't know; I thought it might be possible. I thought interfering was
maybe a lot easier then you lot made it out to be. I thought one man
with a strong plan, not interested in his own aggrandisement...' He
shrugged, glanced at her. 'It might all work out yet. You never
know.'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe, it isn't going to work out. You're leaving us an incredible
mess here.'</p>
<p>
'Ah,' he nodded. 'You are coming in, then. Thought you might.'</p>
<p>
'In some fashion, I think we'll have to.'</p>
<p>
'Best of luck.'</p>
<p>
'Luck...' Sma began, but then thought the better of it. She ran her
fingers through her damp hair.</p>
<p>
'How much trouble am I in, Diziet?)</p>
<p>
'For this?'</p>
<p>
'Yes, and the knife missile. You heard about that?'</p>
<p>
'I heard.' She shook her head. 'I don't think you're in any more
trouble than you're ever in, Cheradenine, just by being you.'</p>
<p>
He smiled. 'I hate the Culture's... tolerance.'</p>
<p>
'So,' she said, slipping her blouse over her head, 'what are your
terms?'</p>
<p>
'Pay as well, eh?' He laughed. 'Minus the rejuve... the same as the
last time. Plus ten per cent more negotiables.'</p>
<p>
'Exactly the same?' She looked at him sadly, her wet bedraggled hair
hanging down from her shaking head.</p>
<p>
He nodded. 'Exactly.'</p>
<p>
'You're a fool, Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
'I keep trying.'</p>
<p>
'It won't be any different.'</p>
<p>
'You can't know that.'</p>
<p>
'I can guess.'</p>
<p>
'And I can hope. Look, Dizzy, it's my business, and if you want me to
come with you then you've got to agree to it, all right?'</p>
<p>
'All right.'</p>
<p>
He looked wary. 'You still know where she is?'</p>
<p>
Sma nodded. 'Yes, we know.'</p>
<p>
'So it's agreed?'</p>
<p>
She shrugged and looked out to sea. 'Oh; it's agreed. I just think
you're wrong. I don't think you should go to her again.' She looked
him in the eye. 'That's my advice.'</p>
<p>
He stood up and dusted some sand off his legs.</p>
<p>
'I'll remember.'</p>
<p>
They walked back to the huts and the still sea pool in the centre of
the island. She sat on a wall, waiting while he made his final
goodbyes. She listened for crying, or the sound of breakages, but in
vain.</p>
<p>
The wind blew her hair gently, and to her surprise, despite it all,
she felt warm and well; the scent from the tall trees stretched
around her, and their shifting shadows made the ground seem to move
in time with the breeze so that air and trees and light and earth
swayed and rippled like the bright-dark water in the island's central
pool. She closed her eyes and sounds came to her like faithful pets,
nuzzling her ear; sounds of the brushing tree-heads, like tired
lovers dancing; sounds of the ocean, swirling over rocks, softly
stroking the golden sands; sounds of what she did not know.</p>
<p>
Perhaps soon she would be back in the house below the grey-white dam.</p>
<p>
What an asshole you are, Zakalwe, she thought. I could have stayed
home; they could have sent the stand-in... dammit, they could
probably have just sent the drone, and you'd still have come...</p>
<p>
He appeared looking bright and fresh and carrying a jacket. A
different servant carried some bags. 'Okay; let's go,' he said.</p>
<p>
They walked to the pier while the drone tracked them, overhead.</p>
<p>
'By the way,' she said. 'Why ten per cent more money?'</p>
<p>
He shrugged as they walked onto the wooden pier. 'Inflation.'</p>
<p>
Sma frowned. 'What's that?'</p>
<p>

<p>
When you sleep beside a head full of images, there is an osmosis, a
certain sharing in the night. So he thought. He thought a lot then;
more than he ever had, perhaps. Or maybe he was just more aware of
the process, and the identity of thought and passing time. Sometimes
he felt as though every instant he spent with her was a precious
capsule of sensation to be lovingly wrapped and carefully placed
somewhere inviolable, away from harm.</p>
<p>
But he only fully realised that later; it wasn't something he was
fully aware of at the time. At the time, it seemed to him that the
only thing he was fully aware of, was her.</p>
<p>
He lay, often, looking at her sleeping face in the new light that
fell in through the open walls of the strange house, and he stared at
her skin and hair with his mouth open, transfixed by the quick
stillness of her, struck dumb with the physical fact of her existence
as though she was some careless star-thing that slept on quite
unaware of its incandescent power; the casualness and ease with which
she slept there amazed him; he couldn't believe that such beauty
could survive without some superhumanly intense conscious effort.</p>
<p>
On such mornings he would lie and look at her and listen to the
sounds that the house made in the breeze. He liked the house; it
seemed... fit. Normally, he'd have hated it.</p>
<p>
Here and now, though, he could appreciate it, and happily see it as a
symbol; open and closed, weak and strong, outside and inside. When
he'd first seen it, he'd thought it would blow away in the first
serious gale, but it seemed these houses rarely collapsed; in the
very rare storms, people would retreat to the centre of the
structures, and huddle round the central fire, letting the various
layers and thicknesses of covering shake and sway on their posts,
gradually sapping the force of the wind, and providing a core of
shelter.</p>
<p>
Still - as he'd pointed out to her when he first saw it from the
lonely ocean road - it would be easy to torch and simple to rob,
stuck out here in the middle of nowhere. (She'd looked at him as
though he were mad, but then kissed him.)</p>
<p>
That vulnerability intrigued and troubled him. There was a likeness
to her there; to her as a poet and as a woman. It was similar, he
suspected, to one of her images; the symbols and metaphors she used
in the poems he loved to hear her read out loud but could never quite
understand (too many cultural allusions, and this baffling language
he had not yet fully understood, and still sometimes made her laugh
with). Their physical relationship seemed to him at once more whole
and complete, and more defyingly complex than anything similar he had
known. The paradox of love physically incarnate and the most personal
attack being the same thing tied knots in him, sometimes sickened
him, as in the midst of this joy he fought to understand the
statements and promises that might be being implied.</p>
<p>
Sex was an infringement, an attack, an invasion; there was no other
way he could see it; every act, however magical and intensely
enjoyed, and however willingly conducted, seemed to carry a harmonic
of rapacity. He took her, and however much she gained in provoked
pleasure and in his own increasing love, she was still the one that
suffered the act, had it played out upon her and inside her. He was
aware of the absurdity of trying too hard to develop the comparison
between sex and war; he had been laughed out of several embarrassing
situations trying to do so ('Zakalwe,' she would say, when he tried
to explain some of this, and she would put her cool slim fingers
behind his neck, and stare out from the rumbustious black tangle of
her hair, 'You have serious problems.' She would smile), but the
feelings, the acts, the structure of the two were to him so close, so
self-evidently akin, that such a reaction only forced him deeper into
his confusion.</p>
<p>
But he tried not to let it bother him; at any time he could simply
look at her and wrap his adoration for her around himself like a coat
on a cold day, and see her life and body, moods and expressions and
speech and movements as a whole enthralling field of study that he
could submerge himself in like a scholar finding his life's work.</p>
<p>
(This was more like it, some small, remindful voice inside him said.
This is more like the way it's suppose to be; with this, you can
leave all that other stuff behind, the guilt and the secrecy and the
lies; the ship and the chair and the other man... But he tried not
listen to that voice.)</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
They'd met in a port bar. He'd just arrived and thought he'd make
sure their alcohol was as good as people had said. It was. She was in
the next dark booth, trying to get rid of a man.</p>
<p>
You're saying nothing lasts forever, he heard the fellow whine.
(Well, pretty trite, he thought.)</p>
<p>
No, he heard her say. I'm saying with very few exceptions nothing
lasts forever, and amongst those exceptions, no work or thought of
man is numbered.</p>
<p>
She went on talking after this, but he homed in on that. That was
better, he thought. I liked that. She sounds interesting. Wonder
what she looks like?</p>
<p>
He stuck his head round the corner of the booth and looked in at
them. The man was in tears; the woman was... well, lots of hair...
<I>very</I> striking face; sharp and almost aggressive. Tidy body.</p>
<p>
'Sorry,' he told them. 'But I just wanted to point out that &quot;Nothing
lasts forever&quot; can be a positive statement... well, in some
languages...' Having said it, it did occur to him that in this
language it wasn't; they had different words for different sorts of
nothing. He smiled, ducked back into his own booth, suddenly
embarrassed. He stared accusatorily at the drink in front of him.
Then he shrugged, and pressed the bell to attract a waiter.</p>
<p>
Shouts from the next booth. A clatter and a little shriek. He looked
round to see the man storming off through the bar, heading for the
door.</p>
<p>
The girl appeared at his elbow. She was dripping.</p>
<p>
He looked up into her face; it was damp; she wiped it with a
handkerchief.</p>
<p>
'Thank you for your contribution,' she said icily. 'I was bringing
things to a conclusion quite smoothly there until you stepped in.'</p>
<p>
'I'm very sorry,' he said, not at all.</p>
<p>
She took her handkerchief and wrung it out over his glass, dribbling.
'Hmm,' he said, 'too kind.' He nodded at the dark spots on her grey
coat. 'Your drink or his?'</p>
<p>
'Both,' she said, folding the kerchief and starting to turn away.</p>
<p>
'Please; let me buy you a replacement.'</p>
<p>
She hesitated. The waiter arrived at the same moment. <I>Good omen</I>,
he thought. 'Ah,' he said to the man. 'I'll have another... whatever
it is I've been drinking, and for this lady...'</p>
<p>
She looked at his glass. 'The same,' she said. She sat down across
the table.</p>
<p>
'Think of it as... reparations,' he said, digging the word out of the
implanted vocabulary he'd been given for his visit.</p>
<p>
She looked puzzled. '&quot;Reparations&quot;... that's one I'd
forgotten; something to do with war, isn't it?'</p>
<p>
'Yep,' he said, smothering a belch with one hand. 'Sort of like...
damages?'</p>
<p>
She shook her head. 'Wonderfully obscure vocabulary, but totally
bizarre grammar.'</p>
<p>
'I'm from out of town,' he said breezily. This was true. He'd never
been within a hundred light years of the place.</p>
<p>
'Shias Engin,' she nodded. 'I write poems.'</p>
<p>
'You're a poet?' he said, delighted. 'I've always been fascinated by
poets. I tried writing poems, once.'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' she sighed and looked wary. 'I suspect everyone does, and you
are...?'</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine Zakalwe; I fight wars.'</p>
<p>
She smiled. 'I thought there hadn't been a war for three hundred
years; aren't you getting a little out of practice?'</p>
<p>
'Yeah; boring, isn't it?'</p>
<p>
She sat back in the seat, took off her coat. 'From just how far out
of town have you come, Mr Zakalwe?'</p>
<p>
'Aw heck, you've guessed,' he looked downcast. 'Yeah; I'm an alien.
Oh. Thank you.' The drinks arrived; he passed one to her.</p>
<p>
'You do look funny,' she said, inspecting him.</p>
<p>
' &quot;Funny&quot;?' he said indignantly.</p>
<p>
She shrugged. 'Different.' She drank. 'But not all that different.'
She leaned forward on the table. 'Why do you look so similar to us? I
know all the outworlders aren't humanoid, but a lot are. How come?'</p>
<p>
'Well,' he said, hand at his mouth again, 'It's like this; the...' he
belched. '... the dustclouds and stuff in the galaxy are... its food,
and its food keeps speaking back to it. That's why there are so many
humanoid species; nebulae's last meals repeating on them.'</p>
<p>
She grinned. 'That simple, is it?'</p>
<p>
He shook his head. 'Na; not at all. Very complicated. But,' he held
up one finger. 'I think I know the real reason.'</p>
<p>
'Which is?'</p>
<p>
'Alcohol in the dust clouds. Goddamn stuff is everywhere. Any lousy
species ever invents the telescope and the spectroscope and starts
looking in between the stars, what do they find?' He knocked the
glass on the table. 'Loads of stuff; but much of it alcohol.' He
drank from the glass. 'Humanoids are the galaxy's way of trying to
get rid of all that alcohol.'</p>
<p>
'It's all starting to make sense now,' she agreed, nodding her head
and looking serious. She looked inquisitively at him. 'So, why are
you here? Not come to start a war. I hope.'</p>
<p>
'No, I'm on leave; come to get away from them. That's why I chose
this place.'</p>
<p>
'How long you here for?'</p>
<p>
'Till I get bored.'</p>
<p>
She smiled at him. 'And how long do you think that will take?'</p>
<p>
'Well,; he smiled back, 'I don't know.' He put his glass down. She
drained hers. He reached out for the button to call the waiter, but
her finger was already there.</p>
<p>
'My turn,' she said. 'Same again?'</p>
<p>
'No,' he said. 'Something quite different, this time, I feel.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
When he tried to tabulate his love, list all the things about her
that drew him to her, he found himself starting at the larger facts -
her beauty, her attitude to life, her creativity - but as he thought
over the day that had just passed, or just watched her, he found
individual gestures, single words, certain steps, a single movement
of her eyes or a hand starting to claim equal attention. He would
give up then, and console himself with something she'd said; that you
could not love what you fully understood. Love, she maintained, was a
process; not a state. Held still, it withered. He wasn't too sure
about all that; he seemed to have found a calm clear serenity in
himself he hadn't even known was there, thanks to her.</p>
<p>
The fact of her talent - maybe her genius - played a role, too. It
added to the extent of his disbelief, this ability to be more than
the thing he loved, and to present to the outside world an entirely
different aspect. She was what he knew here and now, complete and
rich and measureless, and yet when both of them were dead (and he
found he could think about his own death again now, without fear), a
world at least - many cultures, perhaps - would know her as something
utterly dissimilar, a poet; a fabricator of sets of meanings that to
him were just words on a page or titles that she sometimes mentioned.</p>
<p>
One day, she said, she would write a poem about him, but not yet. He
thought what she wanted was for him to tell her the story of his
life, but he had already told her he could never do that. He didn't
need to confess to her; there was no need. She had already unburdened
him, even if he did not know quite how. Memories are interpretations,
not truth, she insisted, and rational thought was just another
instinctive power.</p>
<p>
He felt the slowly healing polarisation of his mind, matching his to
hers, the alignment of all his prejudices and conceits to the
lodestone of the image she represented for him.</p>
<p>
She helped him, and without knowing it. She mended him, reaching back
to something so buried he'd thought it inaccessible forever, and
drawing its sting. So perhaps it was also that which stunned him; the
effect this one person was having on memories so terrible to him that
he had long ago resigned himself to them only growing more potent
with age. But she just ringed them off, cut them out, parcelled them
up and threw them away, and she didn't even realise she was doing it,
had no idea of the extent of her influence.</p>
<p>
He held her in his arms.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'How old are you?' she'd asked, near dawn on that first night.</p>
<p>
'Older and younger than you.'</p>
<p>
'Cryptic crap; answer the question.'</p>
<p>
He grimaced into the darkness. 'Well... how long do you people live?'</p>
<p>
'I don't know. Eighty, ninety years?'</p>
<p>
He had to remember the length of the year, here. Close enough. 'Then
I'm... about two hundred and twenty; a hundred and ten; and thirty.'</p>
<p>
She whistled, moved her head on his shoulder. 'A choice.'</p>
<p>
'Sort of. I was born two hundred and twenty years ago, I have lived
for a hundred and ten of them, and physically I'm about thirty.'</p>
<p>
The laughter was deep in her throat. He felt her breasts sweep across
his chest as she swung on top of him. 'I'm fucking a hundred-and-ten
year old?' she sounded amused.</p>
<p>
He laid his hands on the small of her back, smooth and cool. 'Yeah;
great, isn't it? All the benefits of experience without the con -'</p>
<p>
She came down kissing him.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He put his head to her shoulder, drew her tighter. She stirred in her
sleep, moved too, her arms around him, drawing him to her. He smelled
the skin of her shoulder, breathing in the air that had been on her
flesh, was scented by her, perfumed by no perfume, carrying her own
smell only. He closed his eyes, to concentrate on this sensation. He
opened them, drew in her sleeping look again, moved his head to hers,
his tongue out flickering under her nose to feel the flow of breath,
anxious to touch the thread of her life. The tip of his tongue, and
the tiny hollow between her lips and her nose, vexed and caved, as if
designed.</p>
<p>
Her lips parted, closed again; her lips rubbed against each other,
side to side, and her nose wrinkled. He watched these things with a
secret delight, as fascinated as a child playing boo with an adult
who kept disappearing round the side of a cot.</p>
<p>
She slept on. He rested his head again.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
That first morning, in the grey dawn, he had lain there while she
inspected his body minutely.</p>
<p>
'So many scars, Zakalwe,' she said, shaking her head, tracing lines
across his chest.</p>
<p>
'I keep getting into scraps,' he admitted. 'I could have all these
heal completely, but... they're good for... remembering.'</p>
<p>
She put her chin on her chest. 'Come on; admit you just like showing
them off to the girls.'</p>
<p>
'There is that, too.'</p>
<p>
'This one looks nasty, if your heart's in the same place as ours...
given that everything else seems to be.' She ran her finger round a
little puckered mark near one nipple. She felt him tense, and looked
up. There was a look in the man's eyes that made her shiver. Suddenly
he seemed all the years he'd claimed, and more. She drew herself up,
ran her hand through her hair. 'That one still a bit fresh, huh?'</p>
<p>
'That's...' he made the effort of trying to smile, and ran his own
finger over the tiny dimpled crease on his flesh. '... that's one of
the oldest, funnily enough.' The look faded from his eyes.</p>
<p>
'This one?' she said brightly, touching one side of his head.</p>
<p>
'Bullet.'</p>
<p>
'In a big battle?'</p>
<p>
'Well, sort of. In a car, to be precise. A woman.'</p>
<p>
'Oh no!' she clapped a hand to her mouth, mimicking horror.</p>
<p>
'It was very embarrassing.'</p>
<p>
'Well, we won't go into that one... what about this?'</p>
<p>
'Laser... very strong light,' he explained, when she looked puzzled.
'Much longer ago.'</p>
<p>
'This one?'</p>
<p>
'Ahm... combination of things; insects, in the end.'</p>
<p>
'<I>Insects</I>?' She quivered.</p>
<p>
(And he was back there; in the drowned volcano. A long time ago, now,
but still there, still within him... and still safer to think about
than that crater over his heart, where another, even more ancient
memory dwelt. He remembered the caldera, and saw again the pool of
stagnant water, the stone at its centre and the surrounding walls of
the poisoned lake. He felt once more the long slow scrape his body
had made, and the intimacy of insects... But that remorseless
concentricity didn't matter any more; here was here and now was now.)</p>
<p>
'You don't want to know,' he grinned.</p>
<p>
'I think I'll take your word for that,' she agreed, nodding slowly,
the long black hair swinging heavily. 'I know; I'll kiss them all
better.'</p>
<p>
'Could be a long job,' he told her as she swivelled and moved to his
feet.</p>
<p>
'You in a hurry?' she asked him, kissing a toe.</p>
<p>
'Not at all,' he smiled, lying back. 'Take all the time you want.
Take forever.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He felt her move, and looked down. Her knuckles rubbed her eyes, her
hair spilled, she patted her nose and cheeks and smiled at him. He
looked at her smile. He had seen a few smiles he might have killed
for, but never one he'd have died for. What else could he do but
smile back?</p>
<p>
'Why do you always wake before me?'</p>
<p>
'I don't know,' he sighed. So did the house, as the breeze moved its
equivocal walls. 'I like watching you sleep.'</p>
<p>
'Why?' She rolled and lay on her back, turning her head to him, the
hair rolling bounteously to him. He laid his head on that dark
fragrant field, remembering the smell of her shoulder, stupidly
wondering if she smelt different awake than asleep.</p>
<p>
He nuzzled her shoulder and she laughed a little, shrugging that
shoulder and pressing her head against his. He kissed her neck and
answered before he forgot the question completely</p>
<p>
'When you're awake you move, and I miss things.'</p>
<p>
'What things?' He felt her kissing his head.</p>
<p>
'Everything you do. When you're asleep you hardly move, and I can
take it all in. There's enough time.'</p>
<p>
'Strange.' Her voice was slow.</p>
<p>
'You smell the same awake as you do asleep, did you know that?' He
propped up his head and looked into her face, grinning.</p>
<p>
'You...' she started, then looked down. Her smile looked very sad
when she looked back up. 'I love hearing that sort of nonsense,' she
said.</p>
<p>
He heard the unsaid part. 'You mean; you love hearing that sort of
nonsense now, but won't at some indeterminate point in the future.'
(He hated the awful triteness of it, but she had her own scars.)</p>
<p>
'I suppose,' she said, holding one of his hands.</p>
<p>
'You think too much about the future.'</p>
<p>
'Maybe we cancel out each other's obsessions, then.'</p>
<p>
He laughed. 'I suppose I walked into that one.'</p>
<p>
She touched his face, studied his eyes. 'I really shouldn't fall in
love with you, Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
'Why not?'</p>
<p>
'Lots of reasons. All the past and all the future; because you are
who you are, and I am who I am. Just everything.'</p>
<p>
'Details,' he said, waving one hand.</p>
<p>
She laughed, shaking her head and burying it in her own hair. She
surfaced and gazed up at him.</p>
<p>
'I just worry it won't last.'</p>
<p>
'Nothing lasts, remember?'</p>
<p>
'I remember,' she nodded slowly.</p>
<p>
'You think this won't last?'</p>
<p>
'Right now... it feels... I don't know. But if we ever want to hurt
each other...'</p>
<p>
'Then let's not do that,' he said.</p>
<p>
She lowered her eyelids, bent her head to him, and he put out his
hand and cradled her head.</p>
<p>
'Maybe it is that simple,' she said. 'Perhaps I like to dwell on what
might happen so as never to be surprised.' She brought her face up to
his. 'Does that worry you?' she said, her head shaking, an expression
very like pain around here eyes.</p>
<p>
'What?' He leant forward to kiss her, smiling, but she moved her head
to indicate she did not want to, and he drew back while she said:</p>
<p>
'That I... can't believe enough not have doubts.'</p>
<p>
'No. I don't worry about that.' He did kiss her.</p>
<p>
'Strange that taste-buds have no taste,' she murmured into his neck.
They laughed together.</p>
<p>
Sometimes, at night, lying there in the dark when she was asleep or
silent, he thought he saw the real ghost of Cheradenine Zakalwe come
walking through the curtain walls, dark and hard and holding some
huge deadly gun, loaded and set; the figure would look at him, and
the air around him seemed to drip with... worse than hate; derision.
At such moments, he was conscious of himself lying there with her,
lying as love-struck and besotted as any youth, lying there wrapping
his arms around a beautiful girl, talented and young, for whom there
was nothing he wouldn't do, and he knew perfectly and completely that
to what he had been - to what he had become or always was - that sort
of unequivocal, selfless, retreating devotion was an act of shame,
something that had to be wiped out. And the real Zakalwe would raise
his gun, look him in the eye through the sights and fire, calmly and
unhesitatingly.</p>
<p>
But then he would laugh and turn to her, kiss her or be kissed, and
there was no threat and no danger under this sun or any other that
could take him from her then.</p>
<p>
'Don't forget we've got to go up to that krih today. This morning, in
fact.'</p>
<p>
'Oh yes,' he said. He rolled onto his back, she sat up and stretched
her arms out, yawning, forcing her eyes wide and glaring up at the
fabric roof. Her eyes relaxed, her mouth closed, she looked at him,
rested her elbow on the head of the bed, and combed his hair with her
fingers. 'It probably isn't stuck though.'</p>
<p>
'Mmm, maybe not,' he agreed.</p>
<p>
'It might not be there when we look today.'</p>
<p>
'Indeed.'</p>
<p>
'If it is still there we'll go up, though.'</p>
<p>
He nodded, reached up, took her hand, clasped.</p>
<p>
She smiled, quickly kissed him and then sprang out of the bed and
walked to the far level. She opened the waving translucent drapes
and unslung a pair of field glasses from a hook on a frame-pole. He
lay and watched her as she brought the glasses to her eyes, surveyed
the hillside above.</p>
<p>
'Still there,' she said. Her voice was far away. He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>
'We'll go up today. Maybe in the afternoon.'</p>
<p>
'We should.' Far away.</p>
<p>
'All right.'</p>
<p>
Probably the stupid animal hadn't got stuck at all; more than likely
it had dozed off into an absent-minded hibernation. They did that, so
he heard; they just stopped eating and looked ahead and stared with
their big dumb eyes at something, and closed them sleepily and went
into a coma, purely by accident. The first rain, or a bird landing on
it would probably wake it. Perhaps it was stuck though; the krih had
thick coats and they got entangled with the bushes and tree branches
sometimes, and couldn't move. They would go up today; the view was
pleasant, and anyway he could do with some exercise that wasn't
mostly horizontal. They would lie on the grass and talk, and look out
to the sea sparkling in the haze, and maybe they would have to free
the animal, or wake it up, and she would look after it with a look he
knew not to disturb, and in the evening she would write, and that
would be another poem.</p>
<p>
As a nameless lover, he had appeared in many of her recent works,
though as usual she would throw the bulk of them away. She said she
would write a poem specifically about him, one day, maybe when he had
told her more about his life.</p>
<p>
The house whispered, moved in its parts, waving and flowing,
spreading light and dimming it; the varying thicknesses and
strengths of drape and curtain that formed the walls and divisions of
the place rustled against each other secretly, like half-heard
conversations.</p>
<p>
Far away, she put her hand to her hair, pulled one side absently as
she moved papers on the desk around with one finger. He watched. Her
finger stirred through what she'd written yesterday, toying with the
parchments; circling them around slowly; slowly flexing and turning,
watched by her, watched by him.</p>
<p>
The glasses hung from her other hand, straps down, forgotten, and he
wandered a long slow gaze over her as she stood against the light;
feet, legs, behind, belly, chest, breasts, shoulders, neck; face and
head and hair.</p>
<p>
The finger moved on the desk top where she would write a short poem
about him in the evening, one he would copy secretly in case she
wasn't happy with it and threw it out, and as his desire grew and her
calm face saw no finger move, one of them was just a passing thing,
just a leaf pressed between the pages of the other's diary, and what
they had talked themselves into, they could be silent out of.</p>
<p>
'I must do some work today,' she said to herself.</p>
<p>
There was a pause.</p>
<p>
'Hey?' he said.</p>
<p>
'Hmm?' Her voice was far away.</p>
<p>
'Let's waste a little time, hmm?'</p>
<p>
'A nice euphemism, sir,' she mused, distantly.</p>
<p>
He smiled. 'Come and help me think of better ones.'</p>
<p>
She smiled, and they both looked at each other.</p>
<p>
There was a long pause.</p>

<p>
Swaying slightly, scratching his head, he put the gun stock-down on
the floor of the smallbay, held the weapon by its barrel, and
squinted one-eyed into the muzzle, muttering.</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe,' Diziet Sma said, 'we diverted twenty-eight million people
and a trillion tonnes of space ship two months off course to get you
to Voerenhutz on time; I'd appreciate it if you'd wait until the job
is done before you blow your brains out.'</p>
<p>
He turned round to see Sma and the drone entering the rear of the
smallbay; a traveltube capsule flicked away behind them.</p>
<p>
'Eh?' he said, then waved. 'Oh, hi.' He wore a white shirt - sleeves
rolled up - black pantaloons, and nothing on his feet. He picked the
plasma rifle up, shook it, banged it on the side with his free hand,
and sighted down the length of the smallbay. He steadied, squeezed
the trigger.</p>
<p>
Light flared briefly, the gun leapt back at him, and there was an
echoing snap of noise. He looked down to the far end of the bay, two
hundred metres away, where a glittering black cube perhaps fifteen
metres to a side sat under the overhead lights. He peered at the
distant black object, pointed the gun at it again, and inspected the
magnified view on one of the gun's screens. 'Weird,' he muttered, and
scratched his head.</p>
<p>
There was a small tray floating at his side; it held an ornate metal
jug and a crystal goblet. He took a drink from the goblet, staring
intently at the gun.</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe,' Sma said. 'What, exactly, are you doing?'</p>
<p>
'Target practice,' he said. He drank from the goblet again. 'You want
a drink, Sma? I'll order another glass...'</p>
<p>
'No thanks.' Sma looked down to the far end of the bay, at the
strange and gleaming black cube. 'And what is <I>that</I>?'</p>
<p>
'Ice,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said.</p>
<p>
'Yeah,' he nodded, putting the goblet down to adjust something on the
plasma rifle. 'Ice.'</p>
<p>
'Dyed black ice,' the drone said.</p>
<p>
'Ice,' Sma said, nodding, but none the wiser. 'Why ice?'</p>
<p>
'Because,' he said, sounding annoyed, 'this... this <I>ship</I> with
the incredibly silly name and its twenty-eight trillion people and
its hyper-zillion billion squintillion tonnage hasn't got any decent
<I>rubbish</I>, that's why.' He flicked a couple of switches on the
side of the rifle, aimed again. 'Trillion fucking tonnes and it
hasn't got any goddamn garbage; apart from its brain, I suppose.' He
squeezed the trigger again. His shoulder and arm were pushed back
once more, while the light flickered from the weapon's muzzle and
sound stuttered. He stared at the view in the sight-screen. 'This is
ridiculous!' he said.</p>
<p>
'But why are you shooting at ice?' Sma insisted.</p>
<p>
'Sma,' he cried, 'are you deaf? Because this parsimonious pile of
junk claims it hasn't got any rubbish on board it can let me shoot
at.' He shook his head, opened an inspection panel on the side of the
weapon.</p>
<p>
'Why not shoot at target holos like everybody else?' Sma asked.</p>
<p>
'Holos are all very well, Diziet, but...' He turned and presented her
with the gun. 'Here; hold this a minute, will you? Thanks.' He
fiddled with something inside the inspection panel while Sma held the
gun in both hands. The plasma rifle was a metre and a quarter long,
and very heavy. 'Holos are all right for calibration and that sort of
crap, but for... for getting the <I>feel </I>of a weapon, you have to
really... really <I>waste</I> something, you know?' He glanced at
her. 'You have to feel the kick, and see the debris. Real debris. Not
this holographic shit; the real stuff.'</p>
<p>
Sma and the drone exchanged looks.</p>
<p>
'You hold this... cannon,' Sma said to the machine.
Skaffen-Amtiskaw's fields were glowing pink with amusement. It took
the weight of the gun from her while the man continued to tinker with
the weapon's insides.</p>
<p>
'I don't think a General Systems Vehicle thinks in terms of junk,
Zakalwe,' Sma said, sniffing dubiously at the contents of the
ornately-worked metal jug. She wrinkled her nose. 'Just matter that's
currently in use and matter that's available to be recycled and
turned into something else to be used. No such thing as rubbish.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah,' he muttered. 'That's the crap it came out with as well.'</p>
<p>
'Gave you ice instead, eh?' the drone said.</p>
<p>
'Had to settle for it.' He nodded, clicking the armoured inspection
panel back into place and lifting the gun out of the drone's grip.
'Should take a hit all right, but now I can't get the damn gun to
work.'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe,' the drone sighed. 'It would hardly be surprising if it
isn't working. That thing belongs in a museum. It's eleven hundred
years old. We make pistols that are more powerful, nowadays.'</p>
<p>
He sighted carefully, breathed smoothly... then smacked his lips, put
the gun down and took a drink from the goblet. He looked back at the
drone. 'But this thing's <I>beautiful</I>,' he told the machine,
taking up the gun and flourishing it. He slapped the weapon's darkly
cluttered side. 'I mean, take a good look at it; it <I>looks</I>
powerful!' He gave an admiring growl, then took up his stance again
and shot.</p>
<p>
This firing fared no better than the others. He sighed and shook his
head, staring at the weapon. 'It's not working,' he said plaintively.
'It just isn't working. I'm getting recoil, but it just isn't
working.'</p>
<p>
'May I?' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said. It floated towards the gun. The man
looked suspiciously at the drone. Then he turned the gun over to it.</p>
<p>
The plasma rifle flashed from every available screen, things clicked
and beeped, the inspection panels flicked open and shut, and then the
drone gave the gun back to the man. 'It's in perfect working order,'
it said.</p>
<p>
'Huh.' He held the weapon in one hand, up and out from his body, then
slapped the back of the stock with his other hand, whirling the big
rifle round so that it spun like a rotor in front of his face and
chest. He didn't take his eyes off the drone while he did this. He
was still looking at the machine when he twisted his wrist, brought
the gun to a stop - already aimed straight at the distant black cube
of ice - and fired it, all in one smooth action. Again, the gun
seemed to fire, but the ice sat undisturbed.</p>
<p>
'The hell it's working,' he said.</p>
<p>
'How exactly did your conversation with the ship go, when you asked
for your &quot;rubbish&quot;?' the drone inquired.</p>
<p>
'I don't remember,' he said loudly. 'I told it what a complete cretin
it was for not having some junk to shoot at, and it said when people
wanted to shoot at real shit they usually used ice. So I said, all
right then, you scumbag rocket... or something like that; give me
some ice!' He held out his hands expressively. 'That was all.' He
dropped the gun.</p>
<p>
The drone caught it. 'Try asking it to clear the bay for firing
practice,' it suggested. 'Specifically, ask it to clear a space in
its trapdoor coverage.'</p>
<p>
He accepted the gun from the drone, looking disdainful. 'All right,'
he said slowly. He looked about to say something else, talking into
mid-air, then looked uncertain. He scratched his head, glanced at the
drone and appeared to be about to talk to it, then looked away again.
Finally he jabbed a finger at Skaffen-Amtiskaw. 'You... you ask
for... all that. It'll sound better coming from another machine.'</p>
<p>
'Very well. It's done,' the drone said. 'You only had to ask.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm,' he said. He switched his suspicious look from the drone to the
distant black cube. He lifted the gun and aimed at the icy mass.</p>
<p>
He fired.</p>
<p>
The gun rammed back against his shoulder, and a blinding flash of
light threw his shadow behind him. The sound was like a grenade going
off. A pencil-thin white line seared the length of the smallbay and
joined the gun to the fifteen metre cube of ice, which shattered into
a million fragments in a floor-thumping detonation of light and steam
and a furiously blossoming cloud of black vapour.</p>
<p>
Sma stood, her hands clasped behind her back, and watched debris
fountain fifty metres to the top of the bay, where it ricocheted off
the roof. More black shrapnel flew the same distance to crash into
the bay's side walls... and tumbling, glittering black shards
slithered across the floor towards them. Most skidded to a stop on
the ridged surface of the bay, though a few small pieces - blown a
long way through the air before thumping into the deck - did actually
slide past the two humans and the watching drone, and clunk into the
rear wall of the bay. Skaffen-Amtiskaw picked up a fist-size piece
from near Sma's feet. The sound of the explosion echoed clangingly
back off the walls a few times, gradually fading.</p>
<p>
Sma felt her ears relax. 'Happy, Zakalwe?' she asked.</p>
<p>
He blinked, then switched the gun off and turned to Sma. 'Seems to be
working all right now,' he shouted.</p>
<p>
Sma nodded. 'Mm-hmm.'</p>
<p>
He motioned with his head. 'Let's go get a drink.' He took up the
goblet, and drank as he walked towards the traveltube port.</p>
<p>
'A drink?' Sma said, falling into step with the man and nodding at
the glass he was drinking from. 'Why; what's that?'</p>
<p>
'Nearly finished, that's what this is,' he told her, loudly. He
poured a last half-glass from the metal jug into the goblet.</p>
<p>
'Ice?' the drone offered, holding up the dripping black lump.</p>
<p>
'No thanks.'</p>
<p>
Something flickered in the traveltube, and a capsule was suddenly
there, door rolling open. 'What's this... trapdoor coverage, anyway?'
he asked the machine.</p>
<p>
'General Systems Vehicle internal explosion protection,' the drone
explained, letting the humans board the capsule first. 'Snaps
anything significantly more powerful than a fart straight into
hyperspace; blast, radiation; the lot.'</p>
<p>
'Shit,' he said, disgusted. 'You mean you can let nukes off in these
fuckers and they don't even <I>notice</I>?'</p>
<p>
The drone wobbled. '<I>They</I> notice; probably nobody else does.'</p>
<p>
The man stood swaying in the capsule, watching the door roll back
into place, shaking his head sorrily. 'You people just have no idea
of fair play, do you?'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The last time he had been on a GSV had been ten years earlier, after
he'd almost died on Fohls.</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine?... Cheradenine?'</p>
<p>
He heard the voice, but wasn't sure the woman was really talking to
him. It was a beautiful voice. He wanted to reply to it. But he
couldn't work out how to. It was very dark.</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine?'</p>
<p>
A very patient voice. Concerned, somehow, but a hopeful voice; a
cheerful, even loving voice. He tried to remember his mother.</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine?' the voice said again. Trying to get him to wake up.
But he <I>was</I> awake. He tried moving his lips.</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine... can you hear me?'</p>
<p>
He moved his lips, exhaled at the same time, and thought he might
have produced a noise. He tried to open his eyes. The darkness
wavered.</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine...?' There was a hand at his face, gently stroking his
cheek. <I>Shias</I>! he thought for a second, then swept that memory
away to where he kept all the others.</p>
<p>
'H...' he managed. Just the start of a sound.</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine...' the voice said, close to his ear now. 'It's Diziet
here. Diziet Sma. Remember me?'</p>
<p>
'Diz...' he succeeded in saying, after a couple of failures.</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine?'</p>
<p>
'Yeah...' he heard himself breathe.</p>
<p>
'Try to open your eyes, will you?'</p>
<p>
'Try'n...' he said. Then light came, as though it had had nothing to
do with him trying to open his eyes. Things took a while to gel, but
eventually he saw a restful green ceiling, illuminated from the
sides by a fan-shaped glow of concealed lighting, and Diziet Sma's
face looking down at him.</p>
<p>
'Well done, Cheradenine.' She smiled at him. 'How are you feeling?'</p>
<p>
He thought about this. 'Weird,' he said. He was thinking hard now,
trying to remember how he'd got here. Was this some sort of hospital?
How <I>had </I>he got here?</p>
<p>
'Where is this?' he said. Might as well try the direct approach. He
tried shifting his hands, but without success. Sma glanced somewhere
over his head as he did so.</p>
<p>
'The GSV <I>Congenital Optimist</I> You're all right... you're going
to be all right.'</p>
<p>
'If I'm all right, why can't I move my hands or fee... shit.'</p>
<p>
Suddenly he was tied to the wooden frame again; the girl was in front
of him. He opened his eyes and saw her; Sma. A misty, uncertain light
glowed all around. He wrenched at his bonds, but there was no sign of
give, no hope... he felt the tug on his hair, then the thudding cut
of the blade, and saw the girl in the red robe looking at him from
somewhere over his be-bodied head.</p>
<p>
Everything revolved. He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>
The moment passed. He swallowed. He took a breath and opened his eyes
again; at least these things seemed to be working. Sma looked down,
relieved. 'You just remembered?'</p>
<p>
'Yeah. I just remembered.'</p>
<p>
'You going to be okay?' She sounded serious, but still reassuring.</p>
<p>
'I'll be all right,' he said. Then; 'it's just a scratch.'</p>
<p>
She laughed, looked away for a bit, and when she looked to him again,
she was biting her lip.</p>
<p>
'Hey,' he said. 'Narrow one, this time, huh?' he smiled.</p>
<p>
Sma nodded. 'You could say that. Another few seconds and you'd have
suffered brain damage; another few minutes and you'd have been dead.
If only you'd had a homing implant; we could have picked you up
days...'</p>
<p>
'Oh now, Sma,' he said gently. 'You know I can't be bothered with
all that stuff.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah, I know,' she said. 'Well, whatever; you're going to have to
stay like this for a while.' Sma smoothed hair from his forehead.
'It'll take about two hundred days or so to grow a new body. They
want me to ask you; do you want to sleep through the whole thing, or
do you want to stay awake as normal... or anything in between? It's
up to you. Makes no difference to the process.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm.' He thought about this. 'I suppose I get to do lots of
improving things, like listen to music and watch films or whatever,
and read?'</p>
<p>
'If you want,' Sma shrugged. 'You can go the whole hog and spool
fantasy head-tapes if you want.'</p>
<p>
'Drink?'</p>
<p>
'<I>Drink</I>?'</p>
<p>
'Yeah; can I get drunk?'</p>
<p>
'I don't know,' Sma said, looking above and to one side. A voice
muttered something.</p>
<p>
'Who's that?' he asked.</p>
<p>
'Stod Perice.' A young man nodded, coming into view, upside down.
'Medic. Hello there, Mr Zakalwe. I'll be looking after you, however
you decide to spend the time.'</p>
<p>
'D'you dream when you're under, if you do it that way?' he asked the
medic.</p>
<p>
'Depends how deep you want to go. We can send you so far down you
think no more than a second's passed during those two hundred days,
or you can lucid dream every second of them. Whatever you want.'</p>
<p>
'What do most people do?'</p>
<p>
'Switch right off; wake up with a new body after no appreciable
time.'</p>
<p>
'Thought so. Can I get drunk while I'm hooked up to whatever the
hell it is I'm hooked up to?'</p>
<p>
Stod Perice grinned. 'I'm sure we could arrange it. If you want, we
could give you drug-glands; ideal opportunity, just...'</p>
<p>
'No thanks.' He closed his eyes briefly and tried to shake his head.
'Occasional inebriety will be quite sufficient.'</p>
<p>
Stod Perice nodded. 'Well, I think we can rig you for that.'</p>
<p>
'Great. Sma?' he looked at her. She raised her eyebrows. 'I'll stay
awake,' he told her.</p>
<p>
Sma smiled slowly. 'I had a feeling you might.'</p>
<p>
'You sticking around?'</p>
<p>
'Could do,' the woman said. 'Would you like me to?'</p>
<p>
'I'd appreciate it.'</p>
<p>
'And I'd like to.' She nodded thoughtfully. 'Okay. I'll watch you put
on weight.'</p>
<p>
'Thanks. And thanks for not bringing that goddamn drone. I can
imagine the jokes.'</p>
<p>
'... Yes,' Sma said, hesitantly, so that he said:</p>
<p>
'Sma? What is it?'</p>
<p>
'Well...' The woman looked uncomfortable.</p>
<p>
'Tell me.'</p>
<p>
'Skaffen-Amtiskaw,' she said, awkwardly. 'It sent you a present.' She
fished a small package from her pocket, flourished it, embarrassed.
'I... I don't know what it is, but...'</p>
<p>
'Well <I>I</I> can't open it. Come on, Sma.'</p>
<p>
Sma opened the package. She looked at the contents. Stod Perice leant
over, and then turned quickly away, holding one hand at his mouth,
coughing.</p>
<p>
Sma pursed her lips. 'I may ask for a new escort drone.'</p>
<p>
He closed his eyes. 'What is it?'</p>
<p>
'It's a hat.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He laughed at that. Sma did too, eventually (though she threw things
at the drone, later). Stod Perice accepted the hat as an onward-gift.</p>
<p>
It was only later, in the dim red of the hospital section light,
while Sma danced slowly with some new conquest, and Stod Perice was
dining out with friends and telling them the story of the hat, and
life went on throughout the rest of the great ship, that he
remembered how, a few years earlier, and very far away, Shias Engin
had traced the wounds on his body (cool slim fingers on the puckered
new-looking flesh, the smell of her skin and the tingling sweep of
her hair).</p>
<p>
And in two hundred days he would have a new body. And (<I>And
this?... I'm sorry. Still fresh, that one</I>?)... the wound over his
heart would be gone forever, and the heart beneath his chest would
not be the same one.</p>
<p>
And he realised he had lost her.</p>
<p>
Not Shias Engin, whom he'd loved, or thought he had, and certainly
lost... but her; the other one, the real one, the one who'd lived
within him through a century of icy sleep.</p>
<p>
He had thought he would not lose her until the day he died.</p>
<p>
Now he knew differently, and felt broken by the knowledge and the
loss.</p>
<p>
He whispered her name to the quiet red night.</p>
<p>
Overhead, the ever-watchful medical monitoring unit saw some fluid
seep from the bodiless human's tear ducts, and wondered dumbly at it.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'How old is old Tsoldrin, now?'</p>
<p>
'Eighty, relative,' the drone said.</p>
<p>
'You think he'll want to come out of retirement? Just because I ask
him to?' He looked sceptical.</p>
<p>
'You're all we could think of,' Sma told him.</p>
<p>
'Can't you just let the old guy grow old in peace?'</p>
<p>
'There's a little more at stake than the happy retirement of one
ageing politico, Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
'What? The universe? Life as we know it?'</p>
<p>
'Yes; tens, maybe hundreds of millions of times over.'</p>
<p>
'Very philosophical.'</p>
<p>
'And you didn't let the Ethnarch Kerian grow old in peace, did you?'</p>
<p>
'Damn right,' he said, and wandered a little further into the
armoury. 'That old pisshead deserved to die a million times.'</p>
<p>
The converted minibay engineering space housed a dazzling array of
Culture and other weaponry. Zakalwe, Sma thought, was like a kid in a
toy store. He was selecting gear and loading it onto a pallet which
Skaffen-Amtiskaw was guiding after the man, down the aisles of racks
and drawers and shelves all stuffed and packed with projectile
weapons, line guns, laser rifles, plasma projectors, multitudinous
grenades, effectors, plane charges, passive and reactive armour,
sensory and guard devices, full combat suits, missile packs, and at
least a dozen other distinctly different types of device Sma didn't
recognize.</p>
<p>
'You'll never be able to carry this lot, Zakalwe. 'This is just the
shortlist,' he told her. He took a stocky, boxy-looking gun with no
appreciable barrel from a shelf. He held it out to the drone, 'What's
this?'</p>
<p>
'CREWS; assault rifle,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said. 'Seven fourteen tonne
batteries; seven-element single shot to forty-four point eight
kilorounds a second (minimum firing time eight point seven five
seconds), maximum single burst; seven times two-fifty kilogrammes;
frequency from mid-visible to high X-ray.'</p>
<p>
He hefted it. 'Not very well balanced.'</p>
<p>
'That's its stowed configuration. Slide the whole top back.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm.' He pretended to aim the readied gun. 'Now, what's to stop you
putting your supporting hand over here, where the beams are going?'</p>
<p>
'Common sense?' suggested the drone.</p>
<p>
'Uh-huh. I'll stick with my obsolete plasma rifle.' He put the gun
back. 'Anyway, Sma; you should be pleased old men do want to come out
of retirement for you. Dammit, I should be devoting myself to
gardening or something, not storming off to the galactic backwoods
doing your dirty work.'</p>
<p>
'Oh, yeah,' Sma said. 'And a big struggle I had too, convincing you
to quit your &quot;gardening&quot; and come back to us. Shit,
Zakalwe; your bags were packed.'</p>
<p>
'I must have telepathically already have realized the urgency of the
situation.' He heaved a massive black gun from a rack, swung it with
both hands, grunting with the effort. 'Holy shit. Do you fire this
mother or just use it as a battering ram?'</p>
<p>
'Idiran hand cannon,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw sighed. 'Don't wave it around
like that; it's very old and quite rare.'</p>
<p>
'No fucking wonder.' He struggled to lift the gun back into its rack,
then continued down the aisle. 'Come to think of it, Sma, I'm so old
my whole life ought to be on triple time or something; I'm probably
grossly undercharging you for this whole sorry escapade.'</p>
<p>
'Well, if you're going to look at it that way, we should be charging
you for... patent infringement? Giving those old guys their youth
back using our technology.'</p>
<p>
'Don't knock it. You don't know what it's like getting that old that
early.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah, but it applies to everybody; you were giving it only to the
most evil, power-mad bastards on the planet.'</p>
<p>
'They were top-down societies! What do you expect? Anyway; if I'd
given it to everybody... think of the population explosion!'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe, I thought about that when I was about fifteen; they teach
you that sort of stuff in early school, in the Culture. It was all
thought through long ago; it's part of our history, part of our
upbringing. That's why what you did would look insane to a
school-kid. <I>You</I> are like a school-kid, to us. You don't even
want to get old. Nothing more immature than that.'</p>
<p>
'Whoo!' he said, stopping suddenly and taking something from an open
shelf. 'What's <I>this</I>?'</p>
<p>
'Beyond your ken,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said.</p>
<p>
'What a beauty!' He gripped the stunningly complicated weapon and
twirled it. 'What <I>is</I> this?' he breathed.</p>
<p>
'Micro Armaments System, Rifle,' the drone narrated. 'It's... oh,
look, Zakalwe; it has ten separate weapon systems, not including the
semi-sentient guard facility, the reactive shield components, the
IFF-set quick-reaction swing-packs or the AG unit, and before you
ask, the controls are all on the wrong side because that's the
left-hand bias version, and the balance - like the weight and the
independently variable inertia - are fully adjustable. It also takes
about half a year's training just to learn how to use it <I>safely</I>,
let alone competently, so you can't have one.'</p>
<p>
'I don't <I>want</I> one,' he said, stroking the weapon. 'But what a
<I>device</I>!' He put it back with the rest. He glanced at Sma.
'Dizzy; I know the way you people think; I respect it, I guess... but
your life isn't my life. I live in unsafe ways in dangerous places;
always have done, always will do. I'll die soon enough anyway, so why
should I suffer the additional burden of getting old, even slowly?'</p>
<p>
'Don't try and hide behind necessity, Zakalwe. You could have changed
your life; you don't have to live the way you do; you could have
joined the Culture, become one of us; at least lived the way we do,
but -'</p>
<p>
'Sma!' he exclaimed, turning to her. 'That's for you; it isn't for
me. You think I'm wrong to have my age stabilised; even the chance of
immortality is... wrong, to you. Okay; I can see that. In your
society, the way you live your lives, of course it is. You have your
three-fifty, four hundred years, and know you'll get right to the end
of them; die with your boots off. For me... that won't work. I don't
have that certainty. I enjoy the perspective from the edge, Sma; I
like to feel that up-draft on my face. So sooner or later I'll die;
violently, probably. Maybe even foolishly, because that's often the
way of it; you avoid nukes and determined assassins... and then choke
on a fish bone... but who cares? So; your stasis is your society, and
mine... is my age. But we are both assured of death.'</p>
<p>
Sma looked at the floor, hands clasped behind her back. 'All right,'
she said. 'But don't forget who gave you that perspective from the
edge.'</p>
<p>
He smiled sadly. 'Yes; you saved me. But you've also lied to me; sent
- no, listen - sent me on damn fool missions where I was on the
opposite side from the one I thought I was on, had me fight for
incompetent aristos I'd gladly have strangled, in wars where I didn't
know you were backing both sides, filled my balls full of alien seed
I was supposed to inject into some poor damn female... nearly got me
killed... <I>very</I> nearly got me killed a dozen times or more...'</p>
<p>
'You've never forgotten me for that hat, have you?' Skaffen-Amtiskaw
said, with fake bitterness.</p>
<p>
'Oh, Cheradenine,' Sma said. 'Don't pretend it hasn't been fun, too.'</p>
<p>
'Sma, believe me; it has not all been &quot;fun&quot;.' He leant
against a cabinet full of ancient projectile weapons. 'And, worse
than all that,' he insisted, 'is when you turn the goddamn maps
upside-down.'</p>
<p>
'What?' Sma said, puzzled.</p>
<p>
'Turning the maps upside down,' he repeated. 'Have you any <I>idea</I>
how annoying and inconvenient it is when you get to a place and find
that they map the place the other way up compared to the maps you've
got? Because of something stupid like some people think a magnetic
needle is pointing up to heaven, when other people think it's just
heavier and pointing <I>down</I>? Or because it's done according to
the galactic plane or something? I mean, this might sound trivial,
but it's <I>very</I> upsetting.'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe, I had no idea. Let me offer you my apologies and those of
the entire Special Circumstances Section; no, all of Contact; no: the
entire Culture; no: all intelligent species.'</p>
<p>
'Sma, you remorseless bitch, I'm trying to be serious.'</p>
<p>
'No, I don't think you are. Maps...'</p>
<p>
'But it's true! They turn them the wrong way up!'</p>
<p>
'Then there must,' Diziet Sma said, 'be a reason for it.'</p>
<p>
'What?' he demanded.</p>
<p>
'Psychology,' Sma and the drone said at the same time.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Two suits?' Sma said later, when he was making his final equipment
selection. They were still in the armoury mini-bay, but
Skaffen-Amtiskaw had gone off to do something more interesting than
watch a kid shop for toys.</p>
<p>
He heard the accusatory tone in Sma's voice, and looked up. 'Yes; two
suits. So what?'</p>
<p>
'Those can be used to imprison somebody, Zakalwe; I know that.
They're not just for protection.'</p>
<p>
'Sma; if I'm lifting this guy out of a hostile environment, with no
immediate help from you guys because you have to stand off and be
seen to be pure - fake though that might be - I have to have the
tools to do the job. Serious FYT suits are numbered among those
tools.'</p>
<p>
'One,' Sma said.</p>
<p>
'Sma, don't you trust me?'</p>
<p>
'One,' Sma repeated.</p>
<p>
'Goddamn it! All right!' He dragged the suit away from the pile of
equipment.</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine,' Sma said, suddenly conciliatory. 'Remember; we need
Beychae's... commitment, not just his presence. That's why we
couldn't impersonate him; that's why we couldn't tamper with his
mind...'</p>
<p>
'Sma, you're sending <I>me to</I> tamper with his mind.'</p>
<p>
'All right,' Sma said, suddenly nervous-looking. She clapped her
hands once softly, looked a little embarrassed. 'By the way,
Cheradenine, ah... what exactly are your plans? I know better than to
ask for a mission profile or anything formal, but how <I>do</I> you
mean to get to Beychae?'</p>
<p>
He sighed. 'I'm going to make him want to come to me.'</p>
<p>
'How?'</p>
<p>
'Just one word.'</p>
<p>
'A <I>word</I>?'</p>
<p>
'A name.'</p>
<p>
'What, yours?'</p>
<p>
'No; mine was supposed to be kept a secret when I was advisor to
Beychae, but it must have leaked out by now. Too dangerous. I'll use
another name.'</p>
<p>
'Ah hah.' Sma looked expectantly at him, but he went back to choosing
between the various bits of equipment he'd picked out.</p>
<p>
'Beychae's in this university, right?' he said, not turning to look
at Sma.</p>
<p>
'Yes; in the archives, almost permanently. But there are a lot of
archives and he moves around a lot, and there are always guards.'</p>
<p>
'Okay,' he told her. 'If you want to do something useful, try finding
something that the university might want.'</p>
<p>
Sma shrugged. 'It's a capitalist society. How about money?'</p>
<p>
'I'll be doing that myself...' he paused, looked suspicious. 'I will
be allowed plenty of discretion in that area, won't I?'</p>
<p>
'Unlimited expenses,' Sma nodded.</p>
<p>
He smiled. 'Wonderful.' He paused. 'What source? A tonne of platinum?
Sack of diamonds? My own bank?'</p>
<p>
'Well, more or less your own bank, yes,' Sma said. 'We've beea
building up something called the Vanguard Foundation since the last
war; commercial empire, comparatively ethical, expanding quietly.
That's where your unlimited expenses will come from.'</p>
<p>
'Well, with my unlimited expenses I'll probably try offering this
university lots of money; but it would be better if there was some
actual <I>thing </I>we could tempt them with.'</p>
<p>
'All right,' she said, nodding. Then her brow wrinkled. She indicated
the combat suit.' <I>What</I> did you call that thing?'</p>
<p>
He looked puzzled, then said, 'Oh; it's an FYT suit.'</p>
<p>
'Yes; a serious FYT suit; that's what you said. But I thought I knew
all the nomenclature; I've never heard that acronym before. What does
it stand for?'</p>
<p>
'It stands for a serious fuck-you-too suit.' He grinned.</p>
<p>
Sma made a clicking noise with her tongue. 'Should have known better
than to ask, shouldn't I?'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Two days later, they stood in the hangar of the <I>Xenophobe.</I> The
very fast picket had left the GSV a day earlier, slung at the
Voerenhutz cluster. It had accelerated hard, and now it was braking
hard. He was packing the gear he would need into a capsule that would
take him down to the surface of the planet where Tsoldrin Beychae
was; the initial stage of his in-system journey would be on a fast
three-person module; it would loiter in the atmosphere of a nearby
gas-giant planet. The <I>Xenophobe</I> itself would wait in
interstellar space, ready to provide support if needed.</p>
<p>
'Are you <I>positive</I> you don't want Skaffen-Amtiskaw to come with
you?'</p>
<p>
'Absolutely positive; keep that air-borne asshole to yourself.'</p>
<p>
'Some other drone?'</p>
<p>
'No.'</p>
<p>
'A knife missile?'</p>
<p>
'Diziet; <I>no</I>! I don't want Skaffen-Amtiskaw or anything else
that thinks it can think for itself.'</p>
<p>
'Hey; just refer to me as though I'm not here,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw
said.</p>
<p>
'Wishful thinking, drone.'</p>
<p>
'Better than none at all, so above par for you,' the machine said.</p>
<p>
He looked at the drone. 'You sure they didn't issue a factory-recall
on your batch number?'</p>
<p>
'Myself,' said the drone, sniffily, 'I have never been able to see
what virtue there could be in something that was eighty per cent
water.'</p>
<p>
'Anyway,' Sma said. 'You know all the relevant stuff, yes?'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' he said tiredly. The man's tanned, smoothly muscled body
rippled as he bent, securing the plasma rifle in the capsule. He wore
a pair of briefs. Sma - hair still tousled from bed, for this was
early morning by ship time - wore a jellaba.</p>
<p>
'You know the people to contact?' she fretted. 'And who's in charge
and on what side...'</p>
<p>
'And what to do if my credit facilities are suddenly withdrawn? Yes;
everything.'</p>
<p>
'If - when you get him out - you head for...'</p>
<p>
'The enchanting, sunny system of Impren,' he said tiredly, in a
sing-song voice, 'Where there are lots of friendly natives in a
variety of ecologically sound space Habitats. Which are neutral.'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe,' Sma said suddenly, taking his face in both hands and
kissing him. 'I hope this all works out.'</p>
<p>
'Me too, funnily enough,' he said. He kissed Sma back; she pulled
away eventually. He shook his head, running his gaze down and up the
woman's body, grinning. 'Ah... one day, Diziet.'</p>
<p>
She shook her head and smiled insincerely. 'Not unless I'm
unconscious or dead, Cheradenine.'</p>
<p>
'Oh. I can still hope, then?'</p>
<p>
Sma slapped his backside. 'On your way, Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
He stepped into the armoured combat suit. It closed around him. He
flipped the helmet back.</p>
<p>
He looked suddenly serious. 'You just make sure you know where -'</p>
<p>
'We know where she is,' Sma said quickly.</p>
<p>
He looked at the floor of the hanger for a moment, then smiled back
into Sma's eyes.</p>
<p>
'Good.' He clapped his gloves together. 'Great; I'll be off. See you
later, with any luck.' He stepped into the capsule.</p>
<p>
'Take care, Cheradenine,' Sma said.</p>
<p>
'Yes; look after your disgusting cloven butt,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said.</p>
<p>
'Depend on it,' he said, and blew both of them a kiss.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
From General Systems Vehicle to very fast picker to small module to
the lobbed capsule to the suit that stood in the cold desert dust
with a man encased inside it.</p>
<p>
He looked out through the open faceplate, and wiped a little sweat
from his brow. It was dusk over the plateau. A few metres away, by
the light of two moons and a fading sun, he could see the rimrock,
frost-whitened. Beyond was the great gash in the desert which
provided the setting for the ancient, half-empty city where Tsoldrin
Beychae now lived.</p>
<p>
Clouds drifted, and the dust collected.</p>
<p>
'Well,' he sighed, to no-one in particular, and looked up into yet
another alien sky. 'Here we are again.'</p>

The man stood on a tiny spur of clay and watched the roots of the
huge tree as they were uncovered and washed bare by a gurgling wash
of dun-coloured water. Rain swarmed through the air; the broad brown
swell of rushing water tearing at the roots of the tree leapt with
thrashing spray. The rain alone had brought visibility down to a
couple of hundred metres and had long since soaked the man in the
uniform to the skin. The uniform was meant to be grey, but the rain
and the mud had turned it dark brown. It had been a fine,
well-fitting uniform, but the rain and the mud had reduced it to a
flopping rag.</p>
<p>
The tree tipped and fell, crashing back into the brown torrent and
spraying mud over the man, who stepped back, and lifted his face to
the dull grey sky, to let the incessant rain wash the mud from his
skin. The great tree blocked the thundering stream of brown slurry
and forced some of it over the clay spur, forcing the man further
back, along a crude stone wall to a high lintel of ancient concrete,
which stretched, cracked and uneven, up to a small ugly cottage
squatting near the crown of the concrete hill. He stayed, watching
the long brown bruise of the swollen river as it flowed over and ate
into the little isthmus of clay; then the spur collapsed, the tree
lost its anchorage on that side of the river, and was turned round
and turned over and transported bodily on the back of the tumbling
waters, heading into the sodden valley and the low hills beyond. The
man looked at the crumbling bank on the other side of the flood,
where the great tree's roots protruded from the earth like ripped
cables, then he turned and walked heavily up towards the little
cottage.</p>
<p>
He walked round it. The vast square concrete plinth, nearly a
half-kilometre to a side, was still surrounded by water; brown waves
washed its edges on every side. The towering hulks of ancient metal
structures, long since fallen into disrepair, loomed through the haze
of rain, squatting on the pitted and cracked surface of the concrete
like forgotten pieces in some enormous game. The cottage - already
made ridiculous by the expanse of concrete around it - looked somehow
even more grotesque than the abandoned machines, just because of
their proximity.</p>
<p>
The man looked all about as he walked round the building, but saw
nothing that he wanted to see. He went into the cottage.</p>
<p>
The assassin flinched as he threw open the door. The chair she was
tied to - a small wooden thing - was balanced precariously against a
thick set of drawers, and when she jerked, its legs rasped on the
stone floor and sent chair and girl sliding to the ground with a
whack. She hit her head on the flagstones and cried out.</p>
<p>
He sighed. He walked over, boots squelching with each step, and
dragged the chair upright, kicking a piece of broken mirror away as
he did so. The woman was hanging slackly, but he knew she was faking.
He manoeuvred the chair into the centre of the small room. He watched
the woman carefully as he did this, and kept out of the way of her
head; earlier when he'd been tying her up she'd butted him in the
face, very nearly breaking his nose.</p>
<p>
He looked at her bonds. The rope that bound her hands behind the back
of the chair was frayed; she had been trying to cut through the
bindings using the broken hand-mirror from the top of the set of
drawers.</p>
<p>
He left her hanging inertly in the middle of the room, where he could
see her, then went over to the small bed cut into one thick wall of
the cottage, and fell heavily into it. It was dirty, but he was
exhausted and too wet to care.</p>
<p>
He listened to the rain hammering on the roof, and listened to the
wind whining through the door and the shuttered windows, and listened
to the steady plopping of drops coming through the leaking roof and
dropping onto the flagstones. He listened for the noise of
helicopters, but there were no helicopters. He had no radio and he
wasn't sure they knew where to look anyway. They would be searching
as well as the weather allowed, but they'd be looking for his staff
car, and it was gone; washed away by the brown avalanche of river.
Probably, it would take days.</p>
<p>
He closed his eyes, and started to fall asleep almost immediately,
but it was as though the consciousness of defeat would not let him
escape, and found him even there, filling his nearly sleeping mind
with images of inundation and defeat, and harried him out of his
rest, back into the continuing pain and dejection of wakefulness. He
rubbed his eyes, but the scummy water on his hands ground grains of
sand and earth into his eyes. He cleaned one finger as best he could
on the filthy rags on the bed, and rubbed some spit into his eyes,
because he thought if he allowed himself to cry, he might not be able
to stop.</p>
<p>
He looked at the woman. She was pretending to come round. He wished
he had the strength and the inclination to go over and hit her, but
he was too tired, and too conscious that he would be taking out on
her the defeat of an entire army. Belting any one individual - let
alone a helpless, cross-eyed woman - would be so pathetically petty a
way of trying to find recompense for a downfall of that magnitude
that even if he did live, he would be ashamed forever that he had
done such a thing.</p>
<p>
She moaned dramatically. A thin strand of snot detached itself from
her nose and fell onto the heavy coat she wore.</p>
<p>
He looked away, disgusted.</p>
<p>
He heard her sniff, loudly. When he looked back, her eyes were open,
and she was staring malevolently at him. She was only slightly
cross-eyed, but the imperfection annoyed him more than it should
have. Given a bath and a decent set of clothes, he thought, the woman
might almost have looked pretty. But right now she was buried inside
a greasy green greatcoat smudged all over with mud, and her dirty
face was almost completely hidden; partially by the collar of the
heavy coat, and partially by her long, filthy hair, which was
attached to the green greatcoat in various places by glistening blobs
of mud. She moved oddly in the chair, as though scratching her back
against the chair. He could not decide whether she was testing the
ropes that bound her, or was just troubled by fleas.</p>
<p>
He doubted she had been sent to kill him; almost certainly she was
what she was dressed as; an auxiliary. Probably she had been left
behind in a retreat and had wandered about too frightened or proud or
stupid to surrender until she had seen the staff car in difficulties
in the storm-washed hollow. Her attempt at killing him had been brave
but laughable. By sheer luck she'd killed his driver with one shot; a
second had struck him a glancing blow on the side of the head, making
him groggy while she threw the empty gun away and leapt into the car
with her knife. The driverless car had slid down a greasy grass slope
into the brown torrent of the river.</p>
<p>
Such a stupid act. Sometimes, heroics revolted him; they seemed like
an insult to the soldier who weighed the risks of the situation and
made calm, cunning decisions based on experience and imagination;
the sort of unshowy soldiering that didn't win medals but wars.</p>
<p>
Still dazed from the bullet-graze, he had fallen into the car's rear
footwell as it pitched and yawed, caught in the swollen force of the
river. The woman had nearly buried him in the voluminous thick coat.
Stuck like that, head still ringing from the shot that had grazed his
skull, he'd been unable to get a good swing at her. For those absurd,
confined, frustrating minutes, the struggle with the girl had seemed
like a microcosm of the plain-wide muddle his army was now embroiled
in; he had the strength to knock her out cold, but the cramped
battleground and the hiding weight of her enveloping coat had muffled
him and imprisoned him until it was too late.</p>
<p>
The car had hit the concrete island and tipped right over, throwing
them both out onto the corroded grey surface. The woman had given a
little scream; she'd raised the knife that had been caught in the
folds of the green greatcoat all that time, but he had finally got
his clear punch, and connected satisfyingly with her chin.</p>
<p>
She'd thumped back to the concrete; he'd turned round to see the car
scraping off the slipway, torn away by the surging brown tide. Still
on its side, it had sunk almost immediately.</p>
<p>
He'd turned back, and felt tempted to kick the unconscious woman.
He'd kicked the knife instead, sending it whirling away into the
river, following the drowned staff car.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'You won't win,' the woman said, spitting. 'You can't win, against
us.' She shook the little chair, angrily.</p>
<p>
'What?' he said, shaken from his reverie.</p>
<p>
'We'll win,' she said, giving a furious shake that rattled the
chair's legs on the stone floor.</p>
<p>
Why did I tie the silly fool to a chair, of all things? he thought.
'You could well be right,' he told her, tiredly. 'Things are
looking... damp at the moment. Make you feel any better?'</p>
<p>
'You're going to die,' the woman said, staring.</p>
<p>
'Nothing more certain than that,' he agreed, gazing at the leaking
roof above the rag bed.</p>
<p>
'We are invincible. We will never give up.'</p>
<p>
'Well, you've proved fairly vincible before.' He sighed, remembering
the history of this place.</p>
<p>
'We were betrayed!' the woman shouted. 'Our armies never were
defeated; we were -'</p>
<p>
'Stabbed in the back; I know.'</p>
<p>
'Yes! But our spirit will never die. We -'</p>
<p>
'Aw, shut up!' He said, swinging his legs off the narrow bed and
facing the woman. 'I've heard that shit before. &quot;We was robbed.&quot;
&quot;The folks back home let us down.&quot; &quot;The media were
against us.&quot; Shit...' He ran a hand through his wet hair. 'Only
the very young or the very stupid think wars are waged just by the
military. As soon as news travels faster than a despatch rider or a
bird's leg the whole... nation... whatever... is fighting. That's
your spirit; your will. Not the grunt on the ground. If you lose, you
lose. Don't whine about it. You'd have lost this time too if it
hadn't been for this fucking rain.' He held up a hand as the woman
drew breath. 'And no, I don't believe God is on your side.'</p>
<p>
'Heretic!'</p>
<p>
'Thank you.'</p>
<p>
'I hope your children die! Slowly!'</p>
<p>
'Hmm,' he said, 'I'm not sure I qualify, but if I do it'd be a long
spit.' He collapsed back on the bed, then looked aghast, and levered
himself back up again. 'Shit; they really must get to you people
young; that's a terrible thing for anybody to say, let alone a
woman.'</p>
<p>
'Our women are more manly than your <I>men</I>,' the woman sneered.</p>
<p>
'And still you breed. Choice must be limited, I suppose.'</p>
<p>
'May your children suffer and die horribly!' the woman shrieked.</p>
<p>
'Well, if that's really the way you feel,' he sighed, lying back
again, 'then there's nothing worse I can wish on you than to be
exactly the fuckhead you so obviously are.'</p>
<p>
'Barbarian! Infidel!'</p>
<p>
'You'll run out of expletives soon; I'd advise saving some for later.
Not that keeping forces in reserve has ever been precisely you guys'
strong point, has it?'</p>
<p>
'We will crush you!'</p>
<p>
'Hey; I'm crushed, I'm crushed.' He waved one hand languidly. 'Now
back off.'</p>
<p>
The woman howled and shook the small chair.</p>
<p>
Maybe, he thought, I ought to be thankful for the chance to be away
from the responsibilities of command, the minute-to-minute changes in
conditions that the fools couldn't deal with themselves and that
bogged you down as surely as the mud; the continual flood of reports
of units immobilised, washed away, deserting, cut off, retreating
from vital positions, yelling for help, for relief, for
reinforcements, more trucks, more tanks, more rafts, more food, more
radios... past a certain point there was nothing he could do; he
could only acknowledge, reply, turn-down, delay, order to make a
stand; nothing, nothing. The reports kept on coming in, building up
like a one-colour, paper mosaic of a million pieces, the picture of
an army, bit-by-bit disintegrating, softened by the rain just like a
sheet of paper, made soggy and tearable and gradually coming apart.</p>
<p>
That was what he was escaping by being marooned here... yet he was
not secretly thankful, he was not actually glad; he was furious and
angry at being away, at leaving it all in the hands of others, of
being away from the centre, from knowing what was happening. He
fretted like a mother for a young son just marched off to war, driven
to tears or pointless screams for the powerlessness of it, the
heedless unstoppable momentum. (It struck him then that the whole
process didn't really require any enemy forces at all. The battle was
him and the army under his command, against the elements. A third
party was superfluous.)</p>
<p>
First the rains, then their unheard-of severity, then the landslide
that had cut them off from the rest of the command convoy, then this
bedraggled idiot of a would-be assassin...</p>
<p>
He swung back upright again, held his head in his hands.</p>
<p>
Had he tried to do too much? He had had ten hours sleep in the last
week; had that clouded his mind, impaired his judgement? Or had he
slept too much; might that little extra bit of wakefulness have made
all the difference?</p>
<p>
'I hope you die!' the woman's voice squawked.</p>
<p>
He looked at her, frowning, wondering why she had interrupted his
thoughts, wishing she'd shut up. Maybe he should gag her.</p>
<p>
'You're retreating,' he pointed out. 'A minute ago you were telling
me I <I>would</I> die.' He slumped back on the bed.</p>
<p>
'Bastard!' she screamed.</p>
<p>
He looked at her, suddenly thinking that he was as much a prisoner
where he lay as she was where she sat. Snot gathered under her nose
again. He looked away.</p>
<p>
He heard her snort back, then spit. He would have smiled if he'd had
the strength. She showed contempt with a spit; what was her one
dribble compared to the deluge that was drowning a fighting machine
he had worked two years to bring together and train?</p>
<p>
And why, <I>why</I> had he tied her to a chair of all things? Did he
try to make chance and fate redundant by scheming against himself? A
chair; a girl tied to the chajr... about the same age, maybe a little
older... but the same slim figure, with a lying greatcoat that tried
to pretend she was bigger, but failed. About the same age, about the
same shape...</p>
<p>
He shook his head, forcing his thoughts away from that battle, that
failure.</p>
<p>
She saw him look at her and shake his head.</p>
<p>
'Don't you laugh at me!' she screamed, shaking backwards and forwards
in the chair, furious at his scorn.</p>
<p>
'Shut up, shut up,' he said wearily. He knew it wasn't convincing,
but he could not sound any more authoritative.</p>
<p>
She shut up, remarkably.</p>
<p>
The rains, and her; sometimes he wished he did believe in Fate. Maybe
it did sometimes help to believe in Gods. Sometimes - like now, when
things fell against him and every turn he took brought him up against
another vicious twist of the knife, another hammering on the bruises
he'd already collected - it would be comforting to think that it was
all designed, all pre-ordained, all already written, and you just
turned the pages of some great and inviolable book... Maybe you never
did get a chance to write your own story (and so his own name, even
that attempt at terms, mocked him).</p>
<p>
He didn't know what to think; was there as petty and suffocating a
destiny as some people seemed to think?</p>
<p>
He didn't want to be here; he wanted to be back where the busy
to-and-fro of <I>t</I>eport and command stifled all other traffic in
the mind.</p>
<p>
'You're losing; you've lost this battle, haven't you?'</p>
<p>
He considered saying nothing, but on reflection she would take this
as a sign he was weak, and so continue.</p>
<p>
'What a penetrating insight,' he sighed. 'You remind me of some of
the people who planned this war. Cross-eyed, stupid and static.'</p>
<p>
'I'm not cross-eyed!' she screamed, and instantly started crying, her
head forced down by the weight of huge sobs that shook her body and
waved the folds of the coat, making the chair creak.</p>
<p>
Her dirty long hair hid her face, falling from her head over the wide
lapels of the greatcoat; her arms were almost level with the ground,
so far forward had she slumped in her crying. He wanted the strength
to go over and cuddle her, or bash her brains out; anything to stop
her making that unnecessary noise.</p>
<p>
'All right, all right, you haven't got cross-eyes, I'm sorry.'</p>
<p>
He lay back with one arm thrown across his eyes, hoping he sounded
convincing, but sure he sounded as insincere as he was.</p>
<p>
'I don't want your sympathy!'</p>
<p>
'Sorry again; I retract the retraction.'</p>
<p>
'Well... I haven't... It's just a... a slight defect, and it didn't
stop the army board from taking me.'</p>
<p>
(They were also, he recalled, taking children and pensioners, but he
didn't say that to the woman.) She was trying to wipe her face on the
lapels of the greatcoat.</p>
<p>
She sniffed heavily, and when she brought her head back and her hair
swung away, he saw there was a large dew-drop on the tip of her nose.
He got up without thinking - the tiredness shrieking in indignation
- and tore a portion of the thin curtain over the bed-alcove off as
he went over to her.</p>
<p>
She saw him coming with the ragged scrap and screamed with all her
might; she emptied her lungs with the effort of announcing to the
rainy world outside that she was about to be murdered. She was
rocking the chair, and he had to jump at it and land with one boot on
one of the cross-members between the legs to stop it from tipping
over.</p>
<p>
He put the rag over her face.</p>
<p>
She stopped struggling. She went limp, not fighting or squirming but
knowing it was utterly pointless to go on doing anything.</p>
<p>
'Good,' he said, relieved, 'Now, blow.'</p>
<p>
She blew.</p>
<p>
He withdrew the rag, folded it over, put it back over her face and
told her to blow again. She blew again. He folded it over again and
wiped her nose, hard. She squealed; it was sore. He sighed again and
threw the rag away.</p>
<p>
He didn't lie down again because it only made him sleepy and
thoughtful, and he didn't want to sleep because he felt he might
never wake up, and he didn't want to think because it wasn't getting
him anywhere.</p>
<p>
He turned away and stood at the door, which was as close anywhere as
it could be and still half open. Rain spattered in.</p>
<p>
He thought of the others; the other commanders. Damn; the only other
one he trusted was Rogtam-Bar, and he was too junior to take charge.
He hated being put into positions like this, coming in on an already
established command structure, usually corrupt, usually nepotistic,
and having to take so much on himself that any absence, any
hesitation, even any rest, gave the clueless froth-heads around him a
chance to fuck things up even further. But then, he told himself,
what General was ever totally happy with the command he took over?</p>
<p>
Anyway, he hadn't left them enough: a few crazy plans that would
almost certainly never come off; his attempts to use the weapons that
were not obvious. Too much of it was still inside his own head. That
one private place, where he knew even the Culture did not look,
though through their own warped fastidiousness, not through
inability...</p>
<p>
He forgot all about the woman. It was as if she didn't exist when he
wasn't looking at her, and her voice and her attempt to cut herself
free were the results of some absurd supernatural manifestation.</p>
<p>
He opened the cottage door wide. You could see anything in the rain.
The individual drops became streaks with the slowness of the eye;
they merged and re-emerged as cyphers for the shapes you carried
inside you; they lasted less than a heartbeat in your sight and they
went on for ever.</p>
<p>
He saw a chair, and a ship that was not a ship; he saw a man with two
shadows, and he saw that which cannot be seen; a concept; the
adaptive, self-seeking urge to survive, to bend everything that can
be reached to that end, and to remove and to add and to smash and to
create so that one particular collection of cells can go on, can move
onwards and decide, and keeping moving, and keeping deciding, knowing
that - if nothing else - at least it lives.</p>
<p>
And it had two shadows, it was two things; it was the need and it was
the method. The need was obvious; to defeat what opposed its life.
The method was that taking and bending of materials and people to one
purpose, the outlook that everything could be used in the fight;
that nothing could be excluded, that everything was a weapon, and the
ability to handle those weapons, to find them and choose which one to
aim and fire; that talent, that ability, that use of weapons.</p>
<p>
A chair, and a ship that was not a ship, a man with two shadows,
and...</p>
<p>
'What are you going to do with me?' The woman's voice was quivering.
He looked round at her.</p>
<p>
'I don't know; what do you think?'</p>
<p>
She looked at him with her eyes widening, horrified. She seemed to be
gathering her breath for another scream. He didn't understand it;
he'd asked her a perfectly normal, pertinent question and she acted
as if he'd said he was going to kill her.</p>
<p>
'Please don't. Oh please don't, oh please please don't,' she sobbed
again, dryly. Then her back seemed to break, and her imploring face
bowed almost to her knees as she drooped again.</p>
<p>
'Do <I>what</I>?' He was mystified.</p>
<p>
She didn't appear to hear him; she just hung there, her slack body
jerked by her sobs.</p>
<p>
It was at moments like this he stopped understanding people; he just
had no comprehension of what was going on in their minds; they were
denied, unfathomable. He shook his head and started walking round the
room. It was smelly and damp, and it carried this atmosphere as
though this was no innovation. This had always been a hole. Probably
some illiterate had lived here, custodian of the derelict machines
from another, more fabulous age, long-shattered by the conspicuous
love of war these people exhibited; a mean life in an ugly place.</p>
<p>
When would they come? Would they find him? Would they think he was
dead? Had they heard his message on the radio, after the landslide
had cut them off from the rest of the command convoy?</p>
<p>
Had he worked the damn thing right?</p>
<p>
Maybe he hadn't. Maybe he would be left behind; they might think a
search was useless. He hardly cared. It would be no additional pain
to be captured; he'd drowned in that already, in his mind. He could
almost welcome it, if he set his mind to it; he knew he could. All he
needed was the strength to be bothered.</p>
<p>
'If you're going to kill me, please will you do it quickly?'</p>
<p>
He was getting annoyed at these constant interruptions.</p>
<p>
'Well, I wasn't going to kill you, but keep on whining like this and
I may change my mind.'</p>
<p>
'I hate you.' It seemed to be all she could think of.</p>
<p>
'And I hate you too.'</p>
<p>
She started crying again, loudly.</p>
<p>
He looked out into the rain again, and saw the Staberinde.</p>
<p>
Defeat, defeat, the rain whispered; tanks foundering in the mud, the
men giving up under the torrential rain, everything coming to bits.</p>
<p>
And a stupid woman, and a runny nose... He could laugh at it, at the
sharing of time and place between the grand and the petty, the
magnificently vast and the shoddily absurd, like horrified nobility
having to share a carriage with drunk and dirty peasants being sick
over them and copulating under them; the finery and fleas.</p>
<p>
Laugh, that was the only answer, the only reply that couldn't be
bettered or itself laughed down; the lowest of the low of common
denominators.</p>
<p>
'Do you know who I am?' he said, turning suddenly. The thought had
just occurred to him that maybe she didn't realise who he was, and he
wouldn't have been in the least surprised to find out that she had
tried to kill him just because he was in a big car, and not because
she had recognised the Commander-in-Chief of the entire army. He
wouldn't be at all surprised to find that; he almost expected it.</p>
<p>
She looked up. 'What?'</p>
<p>
'Do you know who I am? Do you know my name or rank?'</p>
<p>
'No,' she spat. 'Should I?'</p>
<p>
'No, no,' he laughed, and turned away.</p>
<p>
He looked briefly out at the grey wall of rain, as though it was an
old friend, then turned, went back to the bed and fell onto it again.</p>
<p>
The government wouldn't like it either. Oh, the things he'd promised
them, the riches, the lands, the gains of wealth, prestige and power.
They'd have him shot if the Culture didn't pull him out; they'd see
him dead for this defeat. It would have been their victory but it
would be his defeat. Standard complaint.</p>
<p>
He tried to tell himself that, mostly, he'd won. He knew he had, but
it was only the moments of defeat, the instants of paralysis that
made him really think, and try to join up the weave of his life into
a whole. That was when his thoughts returned to the battleship
Staberinde and what it represented; that was when he thought about
the Chairmaker, and the reverberating guilt behind that banal
description...</p>
<p>
It was a better sort of defeat this time, it was more impersonal. He
was the commander of the army, he was responsible to the government,
and they could remove him; in the final reckoning, then, he was not
responsible; they were. And there was nothing personal in the
conflict. He'd never met the leaders of the enemy; they were
strangers to him; only their military habits and their patterns of
favoured troop movements and types of build-up were familiar. The
cleanness of that schism seemed to soften the rain of blows. A
little.</p>
<p>
He envied people who could be born, be raised, mature with those
around them, have friends, and then settle down in one place with one
set of acquaintances, live ordinary and unspectacular, unrisky lives
and grow old and be replaced, their children coming to see them...
and die old and senile, content with all that had gone before.</p>
<p>
He could never have believed he would ever feel like this, that he
would so ache to be like that, to have despairs just so deep, joys
just so great; to never strain the fabric of life or fate, but to be
minor, unimportant, uninfluential.</p>
<p>
It seemed utterly sweet, infinitely desirable, now and forever,
because once in that situation, once you were there... would you ever
feel the awful need to do as he had done, and try for those heights?
He doubted it. He turned back to look at the woman in the chair.</p>
<p>
But it was pointless, it was stupid; he thought about thoughtless
things. If I were a seabird... but how could <I>you</I> be a seabird?
If you were a seabird your brain would be tiny and stupid and you
would love half-rotted fish guts and tweaking the eyes out of little
grazing animals; you would know no poetry and you could never
appreciate flying as fully as the human on the ground yearning to be
you.</p>
<p>
If you wanted to be a seabird you deserved to be one.</p>
<p>
'Ah! The camp leader and the camp follower. You haven't quite got it
right thought, sir, you're supposed to tie her in the <I>bed</I>...'</p>
<p>
He jumped; spun round, hand going to the holster at his waist.</p>
<p>
Kirive Socroft Rogtam-Bar kicked the door shut and stood shaking rain
from a large shiny cape in the doorway, smiling ironically and
looking annoyingly fresh and handsome considering he'd had no sleep
for days.</p>
<p>
'Bar!' He almost ran to him, they clapped their arms about each other
and laughed.</p>
<p>
'The very same. General Zakalwe; hello there. I wondered if you would
like to join me in a stolen vehicle. I have an Amph outside...'</p>
<p>
'What!' He threw open the door again and looked out onto the waters.
There was a large and battered amphibious truck fifty metres away,
near one of the towering machines.</p>
<p>
'That's one of their trucks,' he laughed.</p>
<p>
Rogtam-Bar nodded unhappily. 'Yes, I'm afraid so. They seem to want
it back, too.'</p>
<p>
'They do?' He laughed again.</p>
<p>
'Yes. By the way, I'm afraid the government has fallen. Forced out of
office.'</p>
<p>
'What? Because of this?'</p>
<p>
'That's the impression I got, I must say. I think they were so busy
blaming you for losing their idiotic war that they didn't realise
people connected them with it as well. Wide asleep as usual.'
Rogtam-Bar smiled. 'Oh; and that manic idea of yours; the commando
squad placing the sink-charges on the Maclin reservoir? It worked.
Sent all that water into the dam and made the thing overflow; didn't
actually break, according to the intelligence reports, but it...
over-topped, is that the expression? Anyway; an awful lot of water
went down the valley and swept away most of the Fifth Army's High
Command... not to mention quite a bit of the Fifth itself, judging
from the bods and tents seen floating past our lines over the last
few hours... And there we all were, thinking you were crazy for
dragging that hydrologist around with the general staff for the past
week.' Rogtam-Bar clapped his gloved hands. 'Whatever. Things must be
serious; there's talk of peace, I'm afraid.' He looked the General up
and down. 'But you'll have to present a prettier picture than that, I
suspect, if you're to start talking terms with our pals on the other
side. You been mud wrestling, General?'</p>
<p>
'Only with my conscience.'</p>
<p>
'Really? Who won?'</p>
<p>
'Well, it was one of those rare occasions when violence really
doesn't solve anything.'</p>
<p>
'I know the scenario well; usually crops up when one is trying to
decide whether to open the next bottle, or not.' Bar nodded at the
door. 'After you.' He produced a large umbrella from within his
cloak, opened it and held it out. 'General; allow me!' Then he looked
into the centre of the room. 'And what about your friend?'</p>
<p>
'Oh.' He looked back at the woman, who had turned herself around and
was staring, horrified, at them. 'Yes, my captive audience.' He
shrugged. 'I've seen stranger mascots; let's take her, too.'</p>
<p>
'Never question the high command,' Bar said. He handed over the
umbrella. 'You take this. I'll take her.' He looked reassuringly at
the woman, tipped his cap. 'Only literally, ma'am.'</p>
<p>
The woman let out a piercing shriek.</p>
<p>
Rogtam-Bar winced. 'Does she do that a lot?' he asked.</p>
<p>
'Yes; and watch her head when you pick her up; near busted my nose.'</p>
<p>
'When it's such an attractive shape already. See you in the Amph,
sir.'</p>
<p>
'Right you are,' he said, manoeuvering the umbrella through the
doorway, and walking down the concrete slope, whistling.</p>
<p>
'Bastard infidel!' the woman in the chair screamed, as Rogtam-Bar
approached her and the chair from behind, cautiously.</p>
<p>
'You're in luck,' he told her. 'I don't normally stop for hitchers.'</p>
<p>
He picked up the chair with the woman in it and took them both down
to the vehicle, where he dumped them in the back.</p>
<p>
She screamed the whole way.</p>
<p>
'Was she this noisy all the time?' Rogtam-Bar asked, as he reversed
the machine back out into the flood. 'Mostly.'</p>
<p>
'I'm surprised you could hear yourself think.' He looked out into the
pouring rain, smiling ruefully.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
In the ensuing peace, he was demoted, and stripped of several medals.
He left later that year, and the Culture didn't seem in the least
displeased with how he'd done.</p>

<p>
The city was built inside a canyon two kilometres deep and ten
across; the canyon wound through the desert for eight hundred
kilometres, a jagged gash in the crust of the planet. The city took
up only thirty of those kilometres.</p>
<p>
He stood on the rimrock, looking inwards, and was confronted by a
staggered confusion of buildings and houses and streets and steps and
storm drains and railway lines, all grey and misty in filmy layers
under a foggy-red setting sun.</p>
<p>
Like slow waters from a broken dam, nebulous rollers of cloud swung
down the canyon; they foundered persistently among the juts and
cracks of the architecture, and seeped away like tired thoughts.</p>
<p>
In a very few places, the topmost buildings had over-reached the
rimrock and spilled onto the desert, but the rest of the city gave
the impression that it lacked the energy or the momentum to proceed
that far, and so had kept within the canyon, sheltered from the
winds and kept temperate by the canyon's own natural microclimate.</p>
<p>
The city, speckled with dim lights, seemed strangely silent and
motionless. He listened hard, and finally caught what sounded like
the high howl of some animal, from deep inside some misty suburb.
Searching the skies, he could see the far specks of circling birds,
wheeling in the still and coldly heavy air. Gliding in the deep
distance over the cluttered terraces, stepped streets and zig-zagging
roads, they were the source of a far, hoarse crying.</p>
<p>
Further down, he saw some silent trains, thin lines of light, slowly
crossing between tunnels. Water showed as black lines, in aqueducts
and canals. Roads ran everywhere, and vehicles crawled along them,
lights like sparks as they scuttled like the tiny prey of the
wheeling birds.</p>
<p>
It was a cold autumn evening, and the air was bitter. He'd taken off
the combat suit and left it in the capsule, which had buried itself
in a sandy hollow. Now he wore the baggy clothes that were popular
here again; they had been in fashion when he'd worked here last time,
and he felt oddly pleased that he'd been away long enough for the
style to cycle round again. He was not superstitious, but the
coincidence amused him.</p>
<p>
He squatted down and touched the rimrock. He lifted a handful of
pebbles and topweeds, then let them sift through his fingers. He
sighed and got to his feet, pulling on gloves, putting on a hat.</p>
<p>
The city was called Solotol, and Tsoldrin Beychae was here.</p>
<p>
He dusted a little sand from his coat - an old raincoat from far
away, and of purely sentimental value - placed a pair of very dark
glasses on his nose, picked up a modest case, and went down into the
city.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Good afternoon, sir. How may I help you?'</p>
<p>
'I'd like your two top floors, please.'</p>
<p>
The clerk looked confused, then leaned forward. 'I'm sorry, sir?'</p>
<p>
'The two top floors of the hotel; I'd like them.' He smiled. 'I
haven't made a reservation; sorry.'</p>
<p>
'Aah...' the clerk said. He appeared a little worried as he looked at
his reflection in the dark glasses. 'The two...?'</p>
<p>
'Not a room, not a suite, not a floor, but two floors, and not any
two floors; the two top floors. If you have any guests presently
occupying any of the rooms in the top two floors, I suggest you ask
them politely to accept a room on another floor; I'll pay their bills
up till now.'</p>
<p>
'I see...' the hotel clerk said. He seemed unsure whether to take all
this seriously or not. 'And... how long was sir thinking of staying?'</p>
<p>
'Indefinitely. I'll pay for a month, in advance. My lawyers will
cable the funds by lunchtime tomorrow.' He opened the case and took
out a wad of paper money, placing it on the desk. I'll pay for one
night in cash, if you like.'</p>
<p>
'I see,' the clerk said, eyes fixed on the money. 'Well, if sir would
like to fill in this form...'</p>
<p>
'Thank you. Also, I'll want an elevator for my personal use, and
access to the roof. I expect a pass key will be the best solution.'</p>
<p>
'Aah. Indeed. I see. Excuse me just a moment, sir.' The clerk went
off to get the manager.</p>
<p>
He negotiated a bulk discount for the two floors, then agreed a fee
for the use of the lift and the roof that brought the deal back to
what it had been in the first place. He just liked haggling.</p>
<p>
'And sir's name?'</p>
<p>
'I'm called Staberinde,' he said.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He chose a suite on the top floor, on a corner which looked out into
the great depth of canyon city. He unlocked all the cupboards and
closets and doors, window shutters, balcony covers and drug cabinets,
and left everything open. He tested the bath in the suite; the water
ran hot. He took a couple of small chairs out of the bedroom, and
another set of four from the lounge, and put them in another suite
alongside. He turned all the lights on, looking at everything.</p>
<p>
He looked at patterns of coverings and curtains and hangings and
carpets, at the murals and paintings on the walls, and at the design
of the furniture. He rang for some food to be delivered, and when it
came, on a small trolley, he pushed the trolley in front of him from
room to room, eating on the move while he wandered through the quiet
spaces of the hotel, gazing all about, and occasionally looking at a
tiny sensor which was supposed to tell him if there were any
surveillance devices around. There weren't.</p>
<p>
He paused at a window, looking out, and rubbed absently at a small
puckered mark on his chest that was not there any more.</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe?' said a tiny voice from his breast. He looked down, took a
thing like a bead out of a shirt pocket. He clipped it to one ear,
taking off his dark glasses and putting them in the pocket instead.</p>
<p>
'Hello.'</p>
<p>
'It's me; Diziet. You all right?'</p>
<p>
'Yeah. I found a place to stay.'</p>
<p>
'Great. Listen; we've found something. It's <I>perfect</I>!'</p>
<p>
'What?' he said, smiling at the excitement in Sma's voice. He pressed
a button to close the curtains.</p>
<p>
'Three thousand years ago here there was a guy who became a famous
poet; wrote on wax tablets set in wooden frames. He did a group of
one hundred short poems he always maintained were the best things he
ever wrote. But he couldn't get them published, and he decided to
become a sculptor instead; he melted the wax from ninety-eight of the
tablets - keeping numbers one and one hundred - to carve a wax model,
made a sand mould around it, and cast a bronze figure which still
exists.'</p>
<p>
'Sma, is this leading anywhere?' he said, pressing another button to
open the curtains again. He rather liked the way they swished.</p>
<p>
'Wait! When we first found Voerenhutz and did the standard total scan
of each planet, we naturally took a holo of the bronze statue; found
some traces of the original casting sand <I>and the wax</I> in a
cranny.</p>
<p>
'And it wasn't the right wax!</p>
<p>
'It didn't match the two surviving tablets! So the GCU waited till it
had finished the total scan and then did some detective work. The guy
who did the bronze, and who had done the poems, later became a monk,
and ended up an abbot of a monastery. There was one building added
while he was head man; legend has it he used to go there and
contemplate the vanished ninety-eight poems. The building has a
double wall.' Sma's voice rose triumphantly; 'Guess what's in the
cavity!'</p>
<p>
'Walled-in disobedient monks?'</p>
<p>
'The poems! The waxes!' Sma yelled. Then her voice dropped a little.
'Well, most of them. The monastery was abandoned a couple of hundred
years ago, and it looks like some shepherd lit a fire against a wall
sometime and melted three or four of them... but the rest are <I>there</I>!'</p>
<p>
'Is that good?'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe; they're one of the great lost literary treasures of the
planet! The university of Jarnsaromol, where your pal Beychae's
hanging out, has most of the guy's parchment manuscripts, the other
two tablets <I>and</I> the famous bronze. They'd give <I>anything to</I>
get their hands on those tablets! Don't you see? It's perfect!'</p>
<p>
'Sounds all right, I suppose.'</p>
<p>
'Damn you, Zakalwe! Is that all you can say?'</p>
<p>
'Dizzy, luck this good never lasts long; it'll average out.'</p>
<p>
'Don't be so pessimistic, Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
'Okay, I won't,' he sighed, closing the curtains again.</p>
<p>
There was a noise of exasperation from Diziet Sma. 'Well; I just
thought I'd tell you. We'll be going soon. Sleep well.'</p>
<p>
The channel beeped closed. He smiled ruefully. He left the little
terminal where it was, like an earring.</p>
<p>
He gave orders he was not to be disturbed, and as the night deepened,
he turned all the heating up full and opened all the windows. He
spent some time testing the balconies and drainage pipes around the
outer walls; he climbed nearly to the ground and all the way round
the facade as he tested ledges and pipes and sills and cornices for
their strength. He saw lights in less than a dozen other guest rooms.
When he was satisfied he knew the outside of the hotel, he returned
to his floor.</p>
<p>
He leant on the balcony, a smoky bowl cradled in his hand.
Occasionally he lifted the bowl to his face and inhaled deeply; the
rest of the time he looked out over the sparkling city, whistling.</p>
<p>
Watching the light-speckled view, he thought while most cities looked
like canvases, spread flat and thin, Solotol was like a half-open
book; a rippling sculptured V sinking deep into the planet's
geological past. Above, the clouds over the canyon and the desert
glowed with orange-red light, reflecting the channelled flare of the
city.</p>
<p>
He imagined that from the other side of the city, the hotel must look
rather strange, with its topmost floor fully lit, the others
practically black.</p>
<p>
He supposed he had forgotten how different the setting of the canyon
made the city, compared to others. Still, this too is similar, he
thought. All is similar.</p>
<p>
He had been to so many different places and seen so much the same and
so much utterly different that he was amazed by both phenomena... but
it was true; this city was not so different from many others he'd
known.</p>
<p>
Everywhere they found themselves, the galaxy bubbled with life and
its basic foods kept on speaking back to it, just like he'd told
Shias Engin (and, thinking of her, felt again the texture of her skin
and the sound of her voice). Still, he suspected if the Culture had
really wanted to, it could have found far more spectacularly
different and exotic places for him to visit. Their excuse was that
he was a limited creature, adapted to certain sorts of planets and
societies and types of warfare. A martial niche, Sma had called it.</p>
<p>
He smiled a little grimly, and took another deep breath from the drug
bowl.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The man walked past empty arcades and deserted flights of steps. He
wore an old raincoat of a style unknown but still somehow
old-fashioned looking; he wore very dark glasses. His walk was
economical. He appeared to have no mannerisms.</p>
<p>
He entered the courtyard of a large hotel which contrived to look
expensive and slightly run-down at the same time. Dully-dressed
gardeners, raking leaves from the surface of an old swimming pool,
stared at the man as though he had no right to be there.</p>
<p>
Men were painting the interior of the porch outside the lobby, and he
had to work his way round them to get in. The painters were using
specially inferior paint made to very old recipes; it was guaranteed
to fade and crack and peel in a most authentic manner within a year
or two.</p>
<p>
The foyer was rich with decoration. The man pulled a thick purple
rope near one corner of the reception desk. The clerk appeared,
smiling.</p>
<p>
'Good morning, Mr Staberinde. A pleasant walk?'</p>
<p>
'Yes, thank you. Have breakfast sent up, will you?'</p>
<p>
'Immediately, sir.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Solotol is a city of arches and bridges, where steps and pavements
wind past tall buildings and lance out over steep rivers and gullies
on slender suspension bridges and fragile stone arches. Roadways flow
along the banks of water courses, looping and twisting over and under
them; railways splay out in a tangle of lines and levels, swirling
through a network of tunnels and caverns where underground
reservoirs and roads converge, and from a speeding train passengers
can look out to see galaxies of lights reflecting on stretches of
dark water crossed by the slants of underground funiculars and the
piers and ways of subterranean roads.' 
</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He was sitting in the bed, dark glasses on the other pillow, eating
breakfast and watching the hotel's own introductory tape on the suite
screen. He switched the sound down when the antique telephone beeped.</p>
<p>
'Hello?'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe?' It was Sma's voice.</p>
<p>
'Good grief; you still here?'</p>
<p>
'We're about to break orbit.'</p>
<p>
'Well, don't wait on my account.' He felt inside a shirt pocket and
fished out the terminal bead. 'Why the phone? This transceiver packed
up?'</p>
<p>
'No; just making sure there are no problems patching into the phone
system.'</p>
<p>
'Fine. That all?'</p>
<p>
'No. We've located Beychae more exactly; still in Jarnsaromol
University, but he's in library annexe four. That's a hundred metres
under the city; the university's safest safe store. Quite secure at
the best of times, and they have extra guards, though no real
military.'</p>
<p>
'But where does he live; where does he sleep?'</p>
<p>
'The curator's apartments; they're attached to the library.'</p>
<p>
'He ever come to the surface?'</p>
<p>
'Not that we can find out.'</p>
<p>
He whistled. 'Well, that might or might not be a problem.'</p>
<p>
'How are things at your end?'</p>
<p>
'Fine,' he said, biting into a sweetmeat. 'Just waiting for the
offices to open; I've left a message with the lawyers to phone me.
Then I start causing a fuss.'</p>
<p>
'All right. There shouldn't be any problems there; the necessary
instructions have been issued, and you should get anything you want.
Any problems, get in touch and we'll fire off an indignant cable.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah, Sma, I've been thinking; just how big is this Culture
commercial empire, this Vanguard Corporation?'</p>
<p>
'Vanguard <I>Foundation.</I> It's big enough.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah, but how big? How far can I go?'</p>
<p>
'Well, don't buy anything bigger than a country. Look, Cheradenine;
be as extravagant as you want in creating your fuss. Just get Beychae
for us. Quickly.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah, yeah; okay.'</p>
<p>
'We're heading off now, but we'll keep in touch. Remember; we're here
to help if you need it.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah. Bye.' He put the phone down and turned the screen sound up
again.</p>
<p>
'Caves, natural and artificial, are scattered through the rock of the
canyon walls in almost as great a profusion as the buildings on the
sloping surface. Many of the city's old hydroelectric sources are
there, hollowed out into rock and humming; and a few small factories
and workshops still survive, hidden away beneath the cliffs and
shale, with only their stubby chimneys on the desert surface to show
their position. This upward river of warm fumes counterpoints the
network of sewage and drainage pipes, which also shows on the surface
on occasion, and presents a complex pattern of tracery through the
fabric of the city.'</p>
<p>
The phone beeped.</p>
<p>
'Hello?'</p>
<p>
'Mr... Staberinde?'</p>
<p>
'Yes.'</p>
<p>
'Ah, yes; good morning. My name is Kiaplor, of...'</p>
<p>
'Ah; the lawyers.'</p>
<p>
'Yes. Thank you for your message. I have here a cable granting you
full access to the income and securities of the Vanguard Foundation.'</p>
<p>
'I know. Are you quite happy with this, Mr Kiaplor?'</p>
<p>
'Umm... I... yes; the cable makes the position quite clear... though
it is an unprecedented degree of individual discretion, given the
size of the account. Not that the Vanguard Foundation has ever
behaved exactly conventionally at any time.'</p>
<p>
'Good. The first thing I'd like is to have funds sufficient to cover
a month's hire of two floors of the Excelsior transferred to the
hotel's account, immediately. Then I want to start buying a few
things.'</p>
<p>
'Ah... yes. Such as?'</p>
<p>
He dabbed at his lips with a napkin. 'Well, for a start, a street.'</p>
<p>
'A street?'</p>
<p>
'Yes. Nothing too ostentatious, and it doesn't have to be very long,
but I want a whole street, somewhere near the city centre. Do you
think you can look for a suitable one, immediately?'</p>
<p>
'Ah... well, yes, we can certainly start looking. I...'</p>
<p>
'Good. I'll call at your offices in two hours; I'd like to be in a
position to come to a decision then.'</p>
<p>
'Two...? Umm... well, ah...'</p>
<p>
'Speed is essential, Mr Kiaplor. Put your best people on it.'</p>
<p>
'Yes. Very well.'</p>
<p>
'Good. I'll see you in a couple of hours.'</p>
<p>
'Yes. Right. Goodbye.' He turned the screen sound back up again.</p>
<p>
'Very little new building has been done for hundreds of years;
Solotol is a monument, an institution; a museum. The factories, like
the people, are mostly gone. Three universities lend areas of the
city some life, during part of the year, but the general air is said
by many people to be archaic, even stultified, though some people
enjoy the feel of living in what is, in effect, the past. Solotol has
no sky-lighting; the trains still run on metal rails, and the ground
vehicles must remain on the ground, because flying within the city or
immediately above it is banned. A sad old place, in many ways; large
sections of the city are uninhabited or only occupied for part of the
year. The city is still a capital in name, but it does not represent
the culture to which it belongs; it is an exhibit, and while many
come to visit it, few choose to stay.'</p>
<p>
He shook his head, put his dark glasses on, and turned the screen
off.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
When the wind was in the right direction he blasted huge netted balls
of paper money into the air from an old firework mortar mounted in a
high roof garden; the notes drifted down like early snowflakes. He'd
had the street decorated with bunting, streamers and balloons and
filled with tables and chairs and bars serving free drink; covered
ways extended the length of it and music played; there were brightly
coloured canopies over the important areas, such as the bandstands
and the bars, but they were not needed; the day was bright, and
unseasonably warm. He looked out of one of the highest windows in one
of the tallest buildings in the street, and smiled at the sight of
all the folk.</p>
<p>
So little happened in the city during the off season that the
carnival had attracted instant attention. He had hired people to
serve the drugs and food and drink he had laid on; he had banned cars
and unhappy faces, and people who didn't smile when they tried to get
into the street were made to wear funny masks until they had livened
up a bit. He breathed in deeply from where he leaned on the high
window, and his lungs soaked up the heady fumes of a very busy bar
just below; the drug smoke made it just this far up and hung in a
cloud. He smiled, found it very heartening; it was all perfect.</p>
<p>
People walked around and talked together or in groups, exchanging
their smoky bowls, laughing and smiling. They listened to the band
and watched people dancing. They gave a great cheer each time the
mortar fired. Many of them laughed at the leaflets full of political
jokes that were given out with every bowl of drugs or food and every
mask and novelty; they laughed too at the big, guady banners that
were strung across the fronts of the dilapidated old buildings and
across the street itself. The banners were either absurd or humorous,
too. PACIFISTS AGAINST WALLS! and, EXPERTS? WHAT DO THEY KNOW? were
two of the more translatable examples.</p>
<p>
There were games and trials of wit or strength, there were free
flowers and party hats and a much frequented Compliments stall where
one paid a little money, or gave a paper hat or whatever, and was
told what a nice, pleasant, good, unshowy, quiet-tempered,
undemonstrative, restrained, sincere, respectful, handsome, cheerful,
good-willed person one was.</p>
<p>
He looked down on all of this, shades pushed up onto the tied-back
hair above his forehead. Down there, submerged in it, he knew he
would feel somehow apart from it all. But from his high vantage point
he could look down and see the people as a mass with different faces;
they were far enough away to present a single theme, close enough to
introduce their own harmonious variations. They enjoyed themselves,
were made to laugh or to giggle, encouraged to get drugged and silly,
captivated by the music, slightly deranged by the atmosphere.</p>
<p>
He watched two people in particular.</p>
<p>
They were a man and a woman, walking slowly through the street,
looking all around. The man was tall and had dark hair cut short and
kept artificially unkempt and curly; he was smartly dressed and
carried a small dark beret in one hand; a mask dangled from the
other.</p>
<p>
The woman was almost as tall, and slimmer. She was dressed like the
man, in unfussy dark grey-black, with a mandala of pleated white at
her neck. Her hair was black, shoulder-length, and quite straight.
She walked as though there were many admiring people watching her.</p>
<p>
They walked side by side, without touching each other; they spoke now
and again, merely tipping their heads in the direction of their
companion and looking to the other side, perhaps at what they were
talking about, as they spoke.</p>
<p>
He thought he remembered their photographs from one of the briefings
on the GSV. He moved his head a little to one side, to make sure the
earring terminal had a good shot of them, then told the tiny machine
to record the view.</p>
<p>
A few moments later, the two people disappeared beneath the banners
at the far end of the street; they'd walked through the carnival
without taking part in anything.</p>
<p>
The street party went on; a small shower came and drove people under
the awnings and covers and into some of the small houses, but it was
short, and more people were coming all the time; small children ran
with bright streamers of paper, winding coloured trails round posts
and people and stalls and tables. Puff-bombs exploded in smoky balls
of coloured incense, and laughing, choking people staggered about,
thumping each others' backs and shouting at the laughing children who
threw the things.</p>
<p>
He drew away from the window, losing interest. He sat in the room for
a little, squatting on an old chest in the dust, hand rubbing his
chin, thoughtful, only raising his eyes when an upward landslide of
balloons jostled up past the casement. He brought the dark glasses
down. From inside, the balloons looked just the same.</p>
<p>
He walked down the narrow stairs, his boots clacking on the old wood;
he took the old raincoat up from the rail at the bottom, and let
himself out of the rear door into another street.</p>
<p>
The driver pulled the car away and he sat in the back as they rolled
past the rows of old buildings. They came to the end of the street
and turned into the steep road that ran at right-angles to it and the
street the party was in. They slid past a long dark car with the man
and the woman in it.</p>
<p>
He looked round. The dark car followed them.</p>
<p>
He told the driver to exceed the speed limit. They sped, and the car
following them kept pace. He hung on and watched the city slithering
past. They raced through some of the old government areas; the grand
buildings were grey, and heavily decorated with wall founts and water
channels; elaborate patterns of water ran down their walls in
vertical waves, dropping like theatre curtains. There were some
weeds, but less than he would have expected. He couldn't remember if
they let the water-walls ice up, turned them off, or added
antifreeze. Scaffolding hung from many of the buildings. Workmen
scratched and scraped at the worn stones, and turned to watch the two
big cars go tearing through the squares and plazas.</p>
<p>
He clung on to a grab handle in the rear of the car, and sorted
through a large collection of keys.</p>
<p>
They stopped in an old narrow street, down near the banks of the
great river itself. He got out smartly and hurried into a small
entrance under a tall building. The following car roared into the
street as he closed but did not lock the door. He went down some
steps, unlocking several rusting sets of gates. When he got down to
the bottom of the building he found the funicular car waiting on the
platform. He opened the door, got in and pulled the lever.</p>
<p>
There was a slight jerk as the car started off up the incline, but it
ran smoothly enough. He watched through the back windows as the man
and then the woman came out onto the platform. He smiled as they
looked up and saw the car disappearing into the tunnel. The little
coach struggled up the smooth slope into the daylight.</p>
<p>
At the point where the uphill and the downhill coach passed each
other, he got out onto the outer platform of the car and stepped over
onto the downhill coach. It ran on, propelled by the extra weight of
water that it carried in its tanks, picked up from the stream at the
high terminal of the old line. He waited a bit, then jumped out of
that car about a quarter of the way down, onto the step? at the side
of the track. He climbed up a long metal ladder, into another
building.</p>
<p>
He was sweating slightly by the time he got to the top. He took off
the old raincoat and walked back to the hotel with it over his arm.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The room was very white and modern-looking, with large windows. The
furniture was integrated with the plasticised walls, and light came
from bulges in the one-piece roof. A man stood watching the first
snow of winter as it fell softly over the grey city; it was late
afternoon, and getting dark quickly. On a white couch a woman lay
face-down, her elbows spread out, but her hands together under her
side-turned face. Her eyes were closed and her pale, oiled body was
massaged with apparent roughness by a powerfully-built man with grey
hair and facial scars.</p>
<p>
The man at the window watched the falling snow in two ways. First as
a mass, with his eyes on one static point, so that the snowflakes
became a mere swirl and the currents of air and gusts of light wind
that moved them became manifest in patterns of circling, spiralling,
falling. Then, by looking at the snow as individual flakes, selecting
one high in the indeterminate galaxy of grey on grey, he saw one
path, one separate way down through all the quiet hurry of the fall.</p>
<p>
He watched them as they hit the black sill outside, where they grew
steadily but imperceptibly to form a soft white ledge. Others struck
the window itself, sticking there briefly, then falling away, blown
off.</p>
<p>
The woman seemed asleep. She smiled slightly, and the exact geography
of her face was altered by the forces that the grey-haired man
exerted on her back, shoulders and flanks. Her oiled flesh moved this
way and that, and the gliding fingers seemed to provide force without
causing friction, ribbing and creasing the skin like the smooth
action of the sea on underwater grass. Her buttocks were covered by
a black towel, her hair was loose and spilling over pan of her face,
and her pale breasts were long ovals squashed beneath her trim body.</p>
<p>
'What is to be done, then?'</p>
<p>
'We need to know more.'</p>
<p>
'That is always true. Back to the problem.'</p>
<p>
'We could have him deported.'</p>
<p>
'For what?'</p>
<p>
'We need to give no reason, though we could invent one easily
enough.'</p>
<p>
'That might start the war before we are ready for it.'</p>
<p>
'Shush now; we must not talk of this &quot;war&quot; thing. We are
officially on the best of terms with all our Federation members;
there is no need for worry. Everything is under control.'</p>
<p>
'Said an official spokesperson... Do you think we should get rid of
him?'</p>
<p>
'It may be the wisest course. One might feel better with him out of
the way... I have a horrible feeling he must be here for a purpose.
He has been given full use of the Vanguard Foundation's monies, and
that... wilfully mysterious organisation has opposed us every step
along the road for thirty years. The identity and location of its
owners and executives have been one of the cluster's best-kept
secrets; unparalleled reserve. Now - suddenly - this man appears,
spending with a quite vulgar profligacy and maintaining a high, if
still coquettishly shy, profile... just when it might prove extremely
awkward.'</p>
<p>
'Perhaps he is the Vanguard Foundation.'</p>
<p>
'Nonsense. If it's anything appreciable at all, it's some
interfering aliens, or a do-good machine, either running on some
dead magnate's conscience will - or even running with a
transcription of a human personality - or it's a rogue machine,
accidentally conscious with no-one to oversee it. I think every other
possibility has been discounted over the years. This man Staberinde
is a puppet; he spends money with the desperation of an indulged
child worried such generosity will not last. He's like a peasant
winning a lottery. Revolting. But he must - I repeat - be here for a
purpose.'</p>
<p>
'If we kill him, and he turns out to have been important, then we
might start a war, and too early.'</p>
<p>
'Perhaps, but I feel we must do what is not expected. To prove our
humanity, to exploit our intrinsic advantage over the machines, if
for no other reason.'</p>
<p>
'Indeed, but isn't it possible he could be of use to us?'</p>
<p>
'Yes.'</p>
<p>
The man at the window smiled at his reflection in the glass and
tapped out a little rhythm on the inside sill.</p>
<p>
The woman on the couch kept her eyes closed, her body moving to the
steady beat of the hands that plied her waist and flanks.</p>
<p>
'But wait. There were links between Beychae and the Vanguard
Foundation. If this is so...'</p>
<p>
'If this is so... then perhaps we can persuade Beychae to our side,
using this person, this Staberinde.' The man put his finger to the
glass and traced the path of a snowflake, drifting down the other
side. His eyes crossed as he watched it.</p>
<p>
'We could...'</p>
<p>
'What?'</p>
<p>
'Adopt the Dehewwoff system.'</p>
<p>
'The...? Need to know more.'</p>
<p>
The Dehewwoff system of punishing by disease; graded capital
punishment; the more serious the crime the more serious the disease
the culprit is infected with. For minor crimes a mere fever, loss of
livelihood and medical expenses; for more damaging misdeeds a bout of
something lasting perhaps months, with pain and a long convalescence,
bills and no sympathy, sometimes marks to show later on. For really
ghastly crimes, infection with diseases rarely survived; near certain
death but possible divine intervention and miracle cure. Of course,
the lower one's class, the more virulent one's punishment, to allow
for the hardier constitutions of the toilers. Combinations, and
recurring strains, provide sophistications to the basic idea.'</p>
<p>
'Back to the problem.'</p>
<p>
'And I <I>hate</I> those dark glasses.'</p>
<p>
'I repeat; back to the problem.'</p>
<p>
'... we need to know more.'</p>
<p>
'So they all say.'</p>
<p>
'And I think we should speak to him.'</p>
<p>
'Yes. <I>Then</I> we kill him.'</p>
<p>
'Restraint. We speak to him. We shall find him again and ask him what
he wants and perhaps who he is. We shall keep quiet and be thoughtful
and we shall not kill him unless he needs to be killed.'</p>
<p>
'We nearly spoke to him.'</p>
<p>
'No sulking. It was preposterous. We are not here to chase cars and
run after idiot recluses. We plan. We think. We shall send a note to
the gentleman's hotel...'</p>
<p>
'The Excelsior. Really, one would have hoped such a respected
establishment might not have been so easily seduced by mere money.'</p>
<p>
'Indeed; and then we shall go to him, or have him come to us.'</p>
<p>
'Well, we certainly ought <I>not</I> to go to him. And as for him
coming to us, he may refuse. Regret that... Due to an unforeseen...
A previous commitment prevents... Feel it would be unwise at this
juncture, perhaps another... Can you imagine how humiliating that
would be?'</p>
<p>
'Oh, all right. We'll kill him.'</p>
<p>
'All right we'll <I>try</I> to kill him. If he survives we shall talk
to him. If he survives he will want to talk to us. Commendable plan.
Must agree. No question, left no choice; mere formality.'</p>
<p>
The woman fell silent. The grey-haired man heaved at her hips with
his great hands, and strange patterns of sweat broke from the
unscarred areas of his face; the hands swirled and swept over the
woman's rump, and she bit her bottom lip just a little as her body
moved in a sweet impersonation, flat beat on a white plain. Snow was
falling.</p>

<p>
'You know,' he told the rock, 'I've got this really nasty feeling
that I'm dying... but then all my feelings are pretty nasty at the
moment, come to think of it. What do you think?'</p>
<p>
The rock didn't say anything.</p>
<p>
He had decided that the rock was the centre of the universe, and he
could prove it, but the rock just didn't want to accept its obviously
important place in the overall scheme of things, at least not yet
anyway, so he was left talking to himself. Or he could talk to the
birds and the insects.</p>
<p>
Everything wavered again. Things like waves, like clouds of carrion
birds, closed in on him, centring, zeroing, trapping his mind and
picking it off like a rotten fruit under a machine-gun.</p>
<p>
He tried to crawl away unobtrusively; he could see what was coming
next; his life was going to flash before him. What an appalling
thought.</p>
<p>
Mercifully, only bits of it came back to him, as if the images
mirrored his smashed body, and he remembered things like sitting in a
bar on a little planet, his dark glasses making strange patterns with
the darkened window; he remembered a place where the wind was so bad
they used to judge its severity by the number of trucks that got
blown over each night; he remembered a tank battle in the great
monoculture fields like seas of grass, all madness and submerged
desperation and commanders standing on the tanks and the areas of
burning crop, slowly spreading, burning through the night, spreading
darkness ringed by fire... the cultivated grassland was the reason
for and prize of that war, and was destroyed by it; he remembered a
hose playing under searchlit water, its silent coils writhing; he
remembered the never-ending whiteness and the attritional tectonics
of the crashing tabular bergs, the bitter end of a century's slow
sleep.</p>
<p>
And a garden. He remembered the garden. And a chair.</p>
<p>
'Scream!' he screamed, and started flapping his arms about, trying to
work up enough of a run to get into the air and away from... from...
he hardly knew. He hardly moved, either; his arms flapped a little
and scraped a few more guano pellets away, but the ring of patient
birds clustered around him, waiting for him to die, just looked on,
unfooled, at this display of inadequately avian behaviour.</p>
<p>
'Oh all right,' he mumbled, and collapsed back, clutching his chest
and staring into the bland blue sky. What was so terrible about a
chair, anyway? He started crawling again.</p>
<p>
He hauled himself around the little puddle, scraping his way through
the dark pellets the birds had left, then at a certain point set off
towards the waters of the lake. He got only so far, then stopped,
turned back, and went on round the puddle again, scraping aside the
black bird-shit pellets, apologising to the little insects he
disturbed as he did so. When he got back to the place where he'd been
earlier, he stopped and took stock.</p>
<p>
The warm breeze brought the smell of sulphur from the lake to him...
And he was back in the garden again, remembering the smell of
flowers.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Once there had been a great house which stood in an estate bordered
on three sides by a broad river, mid-way between the mountains and
the sea. The grounds were full of old woods and well-grazed pasture
land; there were rolling hills full of shy, wild animals, and winding
paths and winding streams crossed by little bridges; there were
follies and pergolas and ha-has, ornamental lakes and quiet, rustic
summerhouses.</p>
<p>
Over the years and the generations, many children were born and
brought up in the great house, and played in the wonderful gardens
that surrounded it, but there were four in particular whose story
became important for people who had never seen the house, or heard of
the family's name. Two of the children were sisters, called Darckense
and Livueta; one of the boys was their elder brother, called
Cheradenine, and they all shared the family name; Zakalwe. The last
child was not related to them, but came from a family that had long
been allied to theirs; he was called Elethiomel.</p>
<p>
Cheradenine was the older boy; he could just remember the fuss when
Elethiomel's mother came to the great house, large with child, in
tears, and surrounded by fussing servants and huge guards and weeping
maids. For a few days the attention of the whole house seemed to be
centred on the woman with the child in her womb, and - though his
sisters played happily on, glad of the lessened watchfulness of their
nannies and guards - he already resented the unborn infant.</p>
<p>
The troop of royal cavalry came to the house a week later, and he
remembered his father out on the broad steps leading down into the
courtyard, talking calmly, his own men running quietly through the
house, taking up positions at every window. Cheradenine ran to find
his mother; as he ran through the corridors, he put one hand out in
front of him, as though holding reins, and with his other hand
slapped one hip, making a one-two-three, one-two-three clopping
noise, pretending he was a cavalryman. He discovered his mother with
the woman who had the child inside her; the woman was crying and he
was told to go away.</p>
<p>
The boy was born that night, to the sound of screams.</p>
<p>
Cheradenine noticed that the atmosphere in the house changed greatly
after that, and everyone was at once even more busy than before but
less worried.</p>
<p>
For a few years he could torment the younger boy, but then
Elethiomel, who grew faster than he did, started to retaliate, and an
uneasy truce developed between the two boys. Tutors taught them, and
Cheradenine gradually came to realise that Elethiomel was their
favourite, always learning things more quickly than he did, always
being praised for his abilities developing so early, always being
called advanced and bright and clever. Cheradenine tried hard to
match him, and gleaned a little recognition for not just giving up,
but it never seemed that he was really appreciated. Their martial
instructors were more evenly divided on their merits; Cheradenine was
better at wrestling and strike-fighting; Elethiomel the more
accomplished with gun and blade (under proper supervision; the boy
could get carried away sometimes), though Cheradenine was perhaps his
equal with a knife.</p>
<p>
The two sisters loved them both, regardless, and they played through
the long summers and the brief, cold winters, and - apart from the
first year, after Elethiomel was born - spent a little of each spring
and autumn in the big city, far down the river, where the parents of
Darckense, Livueta and Cheradenine kept a tall town house. None of
the children liked the place, though; its garden was so small and the
public parks so crowded. Elethiomel's mother was always quieter when
they went to the city, and cried more often, and went away for a few
days every so often, all excited before she went, then sobbing when
she returned.</p>
<p>
They were in the city once, one fall, and the four children were
keeping out of the way of the short-tempered adults when a messenger
came to the house.</p>
<p>
They couldn't help but hear the screams, and so abandoned their toy
war and ran out of the nursery onto the landing to peer through the
railings down into the great hall, where the messenger stood, head
down, and Elethiomel's mother screamed and shrieked. Cheradenine,
Livueta and Darckense's mother and father both held onto her, talking
calmly. Finally, their father motioned the messenger away, and the
hysterical woman slumped silent to the floor, a piece of paper
crumpled in her hand.</p>
<p>
Father looked up then, and saw the children, but looked at
Elethiomel, not at Cheradenine. They were all sent to bed soon after.</p>
<p>
When they returned to the house in the country a few days later,
Elethiomel's mother was crying all the time, and did not come down
for meals.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Your father was a murderer. They put him to death because he killed
lots of people.' Cheradenine sat with his legs dangling over the edge
of the stone bulwark. It was a beautiful day in the garden and the
trees sighed in the wind. The sisters were laughing and giggling in
the background, collecting flowers from the beds in the centre of the
stone boat. The stone ship sat in the west lake, joined to the garden
by a short stone causeway. They had played pirates for a while, and
then started investigating the flower beds on the upper of the boat's
two decks. Cheradenine had a collection of pebbles by his side, and
was throwing them, one at a time, down into the calm water, producing
ripples that looked like an archery target as he tried always to hit
the same place.</p>
<p>
'He didn't do any of those things,' Elethiomel said, kicking the
stone bulwark, looking down. 'He was a good man.'</p>
<p>
'If he was good, why did the King have him killed?'</p>
<p>
'I don't know. People must have told tales about him. Told lies.'</p>
<p>
'But the King's clever,' Cheradenine said triumphantly, throwing
another pebble into the spreading circles of waves. 'Cleverer than
anybody. That's why he's king. He'd <I>know</I> if they were telling
lies.'</p>
<p>
'I don't care,' Elethiomel insisted. 'My father wasn't a bad man.'</p>
<p>
'He was, and your mother must have been <I>extremely</I> naughty too,
or they wouldn't have made her stay in her room all this time.'</p>
<p>
'She hasn't been bad!' Elethiomel looked up at the other boy, and
felt something build up inside his head, behind his nose and eyes.
'She's ill. She can't leave her room!'</p>
<p>
'That's what she says,' Cheradenine said.</p>
<p>
'Look! <I>Millions</I> of flowers! Look; we're going to make perfume!
Do you want to help?' The two sisters ran up behind them, arms full
of flowers. 'Elly...' Darckense tried to take Elethiomel's arm.</p>
<p>
He pushed her away.</p>
<p>
'Oh, Elly... Sheri, please don't,' Livueta said.</p>
<p>
'She hasn't been bad!' he shouted at the other boy's back.</p>
<p>
'Yes she ha-as,' Cheradenine said, in a sing-song voice, and flicked
another pebble into the lake.</p>
<p>
'She <I>hasn't</I>!' Elethiomel screamed, and ran forward, pushing
the other boy hard in the back.</p>
<p>
Cheradenine yelled and fell off the carved bulwark; his head struck
the stonework as he fell. The two girls screamed.</p>
<p>
Elethiomel leant over the parapet and saw Cheradenine splash into the
centre of his many-layered circle of waves. He disappeared, came back
up again, and floated face down.</p>
<p>
Darckense screamed.</p>
<p>
'Oh, Elly, no!' Livueta dropped all her flowers and ran towards the
steps. Darckense kept on screaming and squatted down on her haunches,
back against the stone bulwark, crushing her flowers to her chest.
'Darkle! Run to the house!' Livueta cried from the staircase.</p>
<p>
Elethiomel watched the figure in the water move weakly, producing
bubbles, as Livueta's steps sounded slapping on the deck underneath.</p>
<p>
A few seconds before the girl jumped into the shallow water to haul
her brother out, and while Darckense screamed on, Elethiomel swept
the remaining pebbles off the parapet, sending them pattering and
plopping into the water around the boy.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
No, that wasn't it. It had to be something worse than that, didn't
it? He was sure he remembered something about a chair (he remembered
something about a boat too, but that didn't seem to be quite it
either). He tried to think of all the nastiest things that could
happen in a chair, dismissed them one by one as they hadn't happened
to him or to anybody he knew - at least as far as he could remember -
and finally concluded that his fixation on the idea of a chair was a
random thing; it just so happened to be a chair and that was all
there was to it.</p>
<p>
Then there were the names; names that he'd used; pretend names that
didn't really belong to him. Imagine calling himself after a <I>ship</I>!
What a silly person, what a naughty boy; that was what he was trying
to <I>forget.</I> He didn't know, he didn't understand how he could
have been so stupid; now it all seemed so clear, so obvious. He
wanted to forget about the ship; he wanted to bury the thing, so he
shouldn't go calling himself after it.</p>
<p>
Now he realised, <I>now</I> he understood, now when it was too late
to do anything about it.</p>
<p>
Ah, he made himself want to be sick.</p>
<p>
A chair, a ship, a... something else; he forgot.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The boys learned metalwork, the girls pottery.</p>
<p>
'But we're not peasants, or... or...'</p>
<p>
'Artisans,' Elethiomel provided.</p>
<p>
'You will not argue, and you shall learn something of what it is to
work with materials,' Cheradenine's father told the two boys.</p>
<p>
'But it's common!'</p>
<p>
'So is learning how to write, and to work with numbers. Proficiency
in those skills will not make you clerks any more than working with
iron will make you blacksmiths.'</p>
<p>
'But...'</p>
<p>
'You will do as you are told. If it is more in accord with the
martial ambitions you both lay claim to, you may attempt to construct
blades and armour in the course of your lessons.'</p>
<p>
The boys looked at each other.</p>
<p>
'You might also care to tell your language tutor that I instructed
you to ask him whether it is acceptable for young men of breeding to
begin almost every sentence with the unfortunate word, &quot;But&quot;.
That is all.'</p>
<p>
'Thank you, sir.'</p>
<p>
'Thank you, sir.'</p>
<p>
Outside, they agreed that metalwork might not be so bad after all.
'But we've got to tell Big-nose about saying &quot;But&quot;. We'll
get lines!'</p>
<p>
'No we won't. Your old man said that we <I>might</I> care to tell
Big-nose; that's not the same as actually <I>telling</I> us to tell
him.'</p>
<p>
'Ha. Yeah.'</p>
<p>
Livueta wanted to take up metalwork too, but her father would not
allow her to; it was not seemly. She persevered. He would not relent.
She sulked. They compromised, on carpentry.</p>
<p>
The boys made knives and swords, Darckense pots, and Livueta the
furniture for a summerhouse, deep in the estate. It was in that
summerhouse where Cheradenine discovered...</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
No no no, he didn't want to think about that, thank you. He knew what
was coming.</p>
<p>
Dammit, he'd rather think about the other bad time, the day with the
gun they'd taken from the armoury...</p>
<p>
Na; he didn't want to think at all. He tried to stop thinking about
it all by bashing his head up and down, staring at the mad blue sky
and hitting his head up-down, up-down off the pale scaly rocks
beneath his head where the guano pellets had been swept away, but it
hurt too much and the rocks just gave and he didn't have the strength
seriously to threaten a determined speckfly anyway, so he stopped.</p>
<p>
Where was he?</p>
<p>
Ah yes, the crater, the drowned volcano... we're in a crater; an old
crater in an old volcano, long dead and filled with water. And in the
middle of the crater there was a little island and he was <I>on</I>
the little island, and he was looking <I>off the</I> little island at
the crater walls and he was a <I>man</I> wasn't he children, and he
was a nice man and he was <I>dying on</I> the little island and...</p>
<p>
'Scream?' he said.</p>
<p>
Doubtfully, the sky looked down.</p>
<p>
It was blue.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
It had been Elethiomel's idea to take the gun. The armoury was
unlocked but guarded at the moment; the adults seemed busy and
worried all the time, and there was talk of sending the children
away. The summer had passed and still they hadn't gone to the city.
They were getting bored.</p>
<p>
'We could run away.'</p>
<p>
They were scuffing through the fallen leaves on a path through the
estate. Elethiomel talked quietly. They couldn't even walk out here
now without guards. The men kept thirty paces ahead and twenty
behind. How could you play properly with all these guards around?
Back nearer the house they were allowed out without guards, but that
was even more boring.</p>
<p>
'Don't be silly,' Livueta said.</p>
<p>
'It's not silly,' Darckense said. 'We could go to the city. It would
be something to do.'</p>
<p>
'Yes.' Cheradenine said. 'You're right. It would be.'</p>
<p>
'Why do you want to go to the city?' Livueta said. 'It might be...
dangerous there.'</p>
<p>
'Well it's boring here,' Darckense said.</p>
<p>
'Yeah, it is,' Cheradenine agreed.</p>
<p>
'We could take a boat and sail away,' Cheradenine said.</p>
<p>
'We wouldn't even really have to sail, or row,' Elethiomel said. 'All
we'd have to do is push the boat out and we'd end up in the city
eventually anyway.'</p>
<p>
'I wouldn't go,' Livueta said, kicking at a pile of leaves.</p>
<p>
'Oh, Livvy,' Darckense said. 'Now you're being boring. Come on. We've
got to do things together.'</p>
<p>
'I wouldn't go,' Livueta repeated.</p>
<p>
Elethiomel pressed his lips together. He kicked hard at a huge pile
of leaves, sending them up into the air like an explosion. A couple
of the guards turned round quickly, then relaxed, looked away again.
'We've got to do something,' he said, looking at the guards ahead,
admiring the big automatic rifles they were allowed to use. He'd
never even been allowed to touch a proper big gun; just piddling
little small-bore pistols and light carbines.</p>
<p>
He caught one of the leaves as it fell past his face.</p>
<p>
'Leaves...' he turned the leaf, this way and that, in front of his
eyes. 'Trees are stupid,' he told the others.</p>
<p>
'Of course they are,' Livueta said. 'They don't have nerves and
brains, do they?'</p>
<p>
'I don't mean that,' he said, crumpling the leaf in his hands. 'I
mean they're such a stupid idea. All this waste every autumn. A tree
that kept its leaves wouldn't have to grow new ones; it would grow
bigger than all the rest; it would be the king of the trees.'</p>
<p>
'But the leaves are beautiful!' Darckense said.</p>
<p>
Elethiomel shook his head, exchanging looks with Cheradenine.
'Girls!' he laughed, sneering.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He forgot what the other word was for a crater; there was another
word for a crater, for a big volcanic crater, there was definitely
another word for it, there was absolutely and positively another
word for it, I just put it down for a minute here and now some
bastard's swiped it, the bastard... if I could just find it, I... I
just put it down here a minute ago...</p>
<p>
Where was the volcano?</p>
<p>
The volcano was on a big island on an inland sea, somewhere.</p>
<p>
He looked around at the distant heights of the crater walls, trying
to remember where this somewhere was. As he moved, his shoulder hurt,
where one of the robbers had stabbed him. He'd attempted to protect
the wound by shooing the clouds of flies away, but he was fairly sure
they'd already laid their eggs.</p>
<p>
(Not too near the heart; at least he still carried her there, and it
would take a while for the corruption to spread that far. He'd be
dead by then, before they found their way to his heart and her.)</p>
<p>
But why not? Go ahead; be my guests, little maggots, eat away, sup
your fill; quite probably I'll be dead anyway by the time you hatch,
and will save you the pain and torment of my attempts to scratch you
out... Dear little maggots, <I>sweet</I> little maggots. (Sweet
little me; I'm the one that's being eaten.)</p>
<p>
He paused and thought about the pool, the little puddle that he
orbited around, like a captured rock. It was at the bottom of a small
depression, and it seemed to him that he kept on trying to get out
away from the stinking water and the slime and the flies that crowded
around it and the bird shit he kept crawling through... He didn't
manage it; he always seemed to end up back here for some reason, but
he <I>thought</I> about it a lot.</p>
<p>
The pool was shallow, muddy, rocky and smelly; it was foul and horrid
and bloated past its normal limits with the sickness and the blood
that he had spilled out into it; he wanted to leave, to get well away
from it. Then he would send in a heavy-bomber raid.</p>
<p>
He started to crawl again, hauling himself round the pool, disturbing
pellets and insects, and heading off towards the lake at one point,
then coming back, back to the same point as before, and stopping,
gazing transfixed at the pool and the rock.</p>
<p>
What had he been doing?</p>
<p>
Helping the locals, as usual. Honest counsel; advisor, keeping the
loonies at bay and people sweet; later leading a small army. But
they'd assumed he'd betray them, and that he'd use the army he'd
trained as his own power base. So, on the eve of their victory, the
very hour they'd finally stormed the Sanctum, they'd struck at him,
too.</p>
<p>
They'd taken him to the furnace room, stripped him naked; he'd
escaped, but soldiers had been pounding down the stairs and he'd had
to run. He'd been forced into the river, when they cornered him
again. The dive almost knocked him out. Currents took him and he
spun, lazily... he woke up in the morning, under a winch housing on a
big river barge; he had no idea how he'd got there. There was a rope
trailing astern, and he could only guess he'd climbed up that. His
head still hurt.</p>
<p>
He took some clothes which were drying on a line behind the
wheelhouse, but he was seen; he dived overboard with them, swam to
the shore. He'd still been hounded, and all the time he was forced
further away from the city and Sanctum, where the Culture might look
for him. He spent hours trying to work out how to contact them.</p>
<p>
He'd been on a stolen mount, skirting the edge of a water-filled
volcanic crater when the robbers struck; they'd beaten him and raped
him and cut the tendons in his legs and tossed him into the stinking,
yellow-tinged waters of the crater lake, then thrown boulders at him
as he tried to swim away, using only his arms, legs floating
uselessly behind him.</p>
<p>
He knew one of the rocks would hit him sooner or later, so he tried
to coax up some of that wonderful Culture training, quickly
hyperventilated, and then dived. He only had to wait a couple of
seconds. A big rock splashed into the water, in the line of bubbles
he'd left when he dived; he embraced the rock like a lover as it
wobbled down towards him, and let it take him deep into the darkness
of the lake, switching off the way he'd been taught to, but not
really caring very much if it didn't work, and he never woke up
again.</p>
<p>
He'd thought <I>ten minutes</I> when he dived. He woke up in crushing
darkness; remembered, and dragged his arms out from under the rock.
He kicked for the light but nothing happened. He used his arms. The
surface came down to meet him, eventually. Air had never tasted so
sweet.</p>
<p>
The walls of the crater lake were sheer; the tiny rock island was the
only place to swim to. Screeching birds lifted from the island as he
thrashed his way ashore.</p>
<p>
At least, he thought, as he dragged himself onto the rock through the
guano, it wasn't the priests that found me. Then I'd <I>really</I>
have been in trouble.</p>
<p>
The bends set in a few minutes later, like slow acid seeping into
every joint, and he wished the priests had got him.</p>
<p>
Still - he told himself, talking to keep his mind away from the pain
- they would come for him; the Culture would come down with a
beautiful big ship and they would take him up and make it all better.</p>
<p>
He was sure they would. He'd be looked after and made better and he'd
be safe, very safe and well looked after and free from pain, back in
their paradise, and it would be like... like being a child again;
like being in the garden again. Except - some rogue part of his mind
reminded him - bad things happened in gardens too, sometimes.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Darckense got the armoury guard to help her with a door that was
stuck, along the corridor, just round the corner. Cheradenine slipped
in and took the autorifle Elethiomel had described. He got back out,
covering the gun in a cape, and heard Darckense thanking the guard
profusely. They all met up in the rear hall cloakroom, where they
whispered excitedly in the comforting smell of wet cloth and floor
polish, and took turns holding the gun. It was very heavy.</p>
<p>
'There's only one magazine!'</p>
<p>
'I couldn't see the others.'</p>
<p>
'God you're blind, Zak. Have to do, I suppose.'</p>
<p>
'Ugh; it's oily,' Darckense said.</p>
<p>
'That stops rust,' Cheradenine explained.</p>
<p>
'Where are we supposed to let it off?' Livueta asked.</p>
<p>
'We'll hide it here and then get out after dinner,' Elethiomel said,
taking the weapon from Darckense. 'It's Big-nose for studies and he
always sleeps right through anyway. Mother and father will be
entertaining that colonel; we can get out of the house and into the
woods and fire - not &quot;let off&quot;, actually - fire the gun
there.'</p>
<p>
'We'll probably get killed,' Livueta said. 'The guards will think
we're terrorists.'</p>
<p>
Elethiomel shook his head patiently. 'Livvy, you are stupid.' He
pointed the gun at her. 'It's got a silencer; what do you think this
bit is?'</p>
<p>
'Huh,' Livueta said, pushing the point away from her. 'Has it got a
safety catch?'</p>
<p>
Elethiomel looked uncertain for just a moment. 'Of course,' he said,
loudly, then flinched a little and glanced at the closed door to the
hall. 'Of course,' he whispered. 'Come on; we'll hide it here and
come back for it when we've got away from Big-nose.'</p>
<p>
'You can't hide it here,' Livueta said.</p>
<p>
'Bet I can.'</p>
<p>
'It smells too much,' Livueta said. 'The oil smells; you'd smell it
as soon as you walked in here. What if father decides to go for a
walk?'</p>
<p>
Elethiomel looked worried. Livueta moved past him, opened a small
high window.</p>
<p>
'How about hiding it on the stone boat?' Cheradenine suggested.
'Nobody ever goes there at this time of year.'</p>
<p>
Elethiomel thought about this. He grabbed the cloak Cheradenine had
wrapped the gun in originally and covered the weapon again. 'All
right. You take it.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Still not far enough back, or not far enough forward... he wasn't
sure. The right place; that was what he was looking for. The right
place. Place was all important, place meant everything. Take this
rock...</p>
<p>
'Take you, rock,' he said. He squinted at it.</p>
<p>
Ah yes, here we have the nasty big flat rock, sitting doing nothing,
just amoral and dull, and it sits like an island in the polluted
pool. The pool is a tiny lake on the little island, and the island is
in a drowned crater. The crater is a volcanic crater, the volcano
forms part of an island in a big inland sea. The inland sea is like a
giant lake on a continent and the continent is like an island
sitting in the seas of the planet. The planet is like an island in
the sea of space within its system, and the system floats within the
cluster, which is like an island in the sea of the galaxy, which is
like an island in the archipelago of its local group, which is an
island within the universe; the universe is like an island floating
in a sea of space in the Continua, and they float like islands in the
Reality, and...</p>
<p>
But down through the Continua, the Universe, the Local Group, the
Galaxy, the Cluster, the System, the Planet, the Continent, the
Island, the Lake, the Island... the rock remained. AND THAT MEANT THE
ROCK, THE CRAPPY AWFUL ROCK HERE WAS THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE, THE
CONTINUA, <I>THE WHOLE REALITY</I>!</p>
<p>
The word was caldera. The lake was in a drowned caldera. He raised
his head, looked out over the still, yellowish water towards the
crater cliffs, and seemed to see a boat made of stone.</p>
<p>
'Scream,' he said.</p>
<p>
'Piss off,' he heard the sky say, unconvinced.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The sky was full of cloud and it was getting dark early; their
language tutor took longer than usual to fall asleep behind his high
desk, and they almost decided to abandon the whole plan until
tomorrow, but couldn't bear to. They crept out of the classroom, then
walked as normally as they could, down to the rear hall, where they
picked up their boots and jackets.</p>
<p>
'See,' Livueta whispered. 'It smells a bit of gun-oil anyway.'</p>
<p>
'I can't smell any,' Elethiomel lied.</p>
<p>
The banqueting rooms - where a visiting Colonel and his staff were
being wined and dined that evening - faced the parks to the front of
the house; the lake with the stone boat was at the rear.</p>
<p>
'Just going to walk round the lake, Sergeant,' Cheradenine told the
guard who stopped them on the gravel path towards the stone boat. The
sergeant nodded, told them to walk quickly; it would soon be dark.</p>
<p>
They sneaked onto the boat, found the rifle where Cheradenine had
hidden it, under a stone bench on the upper deck.</p>
<p>
As he lifted it from the flagstone deck, Elethiomel knocked the gun
against the side of the bench.</p>
<p>
There was a snapping noise, and the magazine fell off; then there was
a noise like a spring, and bullets clicked and clattered over the
stones.</p>
<p>
'Idiot!' Cheradenine said.</p>
<p>
'Shut up!'</p>
<p>
'Oh no,' Livueta said, bending down and scooping up some of the
rounds.</p>
<p>
'Let's go back,' Darckense whispered. 'I'm frightened.'</p>
<p>
'Don't worry,' Cheradenine said, patting her hand. 'Come on; look for
the bullets.'</p>
<p>
It seemed to take ages to find them and clean them and press them
back into the magazine. Even then, they thought there were probably a
few missing. By the time they'd finished and got the magazine slotted
back into place, it was almost night.</p>
<p>
'It's far too dark,' Livueta said. They were all crouched down at the
balustrade, looking out over the lake to the house. Elethiomel held
the gun.</p>
<p>
'No!' he said. 'We can still see.'</p>
<p>
'No we can't, not properly,' Cheradenine told him.</p>
<p>
'Let's leave it till tomorrow,' Livueta said.</p>
<p>
'They'll notice we're gone soon,' Cheradenine whispered. 'We haven't
got the time!'</p>
<p>
'No!' Elethiomel said, looking out to where the guard walked slowly
past the end of the causeway. Livueta looked too; it was the sergeant
who'd talked to them.</p>
<p>
'You're being an idiot!' Cheradenine said, and put one hand out,
taking hold of the gun. Elethiomel pulled away.</p>
<p>
'It's mine; leave it!'</p>
<p>
'It is <I>not</I> yours!' Cheradenine hissed. 'It's ours; it belongs
to our family, not yours!' He got both hands on the gun. Elethiomel
pulled back again.</p>
<p>
'Stop it!' Darckense said, her voice tiny.</p>
<p>
'Don't be so...' Livueta started to say.</p>
<p>
She looked over the edge of the parapet, to where she thought she'd
heard a noise.</p>
<p>
'Give it <I>here</I>!'</p>
<p>
'Let it go!'</p>
<p>
'Please stop; please stop. Let's go back in, please...'</p>
<p>
Livueta didn't hear them. She was staring, wide-eyed, dry-mouthed,
over the stone parapet. A black-covered man picked up the rifle the
guard sergeant had dropped. The guard sear-geant himself lay on the
gravel. Something glittered in the black-dressed man's hand,
reflecting the lights of the house. The man pushed the slack form of
the sergeant off the gravel, into the lake.</p>
<p>
Her breath caught in her throat. Livueta ducked down. She flapped her
hands at the two boys. 'St...' she said. They still struggled.</p>
<p>
'St...'</p>
<p>
'Mine!'</p>
<p>
'Let <I>go</I>!'</p>
<p>
'Stop!' she hissed, and struck them both on the head. They both
stared at her. 'Somebody just killed that sergeant; just out there.'</p>
<p>
'What?' Both boys looked over the parapet. Elethiomel still held the
gun.</p>
<p>
Darckense squatted down and started to cry.</p>
<p>
'Where?'</p>
<p>
'There; that's his body! There in the water!'</p>
<p>
'Sure,' Elethiomel said in a whispered drawl. 'And who...'</p>
<p>
The three of them saw one shadowy figure move towards the house,
keeping in the shade of the bushes bordering the path. A dozen or so
men - just patches of darkness on the gravel - moved along the side
of the lake, where there was a narrow strip of grass.</p>
<p>
'Terrorists!' Elethiomel said excitedly, as the three all ducked back
behind the balustrade, where Darckense wept quietly.</p>
<p>
'Tell the house,' Livueta said. 'Fire the gun.'</p>
<p>
'Take the silencer off first,' Cheradenine said.</p>
<p>
Elethiomel struggled with the end of the barrel. 'It's stuck!'</p>
<p>
'Let me try!' All three tried.</p>
<p>
'Fire it anyway,' Cheradenine said.</p>
<p>
'Yeah!' Elethiomel whispered. He shook the gun, hefted it. 'Yeah!' he
said. He knelt, put the gun on the stone bulwark, sighted.</p>
<p>
'Be careful,' Livueta said.</p>
<p>
Elethiomel aimed at the dark men, crossing the path towards the
house. He pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>
The gun seemed to explode. The whole deck of the stone boat lit up.
The noise was tremendous; Elethiomel was thrown back, gun still
firing, blasting tracer into the night sky. He crashed into the
bench. Darckense shrieked at the top of her lungs. She leapt up;
firing sounded from near the house.</p>
<p>
'Darkle; get down!' Livueta screamed. Lines of light flickered and
cracked above the stone boat.</p>
<p>
Darckense stood screaming, then started to run for the stairs.
Elethiomel shook his head, looked up as the girl ran past him.
Livueta grabbed at her and missed. Cheradenine tried to tackle her.</p>
<p>
The lines of light lowered, detonating chips of rock off the stones
all around them in tiny clouds of dust, at the same time as
Darckense, still screaming, stumbled to the stairs.</p>
<p>
The bullet entered Darckense through the hip: the other three heard -
quite distinctly - the noise that it made, above the gunfire and the
girl's scream.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He was hit too, though he didn't know by what at the time.</p>
<p>
The attack on the house was beaten off. Darckense lived. She almost
died, from loss of blood, and shock; but she lived. The best surgeons
in the land fought to rebuild her pelvis, shattered into a dozen
major pieces and a hundred splinters by the impact of the round.</p>
<p>
Bits of bone had travelled her body; they found fragments in her
legs, in one arm, in her internal organs, even a piece in her chin.
The army surgeons were fairly used to dealing with that sort of
injury, and they had the time (because the war hadn't yet started
then) and the incentive (for her father was a very important man) to
put her back together as best they could. Still, she would walk
awkwardly until she stopped growing, at least.</p>
<p>
One of the bone shards travelled further than her own body; it
entered his. Just above the heart.</p>
<p>
The army surgeons said it would be too dangerous to operate. In time,
they said, his body would reject the fragment of bone.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
But it never did.</p>
<p>
He started to crawl round the pool again.</p>
<p>
Caldera! That was the word, the name.</p>
<p>
(Such signals were important, and he'd found the one he'd been
looking for.)</p>
<p>
Victory, he said to himself, as he hauled himself round, scattering
a last few of the bird-droppings out of his way, and apologising to
the insects. Everything was going to be just fine, he decided. He
knew that, now, and knew that in the end you always won, and that
even when you lost, you never knew, and there was only one fight, and
he was at the centre of the whole ridiculous thing any way, and
Caldera was the word, and Zakalwe was the word, and Staberinde was
the word, and -</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
They came for him; they came down with a big beautiful ship, and they
took him up and away and they made him all better again...</p>
<p>
'They never learn,' the sky sighed, quite distinctly.</p>
<p>
'Fuck you,' he said.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
It was years later that Cheradenine - returned from the military
academy and looking for Darckense, and sent in that direction by a
monosyllabic gardener - walked up the soft carpet of leaves to the
door of the little summerhouse.</p>
<p>
He heard a scream from inside. Darckense.</p>
<p>
He dashed up the steps, drawing his pistol, and kicked the door open.</p>
<p>
Darckense's startled face twisted over her shoulder, regarding him.
Her hands were still clasped round Elethiomel's neck. Elethiomel sat,
trousers round his ankles, hands on Darckense's naked hips under her
bunched-up dress, and looked calmly at him.</p>
<p>
Elethiomel was sitting on the little chair that Livueta had made in
her carpentry class, long ago.</p>
<p>
'Hi there, old chap,' he said to the young man holding the pistol.</p>
<p>
Cheradenine looked into Elethiomel's eyes for a moment, then turned
away, holstering the pistol and buttoning the holster and walking
out, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>
Behind him he heard Darckense crying, and Elethiomel laughing.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The island in the centre of the caldera became quiet again. Some
birds flew back to it.</p>
<p>
The island had changed, thanks to the man. Scraped in a circle all
round the central depression of the islet, drawn in a pathway of
black bird droppings cleared away from the pale rock, and with the
appropriate tail of just the right length leading off to one side
(its other end pointing at the rock, which was the central dot), the
island seemed to have a letter or simple pictogram printed on it,
white on black.</p>
<p>
It was the local signal for 'Help me!', and you would only have seen
it from an aircraft, or from space.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
A few years after the scene in the summerhouse, one night while the
forests burned and the distant artillery thundered, a young army
major jumped up onto one of the tanks under his command, and ordered
the driver to take the machine through the woods, following a path
which wound between the old trees.</p>
<p>
They left behind the shell of the recaptured mansion and the glowing
red fires which lit its once grand interior (the fires reflected on
the waters of an ornamental lake, by the wreckage of a demolished
boat made of stone).</p>
<p>
The tank ripped through the woods, demolishing small trees and little
bridges over streams.</p>
<p>
He saw the clearing with the summerhouse through the trees; it was
lit by a flickering white light, as though by God.</p>
<p>
They got to the clearing; a star-shell had fallen into the trees
above, its parachute entangled in the branches. It sizzled and
sputtered and shed a pure, sharp, extreme light all over the
clearing.</p>
<p>
Inside the summerhouse, the little wooden chair was quite visible.
The tank's gun was pointing straight at the small building.</p>
<p>
'Sir?' the tank commander said, peering worriedly from the hatch
beneath.</p>
<p>
Major Zakalwe looked down at him.</p>
<p>
'Fire,' he said.</p>

<p>
The first snow of the year settled over the upper slopes of the cleft
city; it floated out of the grey-brown sky and fitted itself over the
streets and the buildings like a sheet thrown over a corpse.</p>
<p>
He dined alone at a large table. The screen he had wheeled into the
middle of the brightly lit room flickered with the images of released
prisoners from some other planet. The balcony doors were lying open,
and through them drifted small examples of the falling snow. The rich
carpet of the room was frosted white where the snow had settled, and
stained dark further in where the heat of the room had melted the
crystals back into water again. Outside, the city was a mass of
half-unseen grey shapes. Ordered lights ran in lines and curls,
dimmed by distance and passing flurries.</p>
<p>
Darkness came like a black flag waved over the canyon, drawing back
the greyness from the shores of the city, then pushing forward the
individual specks of street and building lights as though in
recompense.</p>
<p>
The silent screen and silent snow conspired; light flung a path into
the silent chaos of the fall beyond the window. He got up and closed
the doors, the shutters and the curtains.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The next day was bright and clear, and the city could be seen sharply
as far as the canyon's broad curve would allow; buildings and lines
of roads and aqueducts stood out as though freshly drawn, gleaming
like new paint, while cold, keen sunlight rubbed a shine into the
dullest grey stone. The snow lay over the top half of the city;
below, where the temperature stayed more level, the snow had fallen
as rain. There too the precise new day was displayed; he looked down
from the car and studied the sight. Every detail delighted him; he
counted arches and cars and traced the lines of water and road and
flue and track through all their convolutions and hidings; he
inspected every flash of reflected sunlight, squinted at every dot of
wheeling bird and noted every broken window, through the very dark
glasses.</p>
<p>
The car was the longest and sleekest of all those he'd bought or
hired; it was an eight seater with a huge inefficient rotary engine
driving both rear axles, and he had its collapsible slatted hood
down. He sat in the back and enjoyed the feel of the cold air on his
face.</p>
<p>
The terminal earring beeped. 'Zakalwe?'</p>
<p>
'Yes, Diziet?' he said. Talking quietly, he didn't think the driver
would hear him over the wind-roar. He raised the screen between them
anyway.</p>
<p>
'Hello. Good. Very slight time delay from here, but not much. How's
it going?'</p>
<p>
'Nothing yet. I'm called Staberinde and I'm causing a fuss. I own
Staberinde Airlines, there's a Staberinde Street, a Staberinde
Store, a Staberinde Railway, Staberinde Local Broadcasts... there's
even a cruise liner called the Staberinde. I've spent money like
hydrogen, established within a week a business empire most people
would take a lifetime to set up, and I'm instantly one of the most
talked-about people on the planet, maybe in the Cluster...'</p>
<p>
'Yes. But, Cher...'</p>
<p>
'Had to take a service tunnel and leave the hotel by an annexe this
morning; the courtyard's crammed with press.' He glanced over his
shoulder. 'I'm amazed we really seem to have shaken the hounds off.'</p>
<p>
'Yes, Che...'</p>
<p>
'Dammit, I'm probably putting the war off all by myself just by being
this crazy; people would rather see what I'm going to squander my
money on next than fight.'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe; Zakalwe,' Sma said. 'Fine; great. But what is all this
supposed to <I>do</I>?'</p>
<p>
He sighed, looked out at the derelict buildings speeding by to one
side, not far under the rimrock. 'It's supposed to get the name
Staberinde into the media, so that even a recluse studying ancient
documents will get to hear the name.'</p>
<p>
'... And?'</p>
<p>
'... And there was something we did in the war, Beychae and I; a
particular stratagem. We called it the Staberinde strategy. But only
between ourselves. <I>Strictly</I> between ourselves; it only meant
anything to Beychae because I explained about its... origin. If he
hears that word he <I>must</I> wonder what's going on.'</p>
<p>
'Sounds like a great theory, Cheradenine, but it hasn't actually
<I>worked</I>, has it?'</p>
<p>
'No.' He sighed, then frowned. 'There is media input to this place
he's in, isn't there? You're sure he's not just a prisoner?'</p>
<p>
'There is network access, but not directly. They've got it well
screened; even we can't see exactly what's going on. And we are
certain he's not a prisoner.'</p>
<p>
He thought for a moment. 'How's the pre-war situation?'</p>
<p>
'Well, the full-scale still looks inevitable, but the likely lead
time's increased by a couple of days, to eight-to-ten, after a viable
trigger-event. So... so far, so good, to be optimistic.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm.' He rubbed his chin, watching the frozen waters of an aqueduct
slide past, fifty metres beneath the turnpike. 'Well,' he said. 'I'm
on my way now to the university; breakfast with the Dean. I'm setting
up the Staberinde Scholarship and the Staberinde Fellowship and the
Staberinde... Chair,' he grimaced. 'And maybe even the Staberinde
College. Perhaps I should mention these stupendously important wax
tablets to the man as well.'</p>
<p>
'Yes, good idea,' Sma said, after a short pause.</p>
<p>
'Okay. I don't suppose they have any bearing on what Beychae's got
his nose buried in, have they?'</p>
<p>
'No,' Sma said. 'But they'd certainly be stored in the same place
he's working; I guess you could reasonably ask to inspect their
security arrangements down there, or just want to see where they'd be
kept.'</p>
<p>
'All right. I'll mention the tablets.'</p>
<p>
'Check the guy hasn't got a weak heart, first.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah, Diziet.'</p>
<p>
'One other thing. That couple you asked us about; the ones that came
to your street party.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah.'</p>
<p>
'They're Governance; that's the term they use for major local
stockholders who tell the corporate chiefs...'</p>
<p>
'Yes, Diziet, I remember the term.'</p>
<p>
'Well, these two are Solotol's, and what they say goes; the Chief
Execs will almost certainly do exactly as they suggest as far as
Beychae is concerned, and that means the official government will,
too. They are also, of course, effectively above the law. Don't mess
with them, Charadenine.'</p>
<p>
'Me?' he said innocently, smiling to the cold, dry wind.</p>
<p>
'Yes, you. That's all from this end. Have a nice breakfast.'</p>
<p>
'Bye,' he said. The city slid past; the car's tyres made hissing,
tearing noises on the dark-surfaced turnpike. He turned up the
heating in the footwell.</p>
<p>
This was a quiet part of the under-cliff road. The driver slowed for
a sign and some flashing lights ahead, then almost skidded at the
sudden diversion sign and emergency road markings that turned them
off the road, over a ramp and down onto a long concrete channel with
sheer walls.</p>
<p>
They came to a steep rise with only sky visible beyond; the red lines
indicating the diversion led over the summit. The driver slowed, then
shrugged and gunned the engine. The hump of concrete raised the nose
of the big car, hiding what was on the far side.</p>
<p>
When the driver saw what was over the concrete summit, he shouted in
fear and tried to turn and brake. The big car tipped forward, onto
the ice, and started to slide.</p>
<p>
He had been jolted by the turn and then annoyed that the view had
been taken away. He looked round at the driver and wondered what was
going on.</p>
<p>
Somebody had diverted them off the turnpike and onto a storm drain.
The turnpike was heated and didn't ice up; the storm drain was a
sheet of ice. They had entered near the top, through one small sluice
out of several dozen spread in a semicircle; the broad drain led
down into the depths of the city, crossed by bridges, for over a
kilometre.</p>
<p>
The car had partially turned as the driver came over the top of the
sluice baffle; the vehicle was sliding down sideways, its wheels
spinning and engine roaring, lumbering on and on down the steepening
expanse of the drain and rapidly picking up speed.</p>
<p>
The driver tried to brake again, then attempted to go into reverse,
and finally tried to steer towards the slab-high sides of the drain,
but the car was slithering down faster all the time, and the ice
provided no purchase. The car's wheels shook and the whole body
shuddered as it hit ridges in the ice. The air whistled and the
side-on tyres whined.</p>
<p>
He was staring at the sides of the drain, whirling by at a ridiculous
speed. The vehicle was still slowly turning as it skidded; the driver
screamed as they headed for a massive bridge support; the rear of the
car banged and the whole vehicle leapt as it battered into the
concrete. Bits of metal flew into the air and crashed into the ice
behind, then started skidding down after them. The car was spinning
faster now, in the other direction.</p>
<p>
Bridges, tributary drains, viaducts, overhanging buildings, aqueducts
and huge pipes spanning the drain; all flashed by the revolving car,
hurtling past in the bright light, some shocked white faces gasping
from parapets or open windows.</p>
<p>
He looked forward and saw the driver opening his door.</p>
<p>
'Hey!' he shouted, reaching forward to grab the man.</p>
<p>
The car thundered over the uneven ice. The driver jumped.</p>
<p>
He flung himself into the front, just missing the driver's ankles. He
landed down at the pedals, grasped at the levers and controls and
tugged himself into the driver's seat. The vehicle was turning
faster, jolting and screaming as it hit ridges and raised metal
grilles set in the slope; he glimpsed one wheel and various bits of
bodywork bouncing away behind him. Another teeth-chattering contact
with a bridge support ripped an entire axle free; it flew into the
air and exploded against an iron leg supporting a building,
dislodging bricks and glass and scattering metal like shrapnel.</p>
<p>
He grabbed the steering wheel; it flopped about uselessly. He had the
idea of keeping the car pointing forward if he could, until the
gradually increasing temperature further down the canyon provided a
wet rather than icy slope, but if there was no steering he might as
well jump off too.</p>
<p>
The wheel thumped and burned his hands as it turned; the tyres
squealed wildly; he was thrown forward and his nose hit the wheel.
That felt like a dry patch, he thought. He looked ahead, down the
slope, where the ice was becoming patchy, hugging the shadows of
buildings where the shade fell across the spillway.</p>
<p>
The car was almost straight. He grabbed at the wheel again and
tramped the brake. It didn't seem to do anything. He pedalled reverse
instead. Now the gearbox screamed too; his face wrinkled at the
appalling noise, his feet juddered on the quivering pedal. The wheel
came alive again, for longer, and he was thrown forward once more;
this time he kept a hold of the wheel, and ignored the blood
streaming from his nose.</p>
<p>
Everything was roaring now. The wind and the tyres and the body of
the car; his ears popped and throbbed with the rapidly increasing air
pressure. He looked ahead and saw the concrete was green with weeds.</p>
<p>
'Shit!' he yelled to himself. There was another lip ahead; he wasn't
near the bottom yet; there was another length of slope to come.</p>
<p>
He recalled the driver mentioning tools inside the front passenger
bench; he hauled the seat up and grabbed the biggest piece of metal
he could see, then kicked the door open and jumped.</p>
<p>
He slammed into the concrete, almost losing his grip on the metal
tool. The car started to slew in front of him, leaving a last patch
of ice and hitting the section of the slope covered by weed; curved
fountains of spray leapt from its remaining wheels. He rolled over,
onto his back, spray hissing up into his face as he slithered down
the steep, weeded slope; he held the metal tool in both hands,
clamped it between his chest and upper arm; forced it down into the
concrete under the water and weeds.</p>
<p>
The metal thrummed in his hands.</p>
<p>
The spillway lip swept up towards him. He pressed harder; the tool
bit into the rough concrete, shaking his whole body, jarring his
teeth and his vision; a tight wad of ripped-up weed grew under his
arm like some mutant hair.</p>
<p>
The car hit the lip first; it somersaulted into the air and started
tumbling, disappearing. He hit the lip and almost lost his hold on
the tool again. He rose and slowed, but not enough. Then he was over.
The dark glasses sailed off his face; he resisted the urge to grab at
them.</p>
<p>
The spillway continued for another half kilometre; the car smashed
upside-down into the concrete slope, scattering debris which
continued skidding down towards the river at the bottom of the
canyon's great V; the gearbox and remaining axle parted company with
the chassis and bounced into some pipes straddling the drain,
fracturing them. Water poured out.</p>
<p>
He went back to treating the metal tool as though it was an ice-axe,
and slowly reduced his speed.</p>
<p>
He passed under the fractured pipes, which were gushing warm water.</p>
<p>
What, not sewage? he thought brightly. Today was looking up.</p>
<p>
He looked, perplexed, at the metal tool still vibrating in his grip,
and wondered exactly what it was; probably something to do with the
tyres or starting the engine, he decided, looking around.</p>
<p>
He negotiated one final spillway lip and slid gently into the
shallows of the broad river Lotol itself. Bits of the car had already
arrived.</p>
<p>
He stood up and squelched ashore. He checked there was nothing else
coming down the spillway that might strike him, and sat. He was
shaking; he dabbed at his bloody nose. He felt bruised from the
battering in the car. There were some people staring at him over the
top of a nearby promenade. He waved at them.</p>
<p>
He stood up, wondering how you got out of this concrete canyon. He
looked up the spillway, but could see only a short way; a final lip
of concrete blocked the rest of the view.</p>
<p>
He wondered what had happened to the driver.</p>
<p>
The concrete lip he was looking at formed a dark bump against the
skyline. The bump hung for a few seconds, then came down on the thin
coating of water that floated down the slope, staining it red. What
was left of the driver skidded past him and bumped into the river,
edging past the chassis of the shattered car and setting off
downstream, swirling pinkly in the water, revolving.</p>
<p>
He shook his head. He brought his hand up to his nose, waggled the
tip experimentally, and gasped with pain. This made the fifteenth
time he'd broken his nose.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He grimaced into the mirror, snorting back a mixture of blood and
warm water. The black porcelain basin swirled with gently steaming
suds, pink-flecked. He touched his nose with great delicacy and
frowned into the mirror.</p>
<p>
'I miss breakfast, lose a perfectly proficient driver and my best
car, I break my nose yet again <I>and</I> get an old raincoat of
immense sentimental value dirtier than it's ever been in its life
before, and all you can say is &quot;That's funny&quot;?'</p>
<p>
'Sorry, Cheradenine. I just mean, that's weird. I don't know why
they'd do something like that. You are certain it was deliberate?
Oof.'</p>
<p>
'What was that?'</p>
<p>
'Nothing. You are certain it wasn't just an accident?'</p>
<p>
'Positive. I called for a spare car, and the police, then went back
to where it happened. No diversion; all gone. But there were traces
of industrial solvent where they'd removed the false red road
markings from the top of the storm drain.'</p>
<p>
'Ah. Ah; yeah...' Sma's voice sounded odd.</p>
<p>
He took the transceiver bead off his ear lobe and looked hard at it.
'Sma...'</p>
<p>
'Whoo. Yeah, well, as I said; if it was those two Governance bods,
the police won't do anything. But I can't understand them behaving
like that.'</p>
<p>
He let the wash-bowl drain and dabbed tenderly at his nose with a
fluffy hotel towel. He put the terminal earring back on his ear.
'Maybe they just object to the fact I'm using Vanguard money. Maybe
they think I'm Mr Vanguard or something.' He waited for a reply.
'Sma? I said maybe they...'</p>
<p>
'Ow. Yes. Sorry. Yes; I heard you. You might be right.'</p>
<p>
'Anyway, there's more.'</p>
<p>
'God. What?'</p>
<p>
He picked up an ornately decorated plastic screen-card, which -
against a background of what looked like a fairly wild party - slowly
flashed a message on and off. 'An invitation. To me. I'll read it
out: &quot;Mr Staberinde; congratulations on your narrow escape. Do
please come to a fancy-dress party this evening; a car will pick you
up at rim-set. Costume provided.&quot; No address.' He put the card
back behind the wash-bowl taps. 'According to the concierge that
arrived at about the same time I called the police after my car went
tobogganing.'</p>
<p>
'Fancy dress party, eh?' Sma giggled. 'Better watch your ass,
Zakalwe.' There was more giggling, not all of it Sma's.</p>
<p>
'Sma,' he said frostily. 'If I've called at an awkward time...'</p>
<p>
Sma cleared her throat, sounded suddenly business-like. 'Not at all.
Sounds like it was the same lot. You going?'</p>
<p>
'I think so, but not in their costume, whatever that turns out to
be.'</p>
<p>
'All right. We'll track you. Are you absolutely positive you don't
want a knife missile or...'</p>
<p>
'I don't want to get into that argument again, Diziet,' he said,
dabbing his face dry and sniffing hard again, inspecting himself in
the mirror. 'What I was thinking about was this; if these people did
react like this just because of Vanguard, maybe we can persuade them
there's an opportunity for them here.'</p>
<p>
'What sort of opportunity?'</p>
<p>
He went through to the bedroom, collapsed on the bed, staring up at
the painted ceiling. 'Beychae was connected with Vanguard at first,
yes?'</p>
<p>
'Honorary President-Director. Gave it credibility while we were
starting up. He was only involved for a year or two.'</p>
<p>
'But there is that link.' He swung his legs off the bed and sat up,
staring out of the window at the snow-bright city. 'And one of the
theories we believe these guys have is that Vanguard is run by some
sort of namby-pamby machine that's developed consciousness and
conscience...'</p>
<p>
'Or just by some old recluse with philanthropic intentions,' Sma
agreed.</p>
<p>
'So; say this mythical machine or person had existed, but then
somebody else got hold of the reins; disabled the machine, killed the
philanthropist. And then started spending their ill-gotten gains.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm,' Sma said. 'Mmm. Mmm.' She coughed again. 'Yes... ah. Well,
they'd be acting a lot like you've been, I suppose.'</p>
<p>
'So do I,' he said, going to the window; he picked up a pair of dark
glasses from a small table, put them on.</p>
<p>
Something beeped near the bed. 'Hold on.' He turned, crossed to the
bedside and picked up the same small device he'd scanned the two top
floors with when he'd first arrived. He looked at the display,
smiled, and left the room. Walking down the corridor, still holding
the machine, he said, 'Sorry; somebody bouncing a laser off the
window in the room I was in, trying to eavesdrop.'</p>
<p>
He entered a suite facing uphill and sat on the bed. 'Anyway; could
you make it look like there'd been some sort of... event in the
Vanguard Foundation, a few days before I arrived here? Some sort of
cataclysmic change but the signs are only appearing now? I don't know
what, especially as it all has to be back-dated, but something that
the markets, say, only just get hold of now; something buried in the
trading figures... would that be possible?'</p>
<p>
'I...' Sma said, hesitantly. 'I don't know. Ship?'</p>
<p>
'Hello?' the <I>Xenophobe</I> said.</p>
<p>
'Can we do what Zakalwe just asked?'</p>
<p>
'I'll listen to what it was,' the ship said. Then, 'Yes; best get one
of the GCUs to handle it, but it can be done.'</p>
<p>
'Great,' he said, lying back on the bed. 'Also, as of now - and
again, back-dating where we can interfere with computer records -
Vanguard becomes an unethical corporation. Sell the R&amp;D
department investigating ultra-strong materials for space habitats
and that sort of stuff; have it pick up stock in companies promoting
terraforming. Close a few factories; start a few lock-outs; halt all
charitable works; skim the pension fund.'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe! We're supposed to be the good guys!'</p>
<p>
'I know, but if I can get our Governance pals to think I've taken
over Vanguard, and I think the way they do...' He paused. 'Sma; do I
have to spell it out?'</p>
<p>
'Ah... ouch. What? Oh... no; you think they might try and get you to
convince Beychae that Vanguard's still doing what <I>we</I> want it
to do, and so get him to declare for it?'</p>
<p>
'Exactly.' He clasped his hands under his neck, adjusting his
pony-tail. This bed had mirrors on the ceiling above, not a painting.
He studied the distant reflection of his nose.</p>
<p>
'Long... um, shot, Zakalwe,' Sma said.</p>
<p>
'I think we have to try it.'</p>
<p>
'It means wrecking a commercial reputation it's taken decades to
establish.'</p>
<p>
'That more important than stopping the war, Diziet?'</p>
<p>
'Of course not, but... ah... of course not, but we can't be certain
it'll work.'</p>
<p>
'Well, I say we do it now. It has a better chance than offering the
university those goddamn tablets.'</p>
<p>
'You've never liked that plan, have you, Zakalwe?' Sma sounded
annoyed.</p>
<p>
'This one's better, Sma. I can feel it. Get it done now, so they've
heard about it by the time I get to the party tonight.'</p>
<p>
'Okay, but that thing with the tablets...'</p>
<p>
'Sma; I've re-arranged the meeting with the Dean for the day after
tomorrow, okay? I can mention the goddamn tablets then. But make sure
all this Vanguard stuff goes through now, all right?'</p>
<p>
'I... oh... ah... yeah, right. I suppose so... so... oh, wow. Look,
Zakalwe, something's just come up; was there anything else?'</p>
<p>
'No,' he said loudly.</p>
<p>
'Aww... <I>great</I>. Umm... right, Zakalwe; bye.'</p>
<p>
The transceiver beeped. He tore it off his ear and threw it across
the room.</p>
<p>
'Rampant bitch,' he breathed. He looked at the ceiling.</p>
<p>
He lifted the bedside telephone. 'Yeah; can I speak to... Treyvo? Yes
please.' He waited, dug between two molars with a fingernail. 'Yeah;
night-clerk Treyvo? My very good friend... listen; I'd like a little
company, you know? Indeed... well, there's a largish tip if... that's
right... and, Treyvo; if she comes with a Press pass secreted
anywhere, you're a dead man.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The suit was vulnerable to a shortish list of comparatively heavy
battlefield weaponry, and not much else. He watched the capsule
vibrate its way back under the surface of the desert as the suit
clasped itself around him. He got back into the car and drove back
down to the hotel, just in time to meet the limousine sent by his
hosts for that evening.</p>
<p>
The cluster's media had been cleared from the hotel courtyard that
afternoon, on his instructions, so there was no undignified dive
through their lights and mikes and questions. He stood, dark glasses
in place, on the steps of the hotel as the great dark car -
significantly more impressive than the one he'd almost been killed in
that morning, he was somewhat disappointed to note - drew smoothly to
a halt. A huge man, grey haired, with a pale, heavily scarred face,
unfolded himself from the driver's compartment and held open a rear
door, bowing slowly.</p>
<p>
'Thank you,' he said to the big man as he stepped into the vehicle.
The fellow bowed again, and closed the door. He sat back in plushly
luxurious upholstery that couldn't make up its mind whether it was a
seat or a bed. The car's windows dimmed in response to the lights of
the media people as the vehicle exited from the hotel courtyard. He
gave what he hoped was a regal wave, all the same.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The evening city lights streamed past; the car thundered quietly. He
inspected a package on the seat/bed beside him; it was paper-wrapped,
and tied up with colourful ribbons. &quot;MR STABERINDE&quot; said a
hand-written note. He brought the suit helmet over, pulled carefully
on a ribbon, opening the package. There were clothes inside. He
lifted them out and looked at them.</p>
<p>
He found a switch on an arm that let him talk to the grey-haired
driver. 'I take it this is my fancy-dress costume. What is it
exactly?'</p>
<p>
The driver looked down, took something from a jacket pocket, and
manipulated it. 'Hello,' said an artificial voice. 'My name is
Mollen. I cannot talk, so I use this machine instead.' He glanced up
at the road, then down again at whatever machine he was using. 'What
do you want to ask me?'</p>
<p>
He didn't like the way the big guy took his eyes off the road each
time he wanted to say something, so he just said, 'never mind.' He
sat back and watched the lights go past, taking the suit helmet off
again.</p>
<p>
They drew into the courtyard of a large, dark house down near a river
in a side-canyon. 'Please follow me, Mr Staberinde,' Mollen said
through his machine.</p>
<p>
'Certainly.' He lifted the suit helmet and followed the taller man up
the steps and into a large foyer. He was carrying the costume he'd
found in the car. Animal heads glared from the walls of the tall
entrance hall. Mollen closed the doors and led him to an elevator
which hummed and rattled its way down for a couple of floors; he
heard the noise and could detect the drug-smoke odour of the party
even before the doors were opened.</p>
<p>
He handed the bundle of clothes to Mollen, keeping only a thin cloak.
'Thanks; I won't be needing the rest.'</p>
<p>
They went out into the party, which was noisy and crowded and full of
bizarre costumes. The men and women all looked sleek and well-fed; he
breathed in the drug smoke that wreathed the motley figures about
him; Mollen led the way through the crowd. People fell silent as they
passed, and a babble of conversation started up in his wake. He heard
the word 'Staberinde' several times.</p>
<p>
They went through doors guarded by men even bigger than Mollen, down
a flight of softly carpeted stairs, and into a large room walled with
glass on one side. Boats bobbed on black water in an underground dock
on the far side of the glass, which reflected a smaller but more
bizarre party. He peeked under the dark glasses, but the view was no
brighter.</p>
<p>
As on the floor above, people walked around with either drug bowls
or, for the especially daring, drink glasses. Everybody was either
badly injured or actually mutilated.</p>
<p>
Men and women turned to look at the new arrival as he followed Mollen
in. Some men and women had arms broken and twisted, the bones tearing
through the skin, showing whitely under the plain light; some had
huge gashes cut into their bodies, some had whole areas of their
flesh flayed and seared, some had had breasts or arms amputated, or
eyes put out, often with the removed article or articles dangling
from other parts of their bodies. The woman from the street party
came towards him, a hand-wide flap of her belly hanging down over her
glistening skirt, her belly muscles rippling inside like dull red
glistening chords.</p>
<p>
'Mr Staberinde; you've come as a space man,' she said. There was an
over-elaborate modulation to her voice he found instantly annoying.</p>
<p>
'Well, I've sort of compromised,' he said, swirling the cape and
fastening it across his shoulders.</p>
<p>
The woman held out her hand. 'Well; welcome, anyway.'</p>
<p>
'Thank you,' he said, taking her hand and kissing it. He half
expected the suit sensory fields to pick up a whiff of some deadly
poison on the woman's delicate hand, and signal danger, but the alarm
remained quiet. He grinned as she took her hand away.</p>
<p>
'What do you find funny, Mr Staberinde?'</p>
<p>
'This!' he laughed, nodding at the people around them.</p>
<p>
'Good,' she said, laughing a little (her belly quivered). 'We did
hope our party might amuse you. Allow me to introduce our good friend
who is making all this possible.'</p>
<p>
She took his arm and guided him through the grisly multitude to a
man sitting on a stool next to a tall, dull grey machine. He was
small and smiling and kept wiping his nose with a large kerchief
which he stuffed raggedly into his otherwise immaculate suit.</p>
<p>
'Doctor, this is the man we told you of, Mr Staberinde.'</p>
<p>
'Sincere greetings and things,' said the little doctor, his face
collapsing into a moist and toothy smile. 'Welcome to our Injured
Party.' He waved round the room at the wounded people, and waved his
hands enthusiastically. 'Would you like an injury? The process is
quite painless, and causes no inconvenience; repairs are speedy and
there aren't any scars. What can I tempt you with? Lacerations?
Compound fracture? Castration? How about a multiple trepanning? You'd
be the only one here.'</p>
<p>
He folded his arms and laughed. 'You're too kind. Thank you, but no.'</p>
<p>
'Oh don't, please,' the little man said, looking wounded. 'Don't
spoil the party; everybody else is taking part; do you really want to
feel so left out? There is no risk of pain or permanent damage of
any sort. I have carried out this sort of operation all over the
civilised universe, and have never had any complaints except from
people who get too attached to their injuries and resist repair. My
machine and I have performed novelty injuries and wounds in every
centre of civilisation in the Cluster; you may not have this chance
again, you know; we leave tomorrow, and I'm all booked up for the
next two years standard. Are you absolutely sure you don't want to
participate?'</p>
<p>
'More than absolutely.'</p>
<p>
'Leave Mr Staberinde alone, Doctor,' the woman said, 'If he does not
want to join us then we must respect his wishes. Must we not, Mr
Staberinde?' The woman took his arm in hers. He looked at her injury,
wondering what sort of transparent shielding kept everything intact.
Her breasts were frosted with small, tear-shaped gems, and kept high
by tiny field projectors on their undersides.</p>
<p>
'Yes, of course.'</p>
<p>
'Good. Would you wait a moment, please? Please share this.' She
pushed her drink into his hand and stooped forward to talk to the
doctor.</p>
<p>
He turned to look at the people in the room. Strips of flesh hung
from beautiful faces, grafted breasts swung from tanned backs,
slender arms hung like bloated necklaces; chips of bone peeped from
torn skin, veins and arteries and muscles and glands squirmed and
sparkled in the plain light.</p>
<p>
He lifted the glass the woman had given him and wafted some of its
fumes into the fields around the helmet neck; an alarm sounded and a
small screen on the suit's wrist revealed the specific poison in the
glass. He smiled, pushed the glass through the suit's neck-field and
knocked the contents back, then coughed a little as the half-alcohol
concoction went down his throat. He smacked his lips.</p>
<p>
'Oh, you've finished it,' the woman came back to him. She was patting
her smooth belly, now whole again, and motioned him towards another
area of the room. She donned a small, glittering waistcoat as they
walked through the mutilated throng.</p>
<p>
'Yes.' He handed her the glass.</p>
<p>
They went through a door into an old workshop; lathes and punches and
drills stood around under layers of dust and flaking paint and metal.
Three chairs stood under a hanging light, a small cabinet beside
them. The woman shut the door and waved him into one of the low
seats. He sat down, placing the suit helmet on the floor at his side.</p>
<p>
'Why didn't you come in the costume we sent you?' She altered the
lock on the door, then turned to him, suddenly smiling. She adjusted
the glittering waistcoat.</p>
<p>
'It didn't suit me.'</p>
<p>
'You think that does?' she nodded at the black suit as she sat down,
crossing her legs. She tapped the cabinet. It opened out with
chinking glasses and already smoking drug bowls.</p>
<p>
'I find it reassuring.'</p>
<p>
She leant over, offering him a glass of gleaming liquid, which he
accepted. He settled into the chair again.</p>
<p>
She sat back too, cradling a bowl in both hands and closing her eyes
as she leant over it, breathing in deeply. She flapped a little of
the smoke under the lapels of the waistcoat, so that as she spoke the
heavy fumes curled back out between the material and her breasts,
and twisted slowly into her face.</p>
<p>
'We are so glad you could come, whatever your attire. Tell me; how
are you finding the Excelsior? Does it meet with your requirements?'</p>
<p>
He smiled thinly. 'It'll do.'</p>
<p>
The door opened. The man he'd seen with the woman at the street party
and when they had chased him in their car was outside. He stood back
for Mollen to enter before him. Then he strode to the remaining seat
and placed himself in it. Mollen stood near the door.</p>
<p>
'What have you been saying?' the man asked, waving away the woman's
hand with a glass in it.</p>
<p>
'He's about to tell us who he is,' the woman said; they both looked
at him. 'Aren't you, Mr... Staberinde?'</p>
<p>
'No I'm not. You tell me who you are.'</p>
<p>
'I think you know who we are, Mr Staberinde,' the man said. 'We
<I>thought </I>we knew who you were, up until a few hours ago. Now
we're not so sure.'</p>
<p>
'Me, I'm just a tourist.' He sipped at the drink, looking at them
over the top of the glass. He inspected his drink. Minute specks of
gold floated in its glittering depths.</p>
<p>
'For a tourist, you've bought an awful lot of souvenirs that you'll
never be able to take home with you,' the woman said. 'Streets,
railways, bridges, canals, apartment blocks, stores, tunnels.' She
waved her hand in the air to indicate that the list went on. 'And
that's just in Solotol.'</p>
<p>
'I get carried away.'</p>
<p>
'Were you trying to attract attention?'</p>
<p>
He smiled. 'Yes, I suppose I was.'</p>
<p>
'We heard you suffered an unpleasant experience this morning, Mr
Staberinde,' the woman said. She wriggled down deeper into the chair,
drawing up her legs. 'Something to do with a storm-drain.'</p>
<p>
'That's right. My car was diverted down a spillway, from the top.'</p>
<p>
'You weren't hurt?' She sounded sleepy.</p>
<p>
'Not seriously; I stayed in the car until...'</p>
<p>
'No, please.' The hand waved up from the indistinct mass of the
chair, tiredly, 'I have no head for details.'</p>
<p>
He said nothing; he pursed his lips.</p>
<p>
'I understand your driver was not so lucky,' the man said.</p>
<p>
'Well, he's dead.' He leant forward in his seat. 'Actually, I thought
you people might have arranged the whole thing.'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' said the woman from the mass of the chair, her voice floating
up like the smoke, 'Actually we did.'</p>
<p>
'I find frankness so appealing, don't you?' The man looked admiringly
at the knees, breasts and head of the woman, the only parts of her
still showing above the furry arms of the seat. He smiled. 'Of
course, Mr Staberinde, my companion jests. We would never do such a
terrible thing. But we might be able to lend you some assistance in
finding the real culprits.'</p>
<p>
'Really?'</p>
<p>
The man nodded. 'We think now we might like to help you, you see?'</p>
<p>
'Oh, sure.'</p>
<p>
The man laughed. 'Who exactly are you, Mr Staberinde?'</p>
<p>
'I told you; I'm a tourist.' He sniffed the bowl. 'I wandered into a
little money recently, and I always wanted to visit Solotol - in
style - and that's what I've been doing.'</p>
<p>
'How did you get control of the Vanguard Foundation, Mr Staberinde?'</p>
<p>
'I thought direct questions like that were impolite.'</p>
<p>
'They are,' the man smiled. 'I beg your pardon. May I guess your
profession, Mr Staberinde? I mean before you became a gentleman of
leisure, of course.'</p>
<p>
He shrugged. 'If you like.'</p>
<p>
'Computers,' the man said.</p>
<p>
He had started to raise his glass to his lips, just so he could
hesitate, as he now did. 'No comment,' he said, not meeting the man's
eyes.</p>
<p>
'So,' the man said. 'The Vanguard foundation is under new management,
is it?'</p>
<p>
'Damn right. Better management.'</p>
<p>
The man nodded. 'So I heard, just this afternoon.' He sat forward in
his chair and rubbed his hands together. 'Mr Staberinde; I don't want
to pry into your commercial operations and future plans, but I
wonder if you'd give us even a vague idea in what direction you see
the Vanguard Foundation going, over the next few years. Purely as a
matter of interest, for now.'</p>
<p>
'That's easy,' he grinned. 'More profits. Vanguard could have been
the biggest corp of the lot if it had been aggressive with its
marketing. Instead it's been run like a charity; relied on coming up
with some new technological gizmo to restore its position each time
it falls behind. But from now on it fights like the other big boys,
and it backs winners.' (The man nodded wisely.) The Vanguard
Foundation's been too... meek until now.' He shrugged. 'Maybe that's
just what happens when you leave something to be run by machines. But
that's over. From now on the machines do what I tell them to, and the
Vanguard Foundation becomes a competitor; a predator, yeah?' He
laughed, not too harshly, he hoped, conscious he might overdo this.</p>
<p>
The man smiled slowly but broadly. 'You... believe in keeping
machines in their place, yes?'</p>
<p>
'Yeah.' He nodded vigorously. 'Yeah, I do.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm. Mr Staberinde, have you heard of Tsoldrin Beychae?'</p>
<p>
'Sure. Hasn't everybody?'</p>
<p>
The man raised his eyebrows liquidly. 'And you think...?'</p>
<p>
'Could have been a great politician, I suppose.'</p>
<p>
'Most people say he <I>was</I> a great politician,' the woman said
from the chair's depths.</p>
<p>
He shook his head, looking into his drug bowl. 'He was on the wrong
side. It was a shame, but... to be great you have to be on the
winning side. Part of greatness is knowing that. He didn't. Same as
my old man.'</p>
<p>
'Ah...' said the woman.</p>
<p>
'Your father, Mr Staberinde?' the man said.</p>
<p>
'Yeah,' he admitted. 'He and Beychae... well, it's a long story,
but... they knew each other, long ago.'</p>
<p>
'We have time for the story,' the man said easily.</p>
<p>
'No,' he said. He stood up, putting down the bowl and glass, and
taking up the suit helmet. 'Look; thanks for the invitation and all,
but I think I'll head back now; I'm a little tired, and I took a bit
of a battering in that car, you know?'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' the man said, standing too. 'We're really sorry about that.'</p>
<p>
'Oh, thanks.'</p>
<p>
'Perhaps we can offer something in compensation?'</p>
<p>
'Oh yeah? Like what?' He fiddled with the suit helmet. 'I got lots of
money.'</p>
<p>
'How would you like to talk to Tsoldrin Beychae?'</p>
<p>
He looked up, frowning. 'I don't know; should I? Is he here?' He
gestured out towards the party. The woman giggled.</p>
<p>
'No.' The man laughed. 'Not here. But in the city. Would you like to
talk to him? Fascinating fellow, and no longer actively on the wrong
side, as it were. Devoted to a life of study, these days. But still
fascinating, as I say.'</p>
<p>
He shrugged. 'Well... maybe. I'll think about it. It crossed my mind
to leave, after the craziness this morning.'</p>
<p>
'Oh, I beg you to reconsider that, Mr Staberinde. Please; sleep on
it. You might do a great deal of good, for all of us, if you would
talk to the chap. Who knows; you might even help make him great.' He
held out one hand towards the door. 'But I can tell you want to go.
Let me see you to the car.' They walked to the door. Mollen stood
back. 'Oh. This is Mollen. Say hello, Mollen.' The grey-haired man
touched a small box at his side.</p>
<p>
'Hello,' it said.</p>
<p>
'Mollen can't speak, you see. Hasn't said a word in all the time
we've known him.'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' said the woman. She was completely submerged in the chair now.
'We decided he needed to clear his throat; so we took out his
tongue.' She either giggled or belched.</p>
<p>
'We've met.' He nodded to the big man, whose face contorted strangely
under the scars.</p>
<p>
The party in the boat-house cellar went on. He almost collided with a
woman who had her eyes on the back of her head. Some of the revellers
were exchanging limbs now. People sported four arms, or none (begging
for drinks to be brought to their mouths), or an extra leg, or had
arms or legs of the wrong sex. One woman was parading around with a
man in tow who wore a sickly stupid grin; the woman kept lifting her
skirt and displaying a complete set of male sexual equipment.</p>
<p>
He hoped they all forgot who had what at the end of the evening.</p>
<p>
They passed through the tame party, where fireworks were showering
everybody with cool sparks; they were all laughing at that and - he
could think of no other word - cavorting.</p>
<p>
He was wished farewell. It was the same car that took him back,
though it had a different driver. He watched the lights and the
city's calm expanses of snow, and thought about people at parties and
people at war; he saw the party they had just left, and he saw the
grey-green trenches with mud-caked men waiting nervously; he saw
people dressed in shiny black, whipping each other and being tied
up... and he saw people shackled to bed frames or chairs, shrieking,
while the uniformed men applied their particular skills.</p>
<p>
He sometimes had to be reminded, he realised, that he still possessed
the capacity to despise.</p>
<p>
The car powered its way through the silent streets. He took the dark
glasses off. The empty city swept past.</p>

<p>
Once - between the time he'd taken the Chosen across the badlands and
the time he'd ended up broken like an insect in the flooded caldera,
scratching signs in the dirt - he had taken some leave, and for a
while had entertained the idea of giving up his work for the Culture,
and doing something else instead. It had always seemed to him that
the ideal man was either a soldier or a poet, and so, having spent
most of his years being one of those - to him - polar opposites, he
determined to attempt to turn his life around and become the other.</p>
<p>
He lived in a small village, in a small, rural country on a small,
undeveloped, unhurried planet. He stayed with an old couple in a
cottage in the trees in the dales beneath the high tors. He rose
early and went for long walks.</p>
<p>
The countryside looked new and green and fresh; it was summer, and
the fields and woods, the path sides and river banks were full of
unnameable flowers of every colour. The tall trees flexed in the warm
summer winds, leaves bright and fluttering like flags, and water ran
off the moors and hills and across the bunched stones of sparkling
streams like some clarified concentrate of the air itself. He sweated
to the crests of the gnarled hills, climbed the outcrop rocks at
their summits, and ran whooping and laughing across the broader tops,
under the brief shadows of the small high clouds.</p>
<p>
On the moors, in the hills, he saw animals. Tiny ones that darted
invisibly into thickets from almost under-foot, larger ones that
leapt and stopped, looked back, then leapt away again, disappearing
into burrows or between rocks; larger ones still that ran flowing off
across the ground in herds, watching him, and then became almost
invisible when they stopped to graze. Birds mobbed him when he walked
too near their nests; others called out from nearby, one-wing
fluttering, trying to distract him, when he approached theirs. He was
careful not to step on their nests.</p>
<p>
He always took a small notebook with him on his walks, and made a
point of writing down anything interesting. He tried to describe the
feel of the grasses in his fingers, the way the trees sounded, the
visual diversity of the flowers, the way the animals and birds moved
and reacted, the colour of the rocks and the sky. He kept a proper
journal in a larger book, back in his room at the old couple's
cottage. He wrote his notes up in that each evening, as though
filling out a report for some higher authority.</p>
<p>
In another large journal book, he wrote his notes out again, along
with further notes on the notes, and then started to cross words out
of the completed, annotated notes, carefully removing word after word
until he had something that looked like a poem. This was how he
imagined poetry to be made.</p>
<p>
He had brought some books of poetry with him, and when the weather
was wet, which was only rarely, he stayed in and tried to read them.
Usually, though, they sent him to sleep. The books he had brought
<I>about</I> poetry and poets confused him even more, and he had to
continually re-read passage after passage to retain each word, and
even then still felt none the wiser.</p>
<p>
He went into the village tavern every few days, and played skittle
and pebble games with the locals. The mornings after these evenings
he regarded as recovery periods, and left his notebook behind when he
walked.</p>
<p>
The rest of the time he tired himself out and kept fit; climbing
trees to see how high he could get before the branches became too
thin, climbing rock faces and old quarries, balancing his way across
fallen trees in steep gullies, leaping from rock to rock across
rivers, and sometimes stalking and then chasing the animals on the
moor, knowing he could never catch up with them, but laughing as he
sprinted after them.</p>
<p>
The only other people he saw in the hills were farmers and shepherds.
Sometimes he saw slaves working in the fields, and very rarely he met
other people out walking. He didn't like to stop and talk to them.</p>
<p>
The one other person he ever saw regularly was a man who flew a kite
on the high hills. They only saw each other from a distance. At first
it just happened that their paths never crossed, but later he made
sure that they didn't meet; he would change direction if he saw the
gaunt figure of the man walking towards him, climb up a different
hill if he saw the little red kite flying above the summit he'd
intended to head for. It had become a sort of tradition, a little
private custom.</p>
<p>
The days went on. He sat on a hill once, and saw a slave running
through the fields beneath, through the strange slow patterns that
the currents in the wind pushed through the golden-red pelt of the
land. The slave's path left a trail like the wake behind a ship. She
got as far as the river, where the landlord's mounted overseer ran
her down. He watched the overseer beat the woman - saw the long
stick rise and fall, tiny in the distance - but he couldn't hear
anything because the wind was in the wrong direction. When the woman
finally lay still on the river bank, the overseer got down off his
mount and knelt near her head; he saw something flash, but could not
tell exactly what was going on. The overseer rode off; hobbled slaves
came and took the woman away, later.</p>
<p>
He made a note.</p>
<p>
That evening, after dinner in the house of the old couple, once the
wife had gone to bed, he told the old man what he had seen. The man
nodded slowly, chewing on a mildly narcotic root, and spat juice into
the fire. The overseer was known to be strict, the old man said; he
took the tongue of any slave who tried to escape. He kept the tongues
drying on a string stretched over the entrance to the slaves'
compound at the lordship's farm.</p>
<p>
He and the old man drank some fierce grain spirit from little cups,
and then the old man told him a folk tale.</p>
<p>
In the tale, a man walking through the wild wood was tempted from the
path by some beautiful flowers, and then saw a handsome young woman
lying asleep in a clearing. He went to the maiden, and she woke. He
sat down beside her and as they talked he realised that she smelled
of flowers, a perfume more wonderful than anything he had ever
experienced before, and so intense that he was made dizzy by the
heady strength of it. After a while, surrounded by her flowery scent,
enchanted by her softly lilting voice and shy demeanour, he asked to
kiss her, and finally was allowed, and their kisses grew passionate,
and they coupled.</p>
<p>
But as they did so, even from the first moment that joined them,
whenever the man looked out of one eye he saw the woman change. From
one eye she looked as she had from the first, but looking through the
other eye she was older, no longer just past her childhood. With each
beat of their love she grew older (though only seen through one eye),
through her maturity and late glow and the matron look, to spry then
frail old age.</p>
<p>
All the time the man could see her in all her youth by just closing
one eye - and certainly could not stop himself from the act they had
embarked upon - but always he was tempted to sneak a look through the
other eye, and be shocked and amazed at the terrible transformation
taking place beneath him.</p>
<p>
In the last few movements of his knowledge, he closed his eyes, only
opening both at the moment of fulfilment, when he saw - with both
eyes, now - that he had taken to him a rotting corpse, already known
by worms and grubs; the smell of flowers changed in that instant to
an overpowering stench of corruption, but in such a way that he knew
that it had always smelled like that, and as his loins gave
themselves to the corpse, his belly threw out his last meal at the
same time.</p>
<p>
The wood spirit had his life by two strands, therefore, and with both
hands took a firm grip of him, unravelled him from the weave of life,
and dragged him away to the shadow world.</p>
<p>
His soul was shattered into a million pieces there, and thrown over
the world, to make up the souls of all pollen-flies, which bring new
life and old death to flowers, at the same time.</p>
<p>
He thanked the old man for telling him the story, and told him some
tales he remembered from his own upbringing.</p>
<p>
A few days later he was running after one of the small animals on the
moor; it skidded on some dew-wet grass and tumbled end-over-end,
finally falling, limbs spread, on some stones, winding itself. He
gave a victorious, whooping cry and threw himself forward down the
slope towards the animal as it wobbled to its feet; he jumped the
last couple of metres, landing with both feet, just beside where the
animal had fallen; it collected itself and sped off again, unharmed,
and vanished down a hole. He laughed, breathing hard, sweating. He
stood there, put his hands on his knees and bent at the waist, trying
to get his breath back.</p>
<p>
Something moved under his feet. He saw it, felt it.</p>
<p>
There was a nest under him. He had landed right on it. The eggs,
their speckled shells shattered, spread their fluids over his boot
heels and into the twigs and moss.</p>
<p>
He moved his foot, already sick in his heart. Something black
wriggled underneath. It moved into the sunlight; a black head and
neck; a black eye staring up at him, bright and hard as a jet pebble
at the bottom of a brook. The bird struggled, making him jump back a
little, as though he had landed with naked feet on something that
stung; the bird flapped hopelessly out onto the moor grass, hopping
on one foot, dragging one limp wing after it. It stopped, a little
way off, sideways to him, and tipped its head, seeming to regard him.</p>
<p>
He wiped his boots on the moss. All the eggs were smashed. The bird
made a small keening noise. He turned away and began to walk off,
then stopped, cursed, retraced his steps and stamped after the bird,
catching it easily in a storm of squawks and feathers.</p>
<p>
He twisted its neck and dropped the limp remains into the grass.</p>
<p>
That evening he stopped writing his journal and never returned to it.
The weather grew humid and oppressive and no rains fell. The man with
the kite waved and called out to him one day, from the top of a hill;
he hurried away, sweating.</p>
<p>
It was ten or so days after the incident with the bird that he
admitted to himself he would never be a poet.</p>
<p>
He left a couple of days later and was never heard of again, even
though the lord's marshal sent word to every town in the land,
because the stranger was suspected of being involved in what happened
the night he left, when the overseer at the lord's farm was found
trussed in his bed, his face fixed in an expression of darkest
horror, and his mouth and throat stuffed with dried human tongues and
pieces of blank paper, on which he had choked to death.</p>

<p>
He slept until after dawn, then went for a walk to think. He left via
the service tunnel from the main hotel to the annexe, and left the
dark glasses in his pocket. The hotel had cleaned the old raincoat;
he put it on and some thick gloves and wound a scarf round his neck.</p>
<p>
He walked carefully along warmed streets and dripping pavements, and
held his head up to gaze at the sky. His breath went before him.
Little snow-falls slumped off buildings and wires as the weak
sunlight and a mild breeze raised the temperature. The gutters ran
with clear water and soggy bergs of bumping slush; pipes from
buildings ran or dripped with the melt and, when a vehicle passed, it
did so with a wet hiss. He crossed the road to the other side, where
the sun was.</p>
<p>
He climbed steps and crossed bridges; he walked gingerly over icy
parts where there was no heating, or it had failed. He wished he'd
put on better boots; these looked fine but they didn't have enough
grip. To avoid falling you had to walk like an old man, hands splayed
as though trying to grasp a stick, bending at the waist when you
wanted to walk straight-backed. This annoyed him, but walking on
without acknowledging the changed conditions, and slipping on his
backside, appealed to him even less.</p>
<p>
When he did slip, it was in front of some young people. He was
walking carefully down some icy steps leading onto a broad suspension
bridge over a railway junction. The youngsters were walking towards
him, laughing and joking with each other. He divided his attention
between the treacherous steps and the group. They looked very young,
and their actions, gestures and pealing voices all seemed to bubble
with energy, suddenly making him feel his age. There were four of
them; the two young men trying to impress the girls, talking loudly.
One of the girls in particular was tall and dark, and elegant in that
unselfconscious manner of the recently matured. He kept</p>
<p>
his eyes on her, straightening his back, and just before his feet
went out from under him, felt a slight swagger return to his walk.</p>
<p>
He crashed down on the last step, and sat for a moment, then smiled
thinly and got up just before the four young people drew level with
him. (One of the young men was guffawing, making a show of covering
his mufflered mouth with a gloved hand.)</p>
<p>
He brushed some snow from the tails of the raincoat, and flicked some
of it at the young man. They went by and on up the steps, laughing.
He walked halfway across the bridge - grimacing at the pain seeping
up from his backside - and heard a voice call; he turned around and
took a snowball full in the face.</p>
<p>
He caught a glimpse of them laughing as they sprinted away from the
top of the steps, but he was too busy clearing the snow from his
nostrils and stinging eyes to see properly. His nose throbbed
fiercely, but hadn't re-broken. He walked on, passing an older couple
walking arm in arm, who shook their heads and tutted and said
something about damned students. He just nodded to them and wiped his
face with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>
He smiled as he left the bridge, up more steps to an esplanade cut
under old office buildings. Once, he knew, he would have been
embarrassed at what had happened, embarrassed at slipping, at being
seen to slip, at being hit by the snowball after so gullibly turning
round on cue, and at the elderly couple witnessing his embarrassment.
Once he might have chased after the youngsters, to give them a fright
at least, but not now.</p>
<p>
He stopped at a small hot drinks stall set up on the esplanade and
ordered a mug of soup. He leant against the stall and pulled off one
glove with his teeth; he held the steaming mug in his hand, feeling
the warmth. He went to the railings, sat down on a bench and drank
the soup slowly, in careful sips. The man in the soup stall wiped the
counter and listened to the radio, smoking a ceramic cigarette on a
chain round his neck.</p>
<p>
His backside still ached dully from the slip. He smiled at the city
through the steam rising from the mug. Served him right, he told
himself.</p>
<p>
When he got back to the hotel they'd left a message. Mr Beychae would
like to meet him. They would send a car after lunch, unless he
objected.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'This is wonderful news, Cheradenine.'</p>
<p>
'Well, I suppose.'</p>
<p>
'You're not still being pessimistic, are you?'</p>
<p>
'All I'm saying is, don't get your hopes up.' He lay back on the bed
looking at the ceiling paintings, talking to Sma via the earring
transceiver. 'I might just get to meet him, but I doubt I'll have any
chance to get him out. Probably find he's gone senile and says, &quot;Hey,
Zakalwe; still working for the Culture against these gas-heads?&quot;
In which case I want my ass hauled out, all right?'</p>
<p>
'We'll get you out, don't worry about that.'</p>
<p>
'If and when I do get the guy, you still want me to head for the
Impren Habitats?'</p>
<p>
'Yes. You'll have to use the module; we can't risk bringing the
<I>Xenophobe </I>in. If you do spring Beychae they'll be on maximum
alert; we'd never get in and out without being noticed, and that
could swing the whole Cluster against us for interfering.'</p>
<p>
'So how far's Impren by module?'</p>
<p>
'Two days.'</p>
<p>
He sighed. 'I suppose we can handle that.'</p>
<p>
'You all ready, in case you can do anything today?'</p>
<p>
'Yeah. Capsule's buried in the desert and primed; module's hiding in
the nearest gas-giant, waiting for the same signal. If they take the
transceiver from me, how do I get in touch?'</p>
<p>
'Well,' Sma said. 'Much as I'd like to say &quot;I told you so&quot;,
and displace you a scout or knife missile, we can't; their
surveillance might just be good enough to spot it. Best we can do is
put a microsat in orbit and just passive-scan; watch, in other words.
If it sees you in trouble, we'll signal the capsule and the module
for you. The alternative is to use the phone, would you believe.
There's the unlisted Vanguard numbers you already have... Zakalwe?'</p>
<p>
'Hmm?'</p>
<p>
'You do have those numbers?'</p>
<p>
'Oh, yeah.'</p>
<p>
'Or, we've a downlink tap on Solotol's emergency services; just dial
three ones and scream &quot;Zakalwe!&quot; at the operator; we'll
hear.'</p>
<p>
'I am filled with confidence,' he breathed, shaking his head. 'Don't
worry, Cheradenine.'</p>
<p>
'Me, worry?'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The car came; he saw it from his window. He went down to meet Mollen.
He'd liked to have worn the suit again, but doubted they'd let him
into their high security areas wearing it. He took the old raincoat,
and the dark glasses.</p>
<p>
'Hello.'</p>
<p>
'Hello there, Mollen.'</p>
<p>
'A pleasant day.'</p>
<p>
'Yes.'</p>
<p>
'Where are we going?'</p>
<p>
'I don't know.'</p>
<p>
'But you're driving.'</p>
<p>
'Yes.'</p>
<p>
'Then you must know where we're going.'</p>
<p>
'Please repeat that?'</p>
<p>
'I said you must know where you're going if you're driving.'</p>
<p>
'I'm sorry.'</p>
<p>
He stood by the side of the car while Mollen held the door open.</p>
<p>
'Well, at least tell me whether it's very far, I may want to tell
people I won't be back for a while.'</p>
<p>
The large man frowned, the scarred face creasing in strange
directions, unusual patterns. He hesitated over which button on the
box to press. Mollen's tongue licked his lips as he concentrated. So
they had not literally taken his tongue out, after all.</p>
<p>
He assumed whatever was wrong with Mollen was to do with his vocal
chords. Why the man's superiors hadn't just fitted him with an
artificial or re-grown set he couldn't deduce, unless they preferred
their underlings to have a limited set of replies. Certainly they'd
have a hard time speaking ill of you.</p>
<p>
'Yes.'</p>
<p>
'Yes it's far away?'</p>
<p>
'No.'</p>
<p>
'Make up your mind.' He stood with his hand on the open car door,
indifferent to his unkindness to the grey-haired man; he rather
wanted to test his inbuilt vocabulary.</p>
<p>
'I'm sorry.'</p>
<p>
'Is it quite close then, within the city?'</p>
<p>
The scarred face frowned again. Mollen tutted with his lips and
pressed another set of buttons with an apologetic look. 'Yes.'</p>
<p>
'Within the city?'</p>
<p>
'Perhaps.'</p>
<p>
'Thank you.'</p>
<p>
'Yes.'</p>
<p>
He got in. It was a different car to that he'd been in the night
before. Mollen got into the separate driver's compartment and belted
himself in carefully; he pedalled a gear and drew smoothly away. A
couple of other cars followed immediately behind them, then stopped
at the entrance to the first street they took outside the hotel,
blocking the cars of the pursuing media people.</p>
<p>
He was watching the small, high specks of wheeling birds when the
view started to disappear. At first he thought that black screens
were rising outside the windows behind and to either side of him.
Then he saw the bubbles; it was some black liquid which was filling
the space between the double-layers of glass in the back of the car.
He pressed the button to talk to Mollen. 'Hey!' he shouted.</p>
<p>
The black liquid was halfway up the screens, gradually rising between
him and Mollen as well as on the other three sides.</p>
<p>
'Yes?' Mollen said.</p>
<p>
He grabbed a door handle. The door opened; a draft of cold air
whistled in. The black liquid continued to fill the space between the
panes of glass. 'What is this?'</p>
<p>
He saw Mollen carefully pressing a button on his voice synthesiser,
before the liquid blocked the view forward.</p>
<p>
'Do not be alarmed, Mr Staberinde. This is just a precaution, to
ensure that Mr Beychae's privacy is respected,' said an obviously
prepared message.</p>
<p>
'Hmm. Okay.' He shrugged; he shut the door and was left in the dark
until a small light came on. He sat back and did nothing. The
unexpectedness of the blacking out was perhaps meant to frighten him,
perhaps designed to see what he would do.</p>
<p>
They drove on; the yellow light of the small bulb gave a stale, warm
feel to the interior of the car, which although large</p>
<p>
was made to seem small by the absence of an exterior view; he turned
up the ventilation, sat back again. He kept the dark glasses on.</p>
<p>
They turned corners, zoomed and dived, boomed through tunnels and
over bridges. He guessed he noticed the vehicle's motions more
because of the lack of any outside reference.</p>
<p>
They echoed through a tunnel for a long time, going downwards in what
felt like a straight line but could have been a wide spiral, then the
car stopped. There was a moment of silence, then some indistinct
noises from outside, perhaps including voices, before they moved
forward again a short way. The transceiver jabbed delicately at his
ear-lobe. He pushed the bead further into his ear. 'X-ray radiation,'
the earring whispered.</p>
<p>
He allowed himself a small smile. He waited for them to open the door
and demand the transceiver... but the car only moved forward a little
again.</p>
<p>
The vehicle dropped. Its engine was silent; he presumed they were in
a large elevator. They stopped, moved forward again, still silent,
paused, then carried on forward and down. This time the spiral was
obvious. There was still no noise from the vehicle's engine, so they
were either being towed, or freewheeling.</p>
<p>
The black liquid drained slowly from the windows as they drew to a
halt. They were in a wide tunnel under long white strip lights. The
tunnel extended back until it started to curve, forward until it
ended before large metal doors.</p>
<p>
Mollen was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>
He tested the car door, opened it, stepped out.</p>
<p>
The tunnel was warm, though the air seemed fresh enough. He took off
the old raincoat. He looked at the metal doors. Set into them was a
smaller door. There was no handle to pull, so he pushed it, but
nothing happened. He went back to the car, found the horns, blew
them.</p>
<p>
The noise crashed into the tunnel, rang in his ears, echoing. He sat
in the back of the car.</p>
<p>
After a while, the woman came through the small door. She came to the
car, looked in through the window.</p>
<p>
'Hello.'</p>
<p>
'Good afternoon. Here I am.'</p>
<p>
'Yes. And still wearing your glasses.' She smiled. 'Please; come with
me,' she said, and walked quickly off. He collected the old raincoat
and followed.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Behind the doors the tunnel went on, then they came to doors set into
the side of the wall; a small elevator took them down still further.
The woman wore a straight, all-covering gown in black with thin white
stripes.</p>
<p>
The lift stopped. They entered a small hallway like that of a private
house, set about with pictures and potted plants and finished in
streaky, smokily smooth stone. A thick carpet smothered their
footsteps as they went down some steps and onto a large balcony set
halfway up the wall of a large hall; everywhere else the hall was
covered with books or tables, and they walked down a staircase with
books below the wood under their feet, books above the wood over
their heads.</p>
<p>
She guided him round floor-standing book-stacks, and led him to a
table with chairs around it. A machine stood on the table-top with a
small screen set into it and spools scattered about it.</p>
<p>
'Wait here, please.'</p>
<p>
Beychae was in his bedroom, resting. The old man - bald, face deeply
lined, dressed in robes which hid the modest paunch he'd developed
since he'd devoted himself to study - blinked as she tapped at and
opened the door. His eyes were still bright.</p>
<p>
'Tsoldrin. I'm so sorry to disturb you. Come and see who I've brought
to see you.'</p>
<p>
He came with her along the corridor, and stood at the door while the
woman pointed to the man standing at the table with the tape-reading
screen on it.</p>
<p>
'Do you know him?'</p>
<p>
Tsoldrin Beychae put on some glasses - he was old-fashioned enough
to wear his age rather than try to disguise it - and peered at the
man. The fellow was fairly young, long-legged, dark-haired - the hair
swept back, held in a pony-tail - and possessed a striking, even
handsome face, darkened by the sort of beard-growth that never
disappears through surface shaving alone. The lips were disquieting,
looked at exclusively; they appeared cruel and arrogant, and only
when the eye took in the rest of the face as well did this impression
seem too severe, and - reluctantly, perhaps - the observer had to
allow that the dark glasses could not completely hide wide eyes and
full brows, which - open and obvious - made the complete impression
not disagreeable.</p>
<p>
'I might have met him, I'm not sure,' Beychae said slowly. He thought
that perhaps he had met the man before; there was something
worryingly familiar about that face, even behind the shades.</p>
<p>
'He wants to meet you,' the woman said. 'I took the liberty of
telling him it was mutual. He thinks you might have known his
father.'</p>
<p>
'His father?' Beychae said. That might account for it; perhaps the
fellow bore a resemblance to somebody he'd known, and that accounted
for the odd, slightly disturbing feeling he was experiencing. 'Well,'
he said, 'Let's see what he has to say for himself, shall we?'</p>
<p>
'Why not?' the woman said. They walked out into the centre of the
library. Beychae drew himself up; he'd noticed that he was stooping
more these days, but he was still vain enough to want to greet people
straight-backed. The man turned round towards them. 'Tsoldrin
Beychae,' the woman said; 'Mr Staberinde.'</p>
<p>
'An honour, sir,' he said, looking at Beychae with a strange, intense
expression, his face tight-looking, wary. He took the older man's
hand in his.</p>
<p>
The woman looked puzzled. The expression on Beychae's old, lined face
was unreadable. He stood looking at the man, his hand limp in the
other's grip.</p>
<p>
'Mr... Staberinde,' Beychae said, flatly.</p>
<p>
Beychae turned to the woman in the long black gown. 'Thank you.'</p>
<p>
'My pleasure,' she murmured, and backed away.</p>
<p>
He could see Beychae knew. He turned and walked towards an aisle
between the book-stacks, and watched Beychae follow him, eyes full of
wonderment. He stood between the shelved books, and - as though it
might have been an unconscious movement - tapped his ear as he spoke
to Beychae. 'I think you may have known my... ancestor. He went by a
different name.' He took off the dark glasses.</p>
<p>
Beychae looked at him. His expression did not change. 'I think I
did,' Beychae said, glancing round the space behind him. He indicated
a table and chairs. 'Please; let's sit down.'</p>
<p>
He replaced the glasses.</p>
<p>
'So what brings you here, Mr Staberinde?'</p>
<p>
He sat down across the table from the older man. 'Curiosity, as far
as you're concerned. What brought me to Solotol was... just an urge
to see it. I'm, ah... connected with the Vanguard Foundation; there
have been some changes at the top there. I don't know if you've
heard.'</p>
<p>
The old man shook his head. 'No; I don't keep up with the news, down
here.'</p>
<p>
'Yes.' He made a show of looking around. 'I guess...' he looked back
into Beychae's eyes '... I guess it isn't the best place for
communication, hmm?'</p>
<p>
Beychae opened his mouth, then looked annoyed. He glanced behind him.
'Perhaps not,' he agreed. He stood up again. 'Excuse me.'</p>
<p>
He watched the older man go. He forced himself to sit where he was.</p>
<p>
He looked round the library. So many old books; they smelled. So many
words set down, so many lives spent scribbling, so many eyes dimmed
by reading. He wondered that people bothered as much as they did.</p>
<p>
'Now?' he heard the woman say.</p>
<p>
'Why not?'</p>
<p>
He turned in the seat to watch Beychae and the woman emerge from the
stacks. 'Well, Mr Beychae,' the woman said. 'It might be awkward...'</p>
<p>
'Why? Have the elevators stopped working?'</p>
<p>
'No, but...'</p>
<p>
'Then what's to stop us? Let's go; I haven't seen the surface for too
long.'</p>
<p>
'Ah. Well, all right... I'll make the arrangements.' She smiled
uncertainly, then walked away.</p>
<p>
'Well, Z... Staberinde,' Beychae sat down again, smiling
apologetically for an instant. 'We'll take a little trip to the
surface, shall we?'</p>
<p>
'Yeah; why not?' he said, carefully not looking too enthusiastic.
'You keeping well, Mr Beychae? I heard you retired.'</p>
<p>
They talked generally for a few minutes, then a young blonde woman
walked out of the stacks, arms loaded with books. She blinked hard
when she saw him, then came over behind Beychae, who looked up and
smiled at her. 'Ah; my dear; this is Mr... Staberinde.' Beychae
smiled diffidently at him. 'My assistant, Ms Ubrel Shiol.'</p>
<p>
'Delighted,' he nodded.</p>
<p>
Shit, he thought.</p>
<p>
Ms Shiol put the books down on the table and put her hand on
Beychae's shoulder. The old man put his own thin fingers on top of
hers.</p>
<p>
'I hear we might be taking a trip up to the city,' the woman said.
She looked down at the old man, smoothed her plain smock dress with
her other hand. 'This is very sudden.'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' Beychae agreed. He smiled up at her. 'You'll find that old men
still retain the ability to surprise, on occasion.'</p>
<p>
'It'll be cold,' the woman said, drawing away. 'I'll fetch your warm
clothes.'</p>
<p>
Beychae watched her go. 'Wonderful girl,' he said. 'Don't know what
I'd do without her.'</p>
<p>
'Indeed,' he replied. <I>You may have to learn</I>, he thought.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The journey back up to the surface took an hour to arrange. Beychae
seemed excited. Ubrel Shiol made him put on warm clothes, changed out
of her smock into a one-piece, and put her hair up. They took the
same car; Mollen drove. He, Beychae and Ms Shiol sat on the broad
rear bench; the woman in the black robe sat across from them.</p>
<p>
They left the tunnel for the bright light of day; snow covered a
broad yard with tall wire gates before them. Security men watched the
car go past as the gates opened. The car set off down a side road for
the nearest turnpike, then stopped at the junction.</p>
<p>
'Is there a fair on anywhere?' Beychae asked. 'I always enjoyed the
noise and bustle of fairs.'</p>
<p>
He recalled there was some sort of travelling circus camped in a
meadow down near the river Lotol. He suggested they went there.
Mollen turned the car onto the broad, almost empty boulevard.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Flowers,' he said, suddenly.</p>
<p>
They all looked at him.</p>
<p>
He'd put his arm back on the seat, behind Beychae and Urbrel Shiol,
and brushed Shiol's hair, dislodging a clasp Shiol had secured her
hair with. He laughed, and retrieved the clasp from the shelf under
the car's rear window. The manoeuvre had given him the chance to look
back.</p>
<p>
There was a large half-track vehicle following them. 'Flowers, Mr
Staberinde?' the woman in the black robe said. 'I'd like to buy some
flowers,' he said, smiling first at her, then at Shiol. He clapped
his hands. 'Why not? To the Flower Market, Mollen!' He sat back,
smiling beatifically. Then he sat forward, all apologetic. 'If that's
all right,' he said to the woman.</p>
<p>
She smiled. 'Of course. Mollen; you heard.' The car turned down
another road.</p>
<p>
In the Flower Market, amongst the packed and flurried stalls, he
bought flowers and presented them to the woman and to Ubrel Shiol.
'There's the fair!' he said, pointing over the river, where the tents
and holograms of the fair sparkled and rotated.</p>
<p>
As he'd hoped, they took the Flower Market Ferry. It was a tiny,
one-vehicle platform. He looked back at the half-track waiting on the
other side.</p>
<p>
The far bank. They drove towards the fair; Beychae chattered,
remembering fairs from his youth for Ubrel Shiol.</p>
<p>
'Thank you for my flowers, Mr Staberinde,' the woman sitting across
from him said, putting them to her face and breathing in their scent.</p>
<p>
'My pleasure,' he said, then leant across Shiol to tap Beychae on the
arm, to attract his attention to a piece of fairground equipment
wheeling into the sky over some nearby roofs. The car drew to a stop
at a light-controlled junction.</p>
<p>
He reached across Shiol again, pulled down a zip before she realised
what was happening, and extracted the gun he'd already felt there. He
looked at it and started to laugh, as though the whole thing was a
silly mistake, then turned it and fired at the glass screen behind
Mollen's head.</p>
<p>
The glass shattered. He was already kicking through it, launching
himself from the seat and lancing forward with one leg. His foot
crashed through the disintegrating glass and connected with Mollen's
head.</p>
<p>
The car leapt forward, then stalled. Mollen slumped. The instant of
stunned silence lasted just long enough for him to shout, 'Capsule;
<I>here</I>!'</p>
<p>
The woman across from him moved; her hand dropped the flowers and
went to her waist and a fold in the robe. He punched her in the jaw,
sending her head cracking back against the still intact part of the
glass screen behind her. He swivelled, crouched near the door, as the
woman slid unconscious to the floor beside him and the flowers
spilled across the footwell. He looked back at Beychae and Shiol.
Both their mouths were open. 'Change of plan,' he said, taking off
the dark glasses and throwing them onto the floor.</p>
<p>
He dragged them both out. Shiol was screaming. He threw her against
the rear of the car.</p>
<p>
Beychae found his voice; 'Zakalwe, what the hell do you...'</p>
<p>
'She had <I>this</I>, Tsoldrin!' he yelled back, flourishing the gun.</p>
<p>
Ubrel Shiol used the second or so that the gun wasn't pointing at her
to stab a kick at his head. He dodged it, let the woman spin, then
cracked her, open handed, across the neck. She crumpled. The flowers
he had given her rolled under the car.</p>
<p>
'Ubrel!' Beychae shrieked, falling to the woman's side. 'Zakalwe!
What have you done to...'</p>
<p>
'Tsoldrin...' he began. The driver's door burst open and Mollen
launched himself at him. They tumbled across the road into the
gutter; the gun went spinning.</p>
<p>
He found himself wedged against the kerb, Mollen above him, bunching
his lapels in one hand, the other arm swinging up, the voice machine
swinging out on a lanyard as the huge, scarred fist plunged
downwards.</p>
<p>
He feinted, then flung himself in the other direction. He jumped up
as Mollen's fist hit the kerb stones.</p>
<p>
'Hello,' said Mollen's voice box as it clattered into the road
surface.</p>
<p>
He tried to steady, aiming a kick at Mollen's head, but he was
off-balance. Mollen caught his foot with his good hand. He wriggled
out of the grip, but only by turning away.</p>
<p>
'Pleased to meet you,' the box said, swinging again as Mollen rose,
shaking his head.</p>
<p>
He aimed another kick at Mollen's head. 'What do you require?' The
machine said, as Mollen dodged the kick and threw himself forwards.
He dived, skidded across the concrete road surface, rolled and stood.</p>
<p>
Mollen faced him; his neck was bloody. He staggered, then seemed to
remember something, and dug inside his tunic.</p>
<p>
'I am here to help you,' said the voice box.</p>
<p>
He flung himself forward, smashing a fist into Mollen's head as the
big man turned, loosing a small gun from his tunic. He was too far
away to grab it, so he pivoted and swung one foot, connecting with
the gun in the man's fist and forcing his hand up. The grey-haired
man staggered back, looking pained and rubbing his wrist.</p>
<p>
'My name is Mollen. I cannot speak.'</p>
<p>
He'd hoped the kick might have dislodged the gun from Mollen's grip
but it didn't. Then he realised that directly behind him were Beychae
and the unconscious Shiol; he stood for a second while Mollen aimed
the gun at him, waggling his body one way then the other, so that
Mollen, shaking his head again, let his hand waver on the gun.</p>
<p>
'Pleased to meet you.'</p>
<p>
He dived at Mollen's legs. Collided satisfactorily.</p>
<p>
'No, thank you.' They crashed into the kerb-side. 'Excuse me...'</p>
<p>
He brought his fist up, tried to whack the man across the head again.</p>
<p>
'Could you tell me where this is?'</p>
<p>
But Mollen rolled. His punch sailed through air. Mollen shifted and
almost head-butted him. He had to duck, hitting his head against the
kerb-stones.</p>
<p>
'Yes, please.'</p>
<p>
He splayed his fingers as his head rang with light, flung them out
where he thought Mollen's eyes ought to be, and felt something
connect liquidly. Mollen screamed.</p>
<p>
'I cannot reply to that.'</p>
<p>
He bounced up using hands and feet, kicking out at Mollen as he did
so.</p>
<p>
'Thank you.' His foot slammed into Mollen's head. 'Would you repeat
that, please?'</p>
<p>
Mollen rolled slowly into the gutter and lay still. 'What time is
it?' What time is it? What time is it?'</p>
<p>
He stood up shakily on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>
'My name is Mollen. Can I help you? You are not allowed in here. This
is private property. Where do you think you are going? Stop or I
shoot. Money is no object. We have powerful friends. Could you direct
me to the nearest telephone? I'll fuck you harder all right, bitch;
feel this.'</p>
<p>
He smashed Mollen's voice machine with one boot.</p>
<p>
'Graap! No user-serviceable components ins -'</p>
<p>
Another stamp silenced it.</p>
<p>
He looked up at Beychae, who was crouched by the side of the car,
Ubrel Shiol's head cradled in his lap.</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe! You madman!' Beychae screeched.</p>
<p>
He dusted himself down, looked back in the direction of the hotel.
'Tsoldrin,' he said calmly. 'This is an emergency.'</p>
<p>
'What have you done?' Beychae - eyes wide, face aghast - screamed at
him, glancing from Shiol's inert form to Mollen's, then taking a
detour via the slumped feet of the woman lying unconscious in the
car, flowers scattered around her feet, before returning to Shiol's
already bruised neck.</p>
<p>
He looked to the sky. He saw a speck. Relieved, he turned back to
Beychae. 'They were about to kill you,' he told him. 'I was sent to
stop them. We have about...'</p>
<p>
There was a noise beyond the buildings shielding the river and the
Flower Market; a bang and a whoosh. They both looked to the sky; the
enlarging speck that was the capsule blossomed with light on a stalk
that led back behind the buildings towards the Flower Market. The
capsule sailed through the resulting incandescent bloom, seemed to
shake itself, then a lance of light darted from it back down the same
line, as though in reply.</p>
<p>
The sky above the Flower Market flared; the road underneath them
bounced, and a terrific crack of sound burst over the roadway and
rolled back from cliffs further up the slope city.</p>
<p>
'We had about a minute,' he said, breathless, 'before we had to
leave.' The capsule swooped from the sky, a four-metre cylinder of
darkness impacting on the road surface. Its hatches opened. He went
to it and took out a very large gun. He touched a couple of controls.
'Now we have no time.'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe!' Beychae said, voice suddenly controlled. 'Are you insane?'</p>
<p>
A tearing, screaming noise came above the city, from up-canyon. They
both looked up at a slim shape streaking towards them, bellying down
through the air.</p>
<p>
He spat into the gutter. He raised the plasma rifle, sighted at the
fast approaching dot, and fired.</p>
<p>
A bolt of light leapt from gun to sky; the aircraft burst smoke, and
veered away on a helix of debris, crashing somewhere down-canyon in
a scream that became thunder, echoes rolling back from all over the
city.</p>
<p>
He looked back at the old man.</p>
<p>
'What was the question again?'</p>

<p>
The black fabric of the tent roof was above him and yet he could see
through it to the sky, which was the shaded blue of day, and bright,
but black as well because he could see through that easy blueness,
and beyond was a darkness more profound than that inside the tent, a
darkness where the scattered suns burned, tiny firefly lights in the
cold black empty deserts of the night.</p>
<p>
A dark crop of stars reached out towards him, picked him up softly
between vast fingers like some delicate ripe fruit. In that immense
enfolding he felt deliriously sane, and understood then that in an
instant - any instant, and with only the most minute of efforts - he
might understand everything, but did not desire to. He felt as though
some awesome galaxy-quaking machinery, always hidden under the
surface of the universe, had somehow connected itself to him, and
dusted him with its power.</p>
<p>
He sat in a tent. His legs were crossed, his eyes were closed. He had
sat like this for days now. He wore a loose-fitting robe, like the
nomad people. His uniform lay neatly folded a metre behind him. His
hair was short; stubble grew on his face, and there was a sheen of
sweat on his skin. It seemed to him that sometimes he was outside of
himself, looking back at his body, sitting there on the cushions
under the dark fabric roof. His face grew darker because the black
hairs grew through the skin, yet looked lighter because the film of
sweat on it glistened in the lights of the lamps and the smoke-hole
in the roof. This adversarial symbiosis, competition creating stasis,
amused him. He would rejoin his body, or set off further afield, with
a sense of Tightness at the core of things.</p>
<p>
The tent was dark inside, filled with a thick and heavy atmosphere at
once stale and sweet; heavy with perfume, smoky with incense. All was
sweet and rich and highly decorated; the hanging rugs were thick and
picked out with many colours and precious metal thread; the carpet
was piled like a field of golden grain, and the plump, scented
cushions and languorously thick coverings made a fabulously patterned
landscape under the dark flute of roof. Small censers smoked lazily;
little night-heaters sat extinguished, dream-leaf holders and crystal
chalices, jewelled boxes and clasped books were strewn across the
undulating fabric landscape like glittering temples on the plains.</p>
<p>
Lies. The tent was bare and he sat on a sack stuffed with straw.</p>
<p>
The girl watched him move. It was a hypnotic movement, barely
noticeable at first, but once you had seen it, once the eye grew
accustomed to it, it became very obvious and quite fascinating. He
moved from the waist, round and round, neither slowly nor quickly,
his head describing a flattened circle. It reminded the girl of the
way that, sometimes, rising smoke would begin to twist as it rose
towards the hole in the roof of a tent. The man's eyes seemed to move
in compensation for this subtle, ceaseless motion, shifting tinily
behind the brown-pink lids.</p>
<p>
The tent was just big enough for the girl to stand up in. It was
pitched at a crossroads in the desert, where two tracks crossed the
sea of sand. It would have been a town or even a city long since, but
the nearest water was three days' ride away. The tent had been here
for four days, and might be here another two or three, depending on
how long the man stayed in the dream-leaf sleep. She took up a
pitcher from a small tray and filled a cup with water. She went over
to the man, and put the cup to his lips, holding one hand under his
chin as she carefully tipped the cup.</p>
<p>
The man drank, still moving. He turned his face away after he'd drunk
half the water in the cup. She took a cloth and dabbed at his face,
removing a little of the sweat.</p>
<p>
Chosen, he said to himself. Chosen, Chosen, Chosen. A long way to a
strange place. Taking the Chosen one through the scorching dust and
the mad tribes of the badlands to the lush meadows and gleaming
spires of the Perfumed Palace on the cliff. Now he reaped a little
reward.</p>
<p>
The tent sits between the trade routes, outside turned in for the
season, and in the tent sits a man, a soldier, back from uncounted
wars, scarred and seared and broken and healed and broken and healed
and repaired and made good again... and for once he was unwary, guard
down, committing his mind to a wild, affecting drug, and his body to
the care and protection of a young girl.</p>
<p>
The girl, whose name he did not know, brought water to his lips and a
cool cloth to his brow. He remembered a fever, a hundred and more
years ago, a thousand and more years away, and the hands of another
girl, cool and tender, soothing and smoothing. He heard the lawn
birds keen from the grounds outside the great house that lay in the
estate cradled in the broad river's bend; an oxbow of calm in the
livid landscape of his memories.</p>
<p>
Torpor-heavy, the drug flowed through him, winding and unwinding, a
current of random ordering. (He remembered a stone beach on the
river's banks, where the ever-flowing water had swept silt, sand,
gravel, pebbles, stones and boulders in a linear progression of size
and weight, ordering - through its steady, liquid weight - the
elemental stone in a curve, like something distributed on a graph.)</p>
<p>
The girl watched and waited, calm that the stranger had taken to the
drug like one of their own, and was himself calm under its influence.
She hoped this was, as he seemed to be, an exceptional man, and not
an ordinary one, for that would imply their nomad kind was not the
uniquely strong race they believed they were.</p>
<p>
She had feared the power of the drug would be too much for him, and
that he would shatter like a red-glowing cooking pot dropped into
water, the way she had heard other strangers had, vainly thinking the
dream-leaf was just another dalliance in their self-indulgent lives.
But he had not fought it. For one who was a soldier, used to
fighting, he had displayed a rare insight in just giving in without a
struggle, and accepting the prescriptions of the drug. She admired
this in an outsider. She doubted the conquerors would be so pliably
strong. Even some of their own young men - often the most impressive,
in every other way - could not accept the crushing gifts the
dream-leaf brought, and yelped and gibbered through an abbreviated
nightmare, mewling for their mother's breast, pissing and shitting
and crying and screaming their most shaming fears to the desert
winds. The drug was rarely fatal, in the supervised quantities that
had become ritual, but the after-effects could be; more than one
young brave had chosen the blade in the belly to the disgrace of
knowing a leaf had been stronger than he.</p>
<p>
It was, she reflected, a pity that this man was not one of their own
kind; he might have made a good husband, and sired many strong sons
and cunning daughters. Many marriages were made in dream-leaf tents,
and she had at first taken it as an insult that she had been asked to
shepherd the stranger through his leaf-days, until she'd been
convinced it was an honour, that he had done their people a great
service, and she would be allowed her pick of the tribe's young
novitiates, when their testing time came.</p>
<p>
And, when he took the dream-leaf, he had insisted on the stage that
they normally reserved for their elder soldiers and matriarchs; no
child's dose for him. She watched him circle, flexing continually
from the waist, as though he sought to stir something in his brain.</p>
<p>
By the roads, by the crossed signs of those single lines, worn by
trade, commerce and passing knowledge; thin trails in the dust, pale
marks in the brown page of the desert. The tent stood in Summer, when
the white side was turned out and the black side in. In Winter it was
outside-in.</p>
<p>
He imagined that he felt his brain revolve inside his skull.</p>
<p>
In the white tent that was black, and both at once, by the crossroads
on the desert, a white/black impermanence like a fallen leaf before
the winds blow, trembling in the breeze beneath the poised wave that
was the stone circumference of mountains, capped by snow and ice like
foam frozen in the high thin air.</p>
<p>
He swept away, leaving the tent, so that it fell away beneath him,
became a speck beside the thin trails in the dust, and the mountains
swam past, white capping ochre, and the trails and the tent
disappeared, and the mountains shrank, and the glaciers and the
starveling snows of summer became white claws on the rock, and the
curved edge pressed in, compressing the view, so that the globe
beneath became a coloured boulder, stone, pebble, gravel, grain of
sand, speck of silt-dust, then was lost in the sandstorm whirl of the
great revolving lens that was the home of all of them, which itself
became a fleck on a thin bubble surrounding emptiness, skeined to its
lonely siblings by the fabric that was only a slimly different
articulation of nothingness.</p>
<p>
More specks. All vanished. Darkness reigned.</p>
<p>
He was still there.</p>
<p>
Beneath it all, he'd been told, was more. All you had to do, Sma
said, was think in seven dimensions and see the whole universe as a
line on the surface of a torus, starting at a point, becoming a
circle as it was born, then expanding, moving up the inside of the
torus, over the top, to the outside, then relapsing, falling back in,
shrinking. Others had gone before it, others came after it (the
greater/smaller spheres outside of/inside their own universe, seen in
four dimensions). Different time-scales lived outside and inside the
torus; some universes expanding forever, others living less than a
blink of an eye.</p>
<p>
But it was too much. It all meant too much to matter. He had to
concentrate on what he knew and what he was and what he had become,
for the moment at least.</p>
<p>
He found a sun, a planet, out of all that existence, and fell towards
it, knowing this was the place, the font of all his dreams and
memories.</p>
<p>
He searched for meaning, found ashes. Where does it hurt? Well, just
<I>here</I>, actually. A wrecked summerhouse, smashed and burned. No
sign of a chair.</p>
<p>
Sometimes, like now, the banality of it all quite took his breath
away. He stopped and checked, for there were drugs that did that;
took your breath away. He was still breathing. Probably his body was
already set up to ensure that anyway, but the Culture - Chaos bless
it twice - had set up a further program in him, to make certain.
Cheating, as far as these people were concerned (he saw the girl in
front of him, and watched her, through mostly-closed eyes, then
closed again), but that was just too bad; he'd done something for
them, little though they really knew it, and now they could do
something for him.</p>
<p>
But the throne, Sma had said once, is the ultimate symbol for many
cultures. To sit, in splendour, is the highest articulation of
power. The rest come to you; lower, often bowing, frequently backing
off, sometimes prostrate (though that is always a bad sign, said the
Culture's blessed statistics), and to sit, to be made less animal by
that evolutionarily uncalled-for posture, signified the ability to
use.</p>
<p>
There were some small civilisations - barely more than tribes, Sma
had said - where they slept sitting, in special sleep chairs, because
they believed that to lie down was to die (did they not always find
the dead lying down?).</p>
<p>
Zakalwe (was that really his name? It suddenly sounded strange and
alien in his remembrance), Zakalwe, Sma said, I visited a place (how
had they come to this? What had made him mention anything about this?
Had he been drunk? Guard down again? Probably trying to seduce Sma,
but ended up under the table again), Zakalwe I once visited a place
where they killed people by putting them in a chair. Not torture -
that was common enough; beds and chairs were very much the par when
it came to getting people helpless and confined, to inflict pain upon
them - but actually set it up to kill them while they sat. They - get
this - they either gassed them or they passed very high electric
currents through them. A pellet dropped into a container beneath the
seat, like some obscene image of a commode, producing a fatal gas; or
a cap over their head, and their hands dipped in some conducting
fluid, to fry their brains.</p>
<p>
You want to know the punch-line? Yeah, Sma, give us the punch-line.
This same state had a law that forbade - and I quote - 'cruel and
unusual punishments!' Can you believe that?</p>
<p>
He circled around the planet, so far away.</p>
<p>
Then fell towards it, through the air to the ground.</p>
<p>
He found the shell of the mansion, like a forgotten skull; he found
the wrecked summerhouse, like a shattered skull; he found the stone
boat, like a deserted image of a skull. Fake. It was never floating.</p>
<p>
He saw another boat; a ship; a hundred thousand tonnes of
destruction, sitting in its own dry image of desuetude, its layers
bristling outwards. Primary, secondary, tertiary, anti-aircraft,
small...</p>
<p>
He circled, then tried to approach, zeroing in...</p>
<p>
But there were too many layers, and they defeated him.</p>
<p>
He was thrown out again, and had to circle the planet once more, and
as he did so, saw the Chair, and saw the Chairmaker - not the one
he'd thought of, before; the other Chairmaker, the real one, and one
that he had to keep returning to, through all the memories - in all
his ghastly glory.</p>
<p>
But some things were too much.</p>
<p>
Some things were too much to bear.</p>
<p>
Damn people. Damn others. Damn there being other people.</p>
<p>
Back to the girl. (Why did there have to be other people?)</p>
<p>
Yes she still had little experience as a guider-through, but as a
stranger the man had been given to her, because they thought she was
the best of the untried. But she would show them. Perhaps, through
this, they were already considering her for the Matriarchs.</p>
<p>
She would lead them one day. She felt this in her bones. The same
bones that ached when she saw a child fall; the same ache in her
cupped child-bones that came when she saw someone fall hard to the
ground, would be her guide through the politics and tribulations of
the tribe. She would prevail. Like this man here in front of her, but
different. She had that inner strength, too. She would lead her
people; it was like a child inside her, growing, that certainty. She
would stir her people against the conquerors; she would show their
brief hegemony for what it was; a side-track on the desert trail that
was their destiny. The people beyond the plains, in their corrupt
perfumed palace on the cliff, would fall beneath them. The power and
thought of the women, and the power and bravery of their men - desert
thorns - would crush the decadent petal-people of the cliffs. The
sands would be theirs again. Temples would be carved in her name.</p>
<p>
Lies. The girl was young and knew nothing of the tribes' thoughts or
destiny. She was a scrap thrown to him, to ease his passage into what
they imagined would be his death-dream. Her vanquished people's fate
scarcely mattered to her; they had replaced that ancient heritage
with thoughts of prestige and gadgets.</p>
<p>
Let her dream. He relaxed into the calm frenzy of the drug.</p>
<p>
There was a nexus where the vanishing-point of memory met the
time-light from another place, and he was not yet sure he had out-run
it.</p>
<p>
He tried to see the great house again, but it was obscured by smoke
and star-shell. He looked to the great battleship, confined within
its dry-land dock, but it would not grow any larger. It was a capital
ship, no more, no less, and he could not access the depths of meaning
that it really held for him.</p>
<p>
All he'd done was take the Chosen across the wastes to the Palace.
Why had they wanted the Chosen to get to the court? It seemed absurd.
The Culture did not believe in such supernatural, superstitious
nonsense. But the Culture required him to make sure the Chosen got to
the Court, despite all sorts of nastiness getting in his way.</p>
<p>
To perpetuate a corrupt line. To carry on a reign of stupidness.</p>
<p>
Well, they had their own reasons. You took the money and ran. Except
there was no money, as such. What was a boy to do?</p>
<p>
Believe. Though they scorned belief. Do. Act, though they were wary
of action. He was their whipper boy, he realised. A borrowed hero.
They thought little enough of heroes for this to be a boost to one's
own self-belief.</p>
<p>
Come with us, do these things, that you would like to do anyway,
except more so, and we will give you what you could never really have
anywhere or anytime else; real proof that you are doing the right
thing; that not only are you having immense <I>fun</I>, it is also
for the common good. So enjoy.</p>
<p>
And he <I>did</I>, and he enjoyed, though he was not always sure it
was for the right reasons. But that did not matter to them.</p>
<p>
The Chosen to the Palace.</p>
<p>
He stood back from his life and was not ashamed. All he'd ever done
was because there was something to be done. You used those weapons,
whatever they might happen to be. Given a goal, or having thought up
a goal, you had to aim for it, no matter what stood in your way. Even
the Culture recognised that. They couched it in terms of what could
be done at a specific time and level of technological capability, but
they recognised that all was relative, everything was in flux...</p>
<p>
He tried, all of a sudden - hoping to take it by surprise - to sweep
and crash back down to that place with the war-shelled mansion and
the burned-out summerhouse and the foundering boat made of stone...
but the memory would not bear the weight of it, and he was flung out
again, swirled away, cast into the nothingness, consigned to the
oblivion of the deliberately not-thought thoughts.</p>
<p>
The tent stood at the focus of the desert trails. White without,
black within, it seemed to image his crossroad imaginings.</p>
<p>
Hey hey hey. It's only a dream.</p>
<p>
Except it wasn't a dream, and he was in complete control, and if he
opened his eyes he could see the girl sitting there in front of him,
staring at him, wondering, and there was never any doubt about who
was where and what was when, and in a way that was the worst thing
about this drug; that it let you go anywhere, anytime - as not a few
drugs did - but it still let you connect back to reality whenever you
really wanted to.</p>
<p>
Cruel, he thought.</p>
<p>
The Culture might just have it right after all; being able to call up
almost any drug or combinations of drugs seemed suddenly less
indulgent and decadent than he'd imagined, before.</p>
<p>
The girl, he saw, in one awful instant, would do great things. She
would be famous and important, and the tribe around her would do
great - and terrible - things, and it would all be for nothing,
because whatever terrible train of events he had set in motion by
taking the Chosen to the Palace, this tribe would not survive; they
were the dead. Their mark upon the desert of life was already being
obscured, sands blowing over, grain by grain by grain... He had
already helped to scuff it out, no matter that they hadn't realised
this yet. They would, after he was gone. The Culture would take him
away from here, and put him down somewhere else, and this adventure
would collapse with the rest into meaninglessness, and nothing very
much would be left, as he went on to do roughly the same thing
somewhere else.</p>
<p>
Actually, he could happily have killed the Chosen, because the boy
was a fool, and he had seldom been in the company of anybody quite so
stupid. The youth was a cretin, and didn't even realise that he was.</p>
<p>
He could think of no more disastrous combination.</p>
<p>
He swept back towards the planet he had once abandoned.</p>
<p>
Came in so far, was forced away. He tried again, but without any real
self-belief.</p>
<p>
Was rejected. Well, he'd expected no more.</p>
<p>
The Chairmaker was not the person who made the chair, he thought,
immediately lucid. It was and was not him. There are no Gods, we are
told, so I must make my own salvation.</p>
<p>
His eyes were already closed, but he closed them again.</p>
<p>
He swayed in a circle, unknowing.</p>
<p>
Lies; he wept and screamed, fell at the scornful feet of the girl.</p>
<p>
Lies; he circled on.</p>
<p>
Lies; he fell to the girl, hands out, grasping for a mother that was
not there.</p>
<p>
Lies.</p>
<p>
Lies.</p>
<p>
Lies; he circled on, tracing his own private symbol in the air
between the crown of his head and the day-bright hole that was the
tent's smoke-hole.</p>
<p>
He sank towards the planet again, but the girl in the black/white
tent reached out and wiped his brow and, in that tiny movement,
seemed to wipe his being away...</p>
<p>
(Lies.)</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
... It was a long time later he found out he'd only taken the Chosen
to the Palace because the brat was to be the last of the line. Not
merely stupid, but also impotent, the Chosen fathered no strong sons
and no cunning daughters (as the Culture had known all along), and
the fractious desert tribes swept in a decade later led by a
Matriarch who had guided most of the warriors under her command
through the dream-leaf time, and had seen one stronger and stranger
than all of them suffer its effects and come through unscathed but
still unfulfilled, and known through that very experience that there
was more to their desert existence than had been guessed at by the
myths and elders of her nomad tribe.</p>

<p>
He loved the plasma rifle. He was an artist with it; he could paint
pictures of destruction, compose symphonies of demolition, write
elegies of annihilation, using that weapon.</p>
<p>
He stood, thinking about it, while the wind moved dead leaves round
his feet and the ancient stones faced into the wind.</p>
<p>
They hadn't made it off the planet. The capsule had been attacked
by... something. He couldn't tell from the damage whether it had been
a beam weapon or some sort of warhead going off nearby. Whatever it
had been, it had disabled them. Clamped to the outside of the
capsule, he'd been lucky to be on the side that shielded him from
whatever had hit it. Had he been on the other side, facing the beam
or the warhead, he'd be dead.</p>
<p>
They must have been hit by some crude effector weapon as well,
because the plasma rifle seemed to have fused. It had been cradled
between his suit and the capsule skin and couldn't have been affected
by whatever wrecked the capsule itself, but the weapon had smoked and
got hot, and when they'd finally landed - Beychae shaken but unhurt -
and opened up the gun's inspection panels, it was to find a melted,
still-warm mess inside.</p>
<p>
Maybe if he'd taken just a little less time to convince Beychae;
maybe if he'd just knocked the old guy out and left the talking for
later. He'd taken too much time, given them too much time. Seconds
counted. Dammit, milliseconds, nanoseconds counted. Too much time.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'They're going to kill you!' he'd shouted. 'They want you on their
side or they want you dead. The war's going to start soon, Tsoldrin;
you support them or you'll have an accident. They won't <I>let</I>
you stay neutral!'</p>
<p>
'Insane,' Beychae repeated, cradling Ubrel Shiol's head in his hands.
Saliva trickled from the woman's mouth. 'You're insane, Zakalwe;
insane.' He started to cry.</p>
<p>
He went over to the old man, knelt on one knee, holding the gun he'd
taken from Shiol. 'Tsoldrin; what do you think she had this for?' He
put his hand on the old man's shoulder. 'Didn't you see the way she
moved when she tried to kick me? Tsoldrin; librarians... research
assistants... they just don't move like that.' He reached out and
patted the unconscious woman's collar flat and tidy again. 'She was
one of your jailers, Tsoldrin; she would probably have been you
executioner.' He reached under the car, pulled out the bouquet of
flowers, and placed them gently under her blonde head, removing
Beychae's hands.</p>
<p>
'Tsoldrin,' he said. 'We have to go. She'll be all right.' He
arranged Shiol's arms in a less awkward position. She was already on
her side, so she wouldn't choke. He reached carefully under
Beychae's arms and slowly drew the old man up to his feet. Ubrel
Shiol's eyes flickered open; she saw the two men in front of her; she
muttered something, and one hand went to the back of her neck. She
started to roll over, unbalanced in her grogginess; the hand that had
gone to her neck came away clutching a tiny cylinder like a pen; he
felt Beychae stiffen as the girl looked up and, as she fell forward,
tried to point the little laser at Beychae's head.</p>
<p>
Beychae looked into her dark, half-unfocused eyes, over the top of
the pen laser, and felt a sort of appalled disconnectedness. The girl
tried hard to steady herself, aiming at him. Not Zakalwe, he thought;
at <I>me</I>. Me!</p>
<p>
'Ubrel...' he began.</p>
<p>
The girl fell back in a dead faint.</p>
<p>
Beychae stared down at her body lying limp on the road. Then he heard
somebody saying his name and tugging his arm.</p>
<p>
'Tsoldrin... Tsoldrin... Come on, Tsoldrin.'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe; she was aiming at <I>me</I>, not you!'</p>
<p>
'I know, Tsoldrin.'</p>
<p>
'She was aiming at me!'</p>
<p>
'I know. Come on; here's the capsule.'</p>
<p>
'At me...'</p>
<p>
'I know, I know. Get in here.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He watched the grey clouds move overhead. He stood on the flat stone
summit of a high hill, surrounded by other hilltops almost as high,
all wooded. He looked resentfully around the forested slopes and the
curious, truncated stone pillars and plinths that covered the
platform peak. He felt a sense of vertigo, exposed to such wide
horizons again after so long spent in the cleft city. He left the
view, kicked his way through some wind-piled leaves, back to where
Beychae sat and the plasma rifle rested against a great round stone.
The capsule was a hundred metres away, down in the trees.</p>
<p>
He picked up the plasma rifle for the fifth or sixth time and
inspected it.</p>
<p>
It made him want to cry; it was such a beautiful weapon. Every time
he picked it up he half hoped that it would be all right, that the
Culture had fitted it with some self-repair facility without telling
him, that the damage would be no more...</p>
<p>
The wind blew; the leaves scattered. He shook his head, exasperated.
Beychae, sitting in his thickly padded trousers and long jacket,
turned to look at him.</p>
<p>
'Broken?' the old man asked.</p>
<p>
'Broken,' he said. His face took on an expression of annoyance; he
gripped the weapon round the muzzle with both hands and swung it
round his head, then let it go and sent it whirling away into the
trees below; it disappeared in a flurry of dislodged leaves.</p>
<p>
He sat down beside Beychae.</p>
<p>
Plasma rifle gone, just a pistol left; only one suit; probably no way
he could use the suit's AG without giving away their position;
capsule wrecked; module nowhere to be seen; no word from the terminal
earring or the suit itself... it was a sorry mess. He checked the
suit for whatever broadcast signals it was picking up; the wrist
screen displayed some news headlines programme; nothing about
Solotol was mentioned. A few of the Cluster's brush-fire wars were.</p>
<p>
Beychae looked at the small screen too. 'Can you tell from that
whether they are looking for us?' he asked.</p>
<p>
'Only if we see it on the news. Military stuff will be tight-beamed;
slim chance we'll pick up a transmission.' He looked at the clouds.
'We'll probably find out more directly, soon enough.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm,' Beychae said. He frowned at the flagstones, then said, 'I
think I might know where this place is, Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah?' he said, unenthusiastically. He put his elbows on his knees,
his chin in his hands, and looked out over the wooded plains to the
low hills on the horizon.</p>
<p>
Beychae nodded. 'I've been thinking about it. I believe this is the
Srometren Observatory, in Deshal Forest.'</p>
<p>
'How far is that from Solotol?'</p>
<p>
'Oh; different continent. Good two thousand kilometres.'</p>
<p>
'Same latitude,' he said glumly, looking up at the chill grey skies.</p>
<p>
'Approximately, if this is the place I think it is.'</p>
<p>
'Who's in charge here?' he asked. 'Whose jurisdiction? Same lot as in
Solotol; the Humanists?'</p>
<p>
'The same.' Beychae said, and got up, brushing the seat of his pants
and looking around the flattened hill-top at the curious stone
instruments that covered its flagstones. 'Srometren Observatory!' he
said. 'How ironic we should happen to come down here, on our way to
the stars!'</p>
<p>
'Probably not just chance,' he said, picking up a twig and brushing a
few random shapes in the dust at his feet. 'This place famous?'</p>
<p>
'Of course,' Beychae said. 'It was the centre of astronomical
research for the old Vrehid Empire for five hundred years.'</p>
<p>
'On any tourist routes?'</p>
<p>
'Certainly.'</p>
<p>
'Then it probably has a beacon nearby, to guide aircraft in. Capsule
may have made for it when it knew it was crippled. Makes us easier to
find.' He gazed up at the sky. 'For everybody, unfortunately.' He
shook his head, went back to scratching in the dust with the twig.</p>
<p>
'What happens now?' Beychae said.</p>
<p>
He shrugged. 'We wait and see who turns up. I can't get any of the
communication gear to work, so we don't know if the Culture knows all
that's happened or not... for all I know the Module's still coming
for us, or a whole Culture starship's on its way, or - probably more
likely - your pals from Solotol...' He shrugged, threw down the twig
and sat back against the stonework behind him, glancing skyward. They
might be watching us right now.'</p>
<p>
Beychae looked up too. 'Through the clouds?'</p>
<p>
'Through the clouds.'</p>
<p>
'Shouldn't you be hiding, then? Running off through the woods?'</p>
<p>
'Maybe,' he said.</p>
<p>
Beychae stood looking down at the other man. 'Where were you thinking
of taking me, if we'd got away?'</p>
<p>
'The Impren System. There are space Habitats there,' he said.
'They're neutral, or at least not as pro-war as this place.'</p>
<p>
'Do your... superiors really think war is so close, Zakalwe?'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' he sighed. He already had the suit's face-plate hinged up;
now, with another look at the sky, he took the whole helmet off. He
put one hand up over his forehead and through his drawn-back hair,
then reached back and took the pony-tail out of its little ring,
shaking his long black hair down. 'It might take ten days, might take
a hundred, but it's coming.' He smiled thinly at Beychae. 'For the
same reasons as last time.'</p>
<p>
'I thought we'd won the ecological argument against terra-forming,'
said Beychae.</p>
<p>
'We did, but times change; people change, generations change. We won
the battles for the acknowledgement of machine sentience, but by all
accounts the issue was fudged after that. Now people are saying, yes,
they're sentient, but it's only human sentience that <I>counts.</I>
Plus, people never need too much of an excuse to see other species as
inferior.'</p>
<p>
Beychae was silent for a while, then said, 'Zakalwe, has it ever
occurred to you that in all these things the Culture may not be as
disinterested as you imagine, and it claims?'</p>
<p>
'No, it never occurred to me,' he said, though Beychae got the
impression the man hadn't really thought first before answering.</p>
<p>
'They want other people to be like them, Cheradenine. They don't
terraform, so they don't want others to either. There are arguments
for it as well, you know; increasing species diversity often seems
more important to people than preserving a wilderness, even without
the provision of extra living space. The Culture believes profoundly
in machine sentience, so it thinks everybody ought to, but I think it
also believes every civilisation should be run by its machines.
Fewer people want that. The issue of cross-species tolerance is, I'll
grant, of a different nature, but even there the Culture can
sometimes appear to be insistent that deliberate inter-mixing is not
just permissible but desirable; almost a duty. Again, who is to say
that is correct?'</p>
<p>
'So you should have a war to... what? Clear the air?' He inspected
the suit helmet.</p>
<p>
'No, Cheradenine, I'm just trying to suggest to you that the Culture
may not be as objective as it thinks it is, and, that being the case,
its estimation concerning the likelihood of war may be equally
untrustworthy.'</p>
<p>
'There are small wars on a dozen planets right now, Tsoldrin. People
are talking war in public; either about how to avoid it, or how it
might be limited, or how it can't possibly happen... but it's coming;
you can smell it. You should catch the newscasts, Tsoldrin. Then
you'd know.'</p>
<p>
'Well then, perhaps war is inevitable,' Beychae said, looking away
over the wooded plains and hills beyond the observatory. 'Maybe it's
just... time.'</p>
<p>
'Crap,' he said. Beychae looked at him, surprised. 'There's a saying:
&quot;War is a long cliff.&quot; You can avoid the cliff completely,
you can walk along the top for as long as you have the nerve, you can
even choose to leap off, and if you only fall a short way before you
hit a ledge you can always scramble back up again. Unless you're just
plain invaded, there are always choices, and even then, there's
usually something you've missed - a choice you didn't make - that
could have avoided invasion in the first place. You people still have
your choices. There's nothing inevitable about it.'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe,' Beychae said. 'You surprise me. I'd have thought you -'</p>
<p>
'You'd have thought I'd be in favour of war?' he said, standing, a
sad small smile on his lips. He put one hand on the other man's
shoulder. 'You've had your nose buried in books for too long,
Tsoldrin.' He walked away past the stone instruments. Beychae looked
down at the suit helmet, lying on the flagstones. He followed the
other man.</p>
<p>
'You're right, Zakalwe. I have been out of the flow of things for a
long time. I probably don't know who half the people in power are
these days, or exactly what the issues are, or the precise balance of
the various alliances... so the Culture cannot be so... desperate
they think I can alter whatever's going to happen. Can they?'</p>
<p>
He turned round. He looked into Beychae's face. 'Tsoldrin, the truth
is I don't know. Don't think I haven't thought about this. It might
be just that you, as a symbol, really,.would make all the difference,
and maybe everybody is desperate to find an excuse not to have to
fight; you could be that excuse if you come along, uncontaminated by
recent events, as though from the dead, and provide a face-saving
compromise.</p>
<p>
'Or maybe the Culture secretly thinks a small short war is a good
idea, or even knows there's nothing it can do to stop a full-scale
one, but has to be seen to be doing something, no matter how long a
shot it might be, so that people can't say later &quot;Why didn't you
try <I>this</I>?&quot;' He shrugged. 'I never try to second-guess the
Culture, Tsoldrin, let alone Contact, and certainly not Special
Circumstances.'</p>
<p>
'You just do their bidding.'</p>
<p>
'And get well paid for it.'</p>
<p>
'But you see yourself on the side of good, do you, Cheradenine?'</p>
<p>
He smiled and sat on the stone plinth, legs swinging. 'I have no idea
whether they're the good guys or not, Tsoldrin. They certainly <I>seem</I>
to be, but then who knows that seeming is being?' He frowned, looked
away. 'I have never seen them be cruel, even when they might have
claimed they had an excuse to be so. It can make them seem cold,
sometimes.' He shrugged again. 'But there are folks that'll tell you
it's the bad gods that always have the most beautiful faces and the
softest voices. Shit,' he said, and jumped off the stone table. He
went to stand by the balustrade which marked one edge of the old
observatory, looking to where the sky was starting to redden above
the horizon. It would be dark in an hour. 'They keep their promises
and they pay top rates. They make good employers, Tsoldrin.'</p>
<p>
'That does not mean we ought to let them decide our fate.'</p>
<p>
'You'd rather let those decadent dickheads in Governance do it
instead?'</p>
<p>
'At least they're <I>involved</I>, Zakalwe; it isn't just a game to
them.'</p>
<p>
'Oh, I think it is. I think that's exactly what it is to them. The
difference is that unlike the Culture's Minds, they don't know enough
to take games seriously.' He took a deep breath and watched the wind
stir the branches beneath them; leaves fell away. 'Tsoldrin; don't
say you're on their side.'</p>
<p>
'The sides were always strange,' Beychae said. 'We all said that all
we wanted was the best for the Cluster, and I think we all meant it,
mostly. We all still want that. But I don't know what the right thing
to do is; I sometimes think I know too much, I've studied too much,
learned too much, remembered too much. It all seems to average out,
somehow; like dust that settles over... whatever machinery we carry
inside us that leads us to act, and puts the same weight everywhere,
so that always you can see good and bad on each side, and always
there are arguments, precedents for every possible course of
action... so of course one ends up doing nothing. Perhaps that's only
right; perhaps that's what evolution requires, to leave the field
free for younger, unencumbered minds, and those not afraid to act.'</p>
<p>
'Okay, so it's a balance. All societies are like that; the damping
hand of the old and the firebrand youth together. It works out
through generations, or through the set-up of your institutions, and
their change and even replacement; but Governance, the Humanists,
combine the worst of both approaches. Ancient, vicious, discredited
ideas backed with adolescent war-mania. It's a crock of shit,
Tsoldrin, and you know it. You've earned the right to some leisure;
nobody's arguing. But that won't stop you feeling guilty when - not
if - the bad stuff comes. You have the power, Tsoldrin, whether you
like it or not; just doing nothing is a statement, don't you
understand that? What is all your studying worth, all your learning,
all your knowledge, if it doesn't lead to wisdom? And what's wisdom
but knowing what is right, and what is the right thing to do? You're
almost a god to some of the people in this civilisation, Tsoldrin;
again, whether you like it or not. If you do nothing... they'll feel
abandoned. They'll feel despair. And who can blame them?'</p>
<p>
He made a resigned sort of gesture with his hands, putting them both
down on the stone parapet, gazing out to the darkening sky. Beychae
was silent.</p>
<p>
He gave the old man a while longer to think, then looked round at the
flat stone summit of the hill, at all the strange stone instruments.
'An observatory, eh?'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' Beychae said after a moment's hesitation. He touched one of
the stone plinths with one hand. 'Believed to have been a burial
site, four or five thousand years ago; then to have had some sort of
astrological significance; later, they may have predicted eclipses
with readings taken here. Finally, the Vrehids built this observatory
to study the motions of the moons, planets and stars. There are
water-clocks, sundials, sextants, planet-dials... partial orreries...
there are crude seismographs here, too, or at least earthquake
direction indicators.'</p>
<p>
'They have telescopes?'</p>
<p>
'Very poor ones, and only for a decade or so before the Empire fell.
The results they got from the telescopes caused a lot of problems;
contradicted what they already knew, or thought they knew.'</p>
<p>
'That figures. What's this?' One of the plinths held a large, rusty
metal bowl with a sharp central spindle.</p>
<p>
'Compass, I think,' Beychae said. 'It works by fields,' he smiled.</p>
<p>
'And this? Looks like a tree stump.' It was a huge, rough, very
slightly fluted cylinder perhaps a metre in height, and twice that
across. He tapped the edge. 'Hmm; stone.'</p>
<p>
'Ah!' Tsoldrin said, joining him at the stone cylinder. 'Well, if
it's what I think it is... it was originally just a tree stump, of
course...' He ran his hand over the stone surface, looked round the
edge for something. 'But it was petrified, long ago. Look though; you
can still see the rings in the wood.'</p>
<p>
He leant closer, looking at the grey stone surface by the fading
afternoon light. The growth rings of the long dead tree were indeed
visible. He leant forward, taking off one of the suit gloves, and
with his fingers stroked the surface of the stone. Some differential
weathering of the wood-become-rock had made the rings tangible; his
fingers felt the tiny ridges run beneath their surface like the
fingerprint of some mighty stone god.</p>
<p>
'So many years,' he breathed, putting his hand back to the very
sapling centre of the stump, and running his hand out again. Beychae
said nothing.</p>
<p>
Every year a complete ring, signature of bad year and good by the
spacing, and every ring complete, sealed, hermetic. Every year like
part of a sentence, every ring a shackle, chained and chaining to the
past; every ring a wall, a prison. A sentence locked in the wood, now
locked in stone, frozen twice, sentenced twice, once for an
imaginable time, then for an unimaginable time. His finger ran over
the ring walls, dry paper over ridged rock.</p>
<p>
'This is just the cover,' Beychae said from the other side. He was
squatting down, looking for something on the side of the great stone
stump. 'There ought to be... ah. Here we are. Don't expect we'll be
able to actually lift it, of course...'</p>
<p>
'Cover?' he said, putting the glove back on and walking round to
where Beychae was. 'Cover for what?'</p>
<p>
'A sort of <I>puzzle</I> the Imperial Astronomers played when the
viewing was patchy,' Beychae said. 'There; see that handhold?'</p>
<p>
'Just a second,' he said. 'Want to stand back a little?' Beychae
stood back. 'It's supposed to take four strong men, Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
'This suit's more powerful than that, though balancing might be a
little...' He found two hand-holds on the stone. 'Suit command;
strength normal max.'</p>
<p>
'You have to talk to the suit?' Beychae asked.</p>
<p>
'Yeah,' he said. He flexed, lifting one edge of the stone cover up; a
tiny explosion of dust under the sole of one of the suit's boots
announced a trapped pebble giving up the struggle. 'This one you do;
they have ones you just have to think about something, but...' he
pulled on one edge of the cover, sticking one leg out to shift his
centre of gravity as he did so. '... but I just never liked the idea
of that.' He held the whole stone top of the petrified stump above
his head, then walked awkwardly, to the noise of crunching, popping
gravel under his feet, to another stone table; he lowered, shifted
the stone cover sidways until it rested on the table, and returned;
he made the mistake of clapping his hands together, and produced what
sounded like a gunshot. 'Oops,' he grinned. 'Suit command; strength
off.'</p>
<p>
Revealed by the removal of the stone cap was a shallow cone. It
seemed to have been carved from the petrified stump itself. Looking
closer, he could see that it was ridged, tree ring by tree ring.</p>
<p>
'Quite clever,' he said, mildly disappointed.</p>
<p>
'You're not looking at it properly, Cheradenine,' Beychae told him.
'Look closer.'</p>
<p>
He looked closer.</p>
<p>
'I don't suppose you have anything very small and spherical, do you?'
Beychae said, 'Like a... ball-bearing.'</p>
<p>
'A ball-bearing?' he said, a pained expression on his face.</p>
<p>
'You don't have such things?'</p>
<p>
'I think you'll find in most societies ball-bearings don't last much
beyond room-temperature superconductivity, let alone field
technology. Unless you're into industrial archeology and trying to
keep some ancient machine running. No, I don't have any ball...' he
peered closer at the centre of the shallow rock cone. 'Notches.'</p>
<p>
'Exactly.' Beychae smiled.</p>
<p>
He stood back, looking at the ridged cone as a whole. 'It's a maze!'</p>
<p>
Maze. There had been a maze in the garden. They outgrew it, became
too familiar with it, eventually only used it when other children
they didn't like came for the day to the great house; they could lose
them in the maze for a few hours.</p>
<p>
'Yes,' Beychae nodded. 'They would start out with small coloured
beads or pebbles, and try to work their way to the rim.' He looked
closer. 'They say there might have been a way to turn it into a game,
by painting lines that divided each ring into segments; little wooden
bridges and blocking pieces like walls could be used to facilitate
one's own progress or prevent that of one's rivals.' Beychae squinted
closer in the fading light. 'Hmm. Paint must have faded.'</p>
<p>
He looked down at the hundreds of tiny ridges on the surface of the
shallow cone - like a model of a huge volcano, he thought - and
smiled. He sighed, looked at the screen set into the wrist of the
suit, tried the emergency signal button again. No reply.</p>
<p>
'Trying to contact the Culture?'</p>
<p>
'Mmm,' he said, gazing again at the petrified maze.</p>
<p>
'What will happen to you if Governance find us?' Beychae asked.</p>
<p>
'Oh,' he shrugged, walking back to the balustrade they had stood at
earlier. 'Probably not much. Not very likely they'll just blow my
brains out; they'll want to question me. Should give the Culture
plenty of time to get me out; either negotiated or just snapped away.
Don't worry about me.' He smiled at Beychae. 'Tell them I took you by
force. I'll say I stunned you and stuffed you into the capsule. So
don't worry; they'll probably let you go straight back to your
studies.'</p>
<p>
'Well,' Beychae said, rejoining the other man at the balustrade. 'My
studies were a delicate construction, Zakalwe; they maintained my
carefully developed disinterest. They may not be so easy to resume,
after your... exuberantly violent interruption.'</p>
<p>
'Ah.' He tried not to smile. He looked down at the trees, then at the
suit gloves, as though checking all the fingers were there. 'Yeah.
Look, Tsoldrin... I'm sorry... I mean about your friend, Ms Shiol.'</p>
<p>
'As am I,' Beychae said quietly. He smiled uncertainly. 'I felt
happy, Cheradenine. I hadn't felt like that for... well, long
enough.' They stood watching the sun sink behind the clouds. 'You are
certain she was one of theirs? I mean, absolutely?'</p>
<p>
'Beyond any reasonable doubt, Tsoldrin.' He thought he saw tears in
the old man's eyes. He looked away. 'Like I said; I'm sorry.'</p>
<p>
'I hope,' Beychae said, 'that is not the only way the old can be made
happy... can be happy. Through deceit.'</p>
<p>
'Maybe it wasn't all deceit,' he said. 'And anyway, being old isn't
what it used to be; I'm <I>old</I>,' he reminded Beychae, who nodded,
took out a kerchief and sniffed.</p>
<p>
'Of course; so you are. I forgot. Strange, isn't it? Whenever we see
people after a long time we are always surprised how they've grown or
aged. But when I see you, well, you haven't changed a bit, and
instead I feel very old - unfairly, unjustifiably old - beside you,
Cheradenine.'</p>
<p>
'Actually I have changed, Tsoldrin.' He grinned. 'But no, I haven't
got any older.' He looked Beychae in the eye. 'They'd give you this,
too, if you asked them. The Culture would let you grow younger, then
stabilise your age, or let you grow old again, but very slowly.'</p>
<p>
'Bribery, Zakalwe?' Beychae said, smiling.</p>
<p>
'Hey, it was just a thought. And it'd be a payment, not a bribe. And
they wouldn't force it on you. But it's academic, anyway.' He paused,
nodding into the sky. 'Completely academic; now. Here comes a
plane.'</p>
<p>
Tsoldrin looked out to the red clouds of sunset. He couldn't see any
aircraft.</p>
<p>
'A Culture one?' Beychae asked cautiously.</p>
<p>
He smiled. 'In the circumstances, Tsoldrin, if you can see it, it
isn't a Culture one.' He turned and walked quickly, picking up the
suit helmet and putting it on. Suddenly the dark figure became
inhuman, behind the armoured, sensor-studded faceplate of the suit.
He took a large pistol from the suit holster.</p>
<p>
'Tsoldrin,' his voice came booming from speakers set in the suit
chest as he checked the settings on the gun. 'If I were you I'd get
back to the capsule, or just plain run away and hide.' The figure
turned to face Beychae, the helmet like the head of some gigantic,
fearsome insect. 'I'm fixing to give these assholes a fight, just for
the sheer hell of it, and it might be best for you if you weren't
nearby.'</p>

<p>
The ship was over eighty kilometres long and it was called the <I>Size
Isn't Everything.</I> The last thing he'd been on for any length of
time had actually been bigger, but then that had been a tabular
iceberg big enough to hide two armies on, and it didn't beat the
General Systems Vehicle by much.</p>
<p>
'How do these things hold <I>together</I>?' He stood on a balcony,
looking out over a sort of miniature valley composed of
accommodation units; each stepped terrace was smothered in foliage,
the space was criss-crossed by walk-ways and slender bridges, and a
small stream ran through the bottom of the V. People sat at tables in
little courtyards, lounged on the grass by the stream side or amongst
the cushions and couches of cafes and bars on the terraces. Hanging
above the centre of the valley, beneath a ceiling of glowing blue, a
travel-tube snaked away into the distance on either side, following
the wavy line of the valley. Under the tube, a line of fake sunlight
burned, like some enormous strip light.</p>
<p>
'Hmm?' Diziet Sma said, arriving at his elbow with two drinks; she
handed one to him.</p>
<p>
'They're too big,' he said. He turned to face the woman. He'd seen
the things they called <I>bays</I>, where they built smaller space
ships (smaller in this case meant over three kilometres long); vast
unsupported hangars with thin walls. He'd been near the immense
engines, which as far as he could gather were solid, and inaccessible
(how?), and obviously extremely massive; he'd felt oddly threatened
on discovering that there was no control room, no bridge, no flight
deck anywhere in the vast vessel, just three Minds - fancy computers,
apparently - controlling everything (what!?)</p>
<p>
And now he was finding out where the people lived, but it was all too
big, too much, too flimsy somehow, especially if the ship was
supposed to accelerate as smartly as Sma claimed. He shook his head.
'I don't understand; how does it hold together?'</p>
<p>
Sma smiled. 'Just think; fields, Cheradenine. It's all done with
force fields.' She put one hand out to his troubled face, patted one
cheek. 'Don't look so confused. And don't try to understand it all
too quickly. Let it soak in. Just wander around; lose yourself in it
for a few days. Come back whenever.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Later, he had wandered off. The huge ship was an enchanted ocean in
which you could never drown, and he threw himself into it to try to
understand if not it, then the people who had built it.</p>
<p>
He walked for days, stopping at bars and restaurants whenever he felt
thirsty, hungry or tired; mostly they were automatic and he was
served by little floating trays, though a few were staffed by real
people. They seemed less like servants and more like customers who'd
taken a notion to help out for a while.</p>
<p>
'Of course I don't have to do this,' one middle-aged man said,
carefully cleaning the table with a damp cloth. He put the cloth in a
little pouch, sat down beside him. 'But look; this table's clean.'</p>
<p>
He agreed that the table was clean.</p>
<p>
'Usually,' the man said. 'I work on alien - no offence - alien
religions; Directional Emphasis In Religious Observance; that's my
speciality... like when temples or graves or prayers always have to
face in a certain direction; that sort of thing? Well, I catalogue,
evaluate, compare; I come up with theories and argue with colleagues,
here and elsewhere. But... the job's never finished; always new
examples, and even the old ones get re-evaluated, and new people come
along with new ideas about what you thought was settled... but,' he
slapped the table, 'when you clean a table you clean a table. You
feel you've done something. It's an achievement.'</p>
<p>
'But in the end, it's still just cleaning a table.'</p>
<p>
'And therefore does not really signify on the cosmic scale of
events?' the man suggested.</p>
<p>
He smiled in response to the man's grin, 'Well, yes.'</p>
<p>
'But then, what <I>does</I> signify? My other work? Is that really
important, either? I could try composing wonderful musical works, or
day-long entertainment epics, but what would that do? Give people
pleasure? My wiping this table gives me pleasure. And people come to
a clean table, which gives <I>them </I>pleasure. And anyway,' the man
laughed, 'people die; stars die; universes die. What is any
achievement, however great it was, once time itself is dead? Of
course, if <I>all</I> I did was wipe tables, then of course it would
seem a mean and despicable waste of my huge intellectual potential.
But because I choose to do it, it gives me pleasure. And,' the man
said with a smile, 'it's a good way of meeting people. So; where are
you from, anyway?'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He talked to people all the time; in bars and cafes, mostly. The
GSV's accommodation seemed to be divided into various different types
of lay-out; valleys (or ziggurats, if you wanted to look at them like
that) seemed to be the most common, though there were different
configurations.</p>
<p>
He ate when he was hungry and drank when he was thirsty, every time
trying a different dish or drink from the stunningly complicated
menus, and when he wanted to sleep - as the whole vessel gradually
cycled into a red-tinged dusk, the ceiling light-bars dimming - he
just asked a drone, and was directed to the nearest unoccupied room.
The rooms were all roughly the same size, and yet all slightly
different; some were very plain, some were highly decorated. The
basics were always there; bed - sometimes a real, physical bed,
sometimes one of their weird field-beds - somewhere to wash and
defaecate, cupboards, places for personal effects, a fake window, a
holo screen of some sort, and a link up to the rest of the
communications net, both aboard and off-ship. The first night away,
he linked into one of their direct-link sensory entertainments, lying
on the bed with some sort of device activated under the pillow.</p>
<p>
He did not actually sleep that night; instead he was a bold pirate
prince who'd renounced his nobility to lead a brave crew against the
slaver ships of a terrible empire amongst the spice and treasure
isles; their quick little ships darted amongst the lumbering
galleons, picking away the rigging with chain shot. They came ashore
on moonless nights, attacking the great prison castles, releasing
joyous captives; he personally fought the wicked governor's chief
torturer, sword against sword; the man finally fell from a high
tower. An alliance with a beautiful lady pirate begot a more personal
liaison, and a daring rescue from a mountain monastery when she was
captured...</p>
<p>
He pulled away from it, after what had been weeks of compressed time.
He knew (somewhere at the back of his mind) even as it happened that
none of it was real, but that seemed like the least important
property of the adventure. When he came out of it - surprised to
discover that he had not actually ejaculated during some of the
profoundly convincing erotic episodes - he discovered that only a
night had passed, and it was morning, and he had, somehow, shared the
strange story with others; it had been a game, apparently. People had
left messages for him to get in touch, they had enjoyed playing the
game with him so much. He felt oddly ashamed, and did not reply.</p>
<p>
The rooms he slept in always contained places to sit; field
extensions, mouldable wall units, real couches, and - sometimes -
ordinary chairs. Whenever the rooms held chairs, he moved them
outside, into the corridor or onto the terrace.</p>
<p>
It was all he could do to keep the memories at bay.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Na,' the woman said in the Mainbay. 'It doesn't really work that
way.' They stood on a half-constructed starship, on what would
eventually be the middle of the engines, watching a huge field-unit
swing through the air, out of the engineering space behind the bay
proper and up towards the skeletal body of the General Contact Unit.
Little lifter tugs manoeuvred the field unit down towards them.</p>
<p>
'You mean it makes no difference?'</p>
<p>
'Not much,' the woman said. She pressed on a little studded lanyard
she held in one hand, spoke as though to her shoulder. 'I'll take
it.' The field-unit put them in shadow as it hovered above them. Just
another solid slab, as far as he could see. It was red; a different
colour from the black slickness of the starboard Main Engine Block
Lower under their feet. She manipulated the lanyard, guiding the huge
red block down; two other people standing twenty metres away watched
the far end of the unit.</p>
<p>
'The trouble is,' the woman said, watching the vast red
building-brick come slowly down, 'that even when people do get sick
and die young, they're always surprised when they get sick. How many
healthy people do you think actually say to themselves, &quot;Hey,
I'm healthy today!&quot;, unless they've just had a serious illness?'
She shrugged, pressed the lanyard again as the field-unit lowered to
a couple of centimetres off the engine surface. 'Stop,' she said
quietly. 'Inertia down five. Check.' A line of light flashed on the
surface of the engine block. She put one hand on the block, and
pressed it again. It moved. 'Down dead slow,' she said. She pressed
the block into place. 'Sorzh; all right?' she asked. He didn't hear
the reply, but the woman obviously did.</p>
<p>
'Okay; positioned; all clear.' She looked up as the lifter tugs
sailed back towards the engineering space, then back at him. 'All
that's happened is that reality has caught up with the way people
always did behave anyway. So, no, you don't feel any wonderful
release from debilitating illnesses.' She scratched one ear. 'Except
maybe when you think about it.' She grinned. 'I guess in school, when
you're seeing how people used to live... how aliens still do live...
then it hits home, and I suppose you never really lose that entirely,
but you don't spend much time thinking about it.'</p>
<p>
They walked across the black expanse of thoroughly featureless
material ('Ah,' the woman had said, when he'd mentioned this, 'you
take a look at it under a microscope; it's beautiful! What did you
expect, anyway? Cranks? Gears? Tanks full of chemicals?')</p>
<p>
'Can't machines build these faster?' he asked the woman, looking
around the starship shell.</p>
<p>
'Why, of course!' she laughed.</p>
<p>
'Then why do you do it?'</p>
<p>
'It's fun. You see one of these big mothers sail out those doors for
the first time, heading for deep space, three hundred people on
board, everything working, the Mind quite happy, and you think; I
helped build that. The fact a machine could have done it faster
doesn't alter the fact that it was you who actually did it.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm,' he said.</p>
<p>
(Learn woodwork; metalwork; they will not make you a carpenter or a
blacksmith any more than mastering writing will make you a clerk.)</p>
<p>
'Well, you may &quot;hmm&quot; as you wish,' the woman said,
approaching a translucent hologram of the half-completed ship, where
a few other construction workers were standing, pointing inside the
model and talking. 'But have you ever been gliding, or swum
underwater?'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' he agreed.</p>
<p>
The woman shrugged. 'Yet birds fly better than we do, and fish swim
better. Do we stop gliding or swimming because of this?'</p>
<p>
He smiled. 'I suppose not.'</p>
<p>
'You suppose correctly,' the woman said. 'And why?' she looked at
him, grinning. 'Because it's fun.' She looked at the holo model of
the ship to one side. One of the other workers called to her,
pointing at something in the model. She looked at him. 'Excuse me,
will you?'</p>
<p>
He nodded, as he backed off. 'Build well.'</p>
<p>
'Thank you. I trust we shall.'</p>
<p>
'Oh,' he asked. 'What's this ship to be called?'</p>
<p>
'Its Mind wishes it to be called the <I>Sweet and Full of Grace</I>,'
the woman laughed. Then she was deep in discussion with the others.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He watched their many sports; tried a few. Most of them he just
didn't understand. He swam quite a lot; they seemed to like pools and
water complexes. Mostly they swam naked, which he found a little
embarrassing. Later he discovered there were whole sections -
villages? areas? districts? he wasn't sure how to think of them -
where people never wore clothes, just body ornaments. He was
surprised how quickly he got used to this behaviour, but never fully
joined in.</p>
<p>
It took him a while to realise that all the drones he saw - even more
various in their design than humans were in their physiology - didn't
all belong to the ship. Hardly any did, in fact; they had their own
artificial brains (he still tended to think of them as computers).
They seemed to have their own personalities, too, though he remained
sceptical.</p>
<p>
'Let me put this thought experiment to you,' the old drone said, as
they played a card-game which it had assured him was mostly luck.
They sat - well, the drone floated - under an arcade of delicately
pink stone, by the side of a small pool; the shouts of people playing
a complicated ball-game on the far side of the pool filtered through
bushes and small trees to them.</p>
<p>
'Forget,' said the drone, 'about how machine brains are actually put
together; think about making a machine brain - an electronic computer
- in the image of a human one. One might start with a few cells, as
the human embryo does; these multiply, gradually establish
connections. So one would continually add new components and make
the relevant, even - if one was to follow the exact development of
one single human through the various stages - the <I>identical</I>
connections.</p>
<p>
'One would, of course, have to limit the speed of the messages
transmitted down those connections to a tiny fraction of their normal
electronic speed, but that would not be difficult, nor would having
these neuron-like components act like their biological equivalents
internally, firing their own messages according to the types of
signal they received; all this could be done comparatively simply. By
building up in this gradual way, you could mimic exactly the
development of a human brain, <I>and</I> you could mimic its output;
just as an embryo can experience sound and touch and even light
inside the womb, so could you send similar signals to your developing
electronic equivalent; you could impersonate the experience of birth,
and use any degree of sensory stimulation to fool this device into
thinking it was feeling touching, tasting, smelling, hearing and
seeing everything your real human was (or, of course, you might
choose not actually to fool it, but always give it just as much
genuine sensory input, and of the same quality, as the human
personality was experiencing at any given point).</p>
<p>
'Now; my question to you is this; where is the difference? The brain
of each being works in exactly the same way as the other; they will
respond to stimuli with a greater correspondence than one finds even
between monozygotic twins; but how can one still choose to call one a
conscious entity, and the other merely a machine?</p>
<p>
'Your brain is made up of matter, Mr Zakalwe, organised into
information-handling, processing and storage units by your genetic
inheritance and by the biochemistry of first your mother's body and
later your own, not to mention your experiences since some short
time before your birth until now.</p>
<p>
'An electronic computer is also made up of matter, but organised
differently; what is there so magical about the workings of the huge,
slow cells of the animal brain that they can claim themselves to be
conscious, but would deny a quicker, more finely-grained device of
equivalent power - or even a machine hobbled so that it worked with
precisely the same ponderous-ness - a similar distinction?</p>
<p>
'Hmm?' the machine said, its aura field flashing the pink he was
beginning to identify as drone amusement. 'Unless, of course, you
wish to invoke superstition? Do you believe in gods?'</p>
<p>
He smiled. 'I have never had that inclination,' he said.</p>
<p>
'Well then,' the drone said. 'What would you say? Is the machine in
the human image conscious, sentient, or not?'</p>
<p>
He studied his cards. 'I'm thinking,' he said, and laughed.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Sometimes he saw other aliens (obviously aliens, that is; he was sure
that a few of the humans he saw each day were not Culture people,
though without stopping to ask them it was impossible to tell;
somebody dressed as a savage, or in some obviously non-Culture garb,
was quite possibly just dressing up like that for a laugh, or going
to a party... but there were some very obviously different species
around as well).</p>
<p>
'Yes, young man?' the alien said. It had eight limbs, a fairly
distinct head with two quite small eyes, curiously flower-like mouth
parts, and a large, almost spherical, lightly haired body, coloured
red and purple. Its own voice was composed of clicks from its mouth
and almost subsonic vibrations from its body; a small amulet did the
translating.</p>
<p>
He asked if he could sit with the alien; it directed him to the seat
across the table from it in the cafe where he had overheard it
talking briefly to a passing human about Special Circumstances.</p>
<p>
'... It is in layers,' the alien replied to his question. 'A tiny
core of Special Circumstances, a shell of Contact, and a vast chaotic
ecosphere of everything else. Bit like a... you come from a planet?'</p>
<p>
He nodded. The creature glanced at its amulet for a translation of
the gesture the man had used - it was not what the Culture called
nodding - then said, 'Well, it is like a planet, only the core is
tiny; very tiny. And the ecosphere is more disparate and less
distinct than the wrapping of atmosphere round a globe; a red giant
star might even be a better comparison. But in the end, you will
never know them, because you will be like me, in Special
Circumstances, and only ever know them as the great, irresistible
force behind you; people like you and I are the edge; you will in
time come to feel like a tooth on the biggest saw in the galaxy,
sir.' The alien's eyes closed; it waggled all its limbs very
energetically, and its mouth parts crackled. 'Ha ha ha!' the amulet
said, primly.</p>
<p>
'How did you know I was actually involved with Special
Circumstances?' he asked, sitting back.</p>
<p>
'Ah! How much my vanity wishes me to claim I simply guessed, so
clever I am... but I heard there was a new recruit coming aboard,'
the alien told him. 'And that it was a fairly human-basic male.
You... smell right, if I may use that turn of phrase. And you... have
just been asking all the right questions.'</p>
<p>
'And you're in SC too?'</p>
<p>
'For ten standard years now.'</p>
<p>
'Think I should do it? Work for them?'</p>
<p>
'Oh yes; I imagine it's better than what you left, no?'</p>
<p>
He shrugged, remembering the blizzard and the ice. 'I suppose.'</p>
<p>
'You enjoy... fighting, yes?'</p>
<p>
'Well... sometimes,' he admitted. 'I'm good at it, so they say. Not
that I'm necessarily convinced of that myself.'</p>
<p>
'No-one wins all the time, sir,' the creature said. 'Not through
skill, anyway, and the Culture does not believe in luck, or at the
very least does not believe it is transferrable. They must like your
attitude, that's all. Hee hee.'</p>
<p>
The alien laughed quietly.</p>
<p>
'To be good at soldiering,' it said, 'is a great curse, I think
sometimes. Working for these people at least relieves one of some of
the responsibility. I have never found cause to complain.' The alien
scratched its body, looked down, picked something from the hairs
around where he would have guessed its belly might be, and ate it.
'Of course, you must not expect to be told the truth all the time.
You can insist that they do, always, and they will do so, but they
may not be able to use you as often as they might like to; sometimes
they need you not to know you are fighting on the wrong side. My
advice would be to just do as they ask; much more exciting.'</p>
<p>
'Are you in it for the excitement?'</p>
<p>
'Partly, and partly because of family honour; SC did something for
my people once, and we could not let them steal our honour by
accepting nothing in return. I work until that debt is paid off.'</p>
<p>
'How long's that?'</p>
<p>
'Oh, for life,' the creature said, sitting back in a gesture he felt
reasonably justified in translating as surprise. 'Until I die, of
course. But who cares? As I say; it's fun. Here.' It banged its
drink-bowl on the table to attract a passing tray. 'Let's have
another drink; see who gets drunk first.'</p>
<p>
'You have more legs.' He grinned. 'I think I might fall over more
easily.'</p>
<p>
'Ah, but the more the legs, the bigger the tangle.'</p>
<p>
'Fair enough.' He waited for a fresh glass.</p>
<p>
To one side of them was a small terrace and the bar, to the other a
gulf of airy space. The ship, the GSV, went on beyond its apparent
boundaries. Its hull was pierced multitudinously by terraces,
balconies, walk-ways, open windows, and open bay doors. Surrounding
the vessel proper was an immense ellipsoid bubble of air, held inside
dozens of different fields, which together made up the Vehicle's real
- though insubstantial - hull.</p>
<p>
He took up the recharged glass when it arrived, and watched a
puttering, piston-engined, paper-winged hang-glider zip past the
terrace; he waved at the pilot, then shook his head.</p>
<p>
'To the Culture,' he said, raising his glass to the alien. It matched
his gesture. 'To its total lack of respect for all things majestic.'</p>
<p>
'Agreed,' the alien said, and together they drank.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The alien was called Chori, he found out later. It was only due to a
chance remark that he discovered Chori was a female, which at the
time seemed hilariously funny.</p>
<p>
He woke up the next morning lying soaked as well as soused half
underneath a small waterfall in one of the ace section valleys; Chori
was suspended from a nearby railing by all eight leg-hooks, making a
sporadic clattering noise that he decided was snoring.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The first night he spent with a woman, he thought she was dying; he
thought he'd killed her. She seemed to climax at almost the same time
as he did, but then - apparently - had a seizure; screaming,
clutching at him. He had an awful, sickening idea that despite the
seeming similarity of their physiology, his race and the
mongrel-species that was the Culture were somehow quite different,
and for a few ghastly moments entertained the idea that his seed was
like acid inside her. It felt like she was trying to break his back
with her arms and legs. He tried to pull himself away from her,
calling her name, trying to see what was wrong, what he had done,
what he could do.</p>
<p>
'What's wrong?' she gasped.</p>
<p>
'What? With me; nothing! What's wrong with <I>you</I>?'</p>
<p>
She made a sort of shrugging motion, looked puzzled. 'I came; that's
all; what's the... Oh.' She put one hand to her mouth, eyes wide. 'I
forgot. I'm sorry. You're not... Oh dear.' She giggled. 'How
embarrassing.'</p>
<p>
'<I>What</I>?'</p>
<p>
'Well, we just... you know; it takes... it goes on... longer, you
know?'</p>
<p>
He didn't think he had quite believed what he had heard about the
Culture's altered physiology until then. He hadn't accepted that they
had changed themselves so. He had not believed that they really had
chosen to extend such moments of pleasure, let alone breed into
themselves all the multifarious drug glands that could enhance almost
any experience (not least sex).</p>
<p>
Yet - in a way - it made sense, he told himself. Their machines could
do everything else much better than they could; no sense in breeding
super-humans for strength or intelligence, when their drones and
Minds were so much more matter- and energy-efficient at both. But
pleasure... well, that was a different matter.</p>
<p>
What else was the human form good for?</p>
<p>
He supposed such single-mindedness was admirable, in a way.</p>
<p>
He took the woman in his arms again. 'Never mind,' he said. 'Quality
not quantity. Let's try that again, shall we?'</p>
<p>
She laughed and took his face in her hands. 'Dedication; that's a
good quality in a man.'</p>
<p>
(The cry in the summerhouse that had attracted; 'Hello, old chap.'
Tanned hands on the pale hips...)</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He was away five nights, just wandering. As far as he could tell, he
never crossed his own trail, and never visited the same section
twice. He ended up with different women on three of those nights, and
politely turned down one young man.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Any more at your ease, Cheradenine?' Sma asked him, stroking up the
pool ahead of him. She turned on her back to look at him. He swam
after her.</p>
<p>
'Well, I have stopped offering to pay for things in bars.'</p>
<p>
'That's a start.'</p>
<p>
'It was a very easy habit to break.'</p>
<p>
'Par for the course. That all?'</p>
<p>
'Well... also, your women are very friendly.'</p>
<p>
'So are the men,' Sma arched one eyebrow.</p>
<p>
'The life here seems... idyllic.'</p>
<p>
'Well, you have to like crowds, perhaps.'</p>
<p>
He looked round the almost deserted pool complex. 'That's relative, I
suspect.'</p>
<p>
(And thought: the garden; the garden. They have made their life in
its image!)</p>
<p>
'Why,' Sma smiled. 'Are you tempted to stay?'</p>
<p>
'Not even slightly.' He laughed. 'I'd go crazy here, or slip forever
into one of your shared dream-games. I need... more.'</p>
<p>
'But will you take it from us?' Sma said, stopping, treading water.
'Do you want to work with us?'</p>
<p>
'Everybody seems to think I should; they believe you're fighting the
good fight. It's just that... I get suspicious when everybody agrees
about something.'</p>
<p>
Sma laughed. 'How much would it matter if we weren't fighting the
good fight, Cheradenine? If all we were offering was pay and
excitement?'</p>
<p>
'I don't know,' he admitted. 'It would make it even harder. I'd just
like... I'd like to believe, to finally <I>know</I>, to finally be
able to prove that I was...' He shrugged, grinned. '... doing good.'</p>
<p>
Sma sighed. In the water, this meant that she bobbed up then sank
down a little. 'Who knows, Zakalwe? We don't know that; we think
we're right; we even think we can prove it, but we can never be sure;
there are always arguments against us. There is no certainty; least
of all in Special Circumstances, where the rules are different.'</p>
<p>
'I thought the rules were meant to be the same for everybody.'</p>
<p>
'They are. But in Special Circumstances we deal in the moral
equivalent of black holes, where the normal laws - the rules of right
and wrong that people imagine apply everywhere else in the universe -
break down; beyond those metaphysical event-horizons, there exist...
special circumstances.' She smiled. 'That's us. That's our territory;
our domain.'</p>
<p>
'To some people,' he said, 'that might sound like just a good excuse
for bad behaviour.'</p>
<p>
Sma shrugged. 'And perhaps they would be right. Maybe that is all it
is.' She shook her head, pulled one hand through her long wet hair.
'But if nothing else, at least we need an excuse; think how many
people need none at all.'</p>
<p>
She swam off.</p>
<p>
He watched her stroke powerfully away through the water for a moment.
One of his hands went, without him really realising it, to a small
puckered scar on his chest, just over where his heart was, and rubbed
it, while he frowned, staring at the glittering, unsteady surface of
the water.</p>
<p>
Then he swam after the woman.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He spent a couple of years on the <I>Size Isn't Everything</I>, and
on a few of the planets, rocks, habitats and orbitals it stopped at.
He was being trained, and learning to use some of the new abilities
he had let them give him. When he eventually left the craft, to go on
his first tour of duty for the Culture - a series of missions which
culminated in him taking the Chosen to the Perfumed Palace on the
cliff - it was on a ship just starting its second tour of duty; the
General Contact Unit <I>Sweet and Full of Grace.</I></p>
<p>
He never saw Chori again, and heard that she'd been killed on active
service some fifteen years later. He was told this news while they
were regrowing his body on the GSV <I>Congenital Optimist</I> after
he'd been beheaded on - and then rescued from - a planet called
Fohls.</p>

<p>
He crouched behind the parapet, at the far edge of the old
observatory from the single approaching plane. Behind him, down a
steep slope, were bushes and trees and a collection of roofless,
overgrown buildings. He watched the aircraft come closer, checked for
more coming from other directions, but couldn't find any. Inside the
suit, watching the transmitted view, he frowned as the aircraft came
closer, slowing all the time, its obese arrowhead shape silhouetted
against the sunset as it approached.</p>
<p>
He watched it drop slowly towards the observatory platform; a ramp
hinged from the craft's belly; three legs flexed out. He took some
effector readings from the machine, then shook his head, ducked and
ran back down the slope.</p>
<p>
Tsoldrin was sitting in one of the ruined buildings. He looked
surprised when the suited figure entered through the creeper-choked
doorway.</p>
<p>
'Yes, Cheradenine?'</p>
<p>
'It's a civilian craft,' he said, pushing the face-plate up. He was
grinning. 'I don't think it's looking for us after all. Might still
provide an escape route, though.' He shrugged. 'Worth a try.' He
gestured back up the slope. 'You coming along?'</p>
<p>
Tsoldrin Beychae looked through the dusk at the matt black figure in
the doorway. He had been sitting here wondering what he ought to do,
and had not yet come up with any answers. Part of him just wanted to
get back to the peace and quiet and certainty of the university
library, where he could live happily, without fuss, ignore the world,
and immerse himself in the old books, trying to understand ancient
ideas and histories, hoping to make sense of them, one day, and
perhaps explain his own ideas, try to point out the lessons of these
elder histories, perhaps make people think again about their own
times and ideologies. For a time - for a long time, there - it had
seemed entirely and definitely the most worthwhile and productive
thing he could do... but he was not sure of that any longer.</p>
<p>
Perhaps, he thought, there were more important things to be done
which he could have a hand in. Perhaps he ought to go with Zakalwe,
as the man - and the Culture - wanted.</p>
<p>
Could he just relapse back into his studies, after this?</p>
<p>
Zakalwe coming back from the past, as rash and brash as ever; Ubrel -
could she really have been? - just acting a part, making him feel
very old and foolish, now, but angry as well; and the whole Cluster
drifting rudderless towards the rocks, all over again.</p>
<p>
Did he have any right not to try and do something, even if the
Culture was wrong about his stature in the civilisation? He didn't
know. He could see that Zakalwe had tried to appeal to his vanity,
but what if even half of what he said was true? Was it right to sit
back and just let things happen, however much it might be the
easiest, least stressful course? If there was a war, and he knew he'd
done nothing, how would he feel afterwards?</p>
<p>
Damn you, Zakalwe, he thought. He stood up. 'I'm still thinking,' he
said. 'But let's see how far you can get.'</p>
<p>
'Good man.' The suited figure's voice betrayed no obvious trace of
emotion.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'... <I>Extremely</I> sorry for the delay, gentlepeople; it really
wasn't within our control; some sort of traffic control panic, but do
let me apologise again on behalf of Heritage Tours. Well; here we
are, a bit later than we expected (but isn't that a pretty sunset?);
the <I>very famous</I> Srometren Observatory; at least four and a
half thousand years of history have been played out beneath your feet
here, gentlepeople. I'm going to have to fairly rattle through it to
tell it all to you in the time we have here, so listen close...'</p>
<p>
The aircraft hovered, AG field buzzing, just above the western edge
of the observatory platform. Its legs hung, dangling in mid-air,
apparently extended merely as a precaution. About forty people had
disembarked from it down the belly-ramp, and now stood around one of
the stone instrument plinths while an eager young tour guide talked
to them.</p>
<p>
He watched through the stone balustrade, scanning the group with the
suit's built-in effector and watching the results on the visor-screen
head-up. Thirty plus of the people were carrying what were in effect
terminals; links to the planet's communications net. The suit's
computer covertly interrogated the terminals through the effector.
Two of the terminals were switched on; one receiving a sports
broadcast, another receiving music. The rest were on stand-by.</p>
<p>
'Suit,' he whispered (not that even Tsoldrin, right beside him, could
have heard him, let alone the people in the tourist group). 'I want
to disable those terminals, quietly; to stop them from transmitting.'</p>
<p>
'Two receiving terminals are transmitting location code,' the suit
said.</p>
<p>
'Can I disable their transmit function without altering their present
location code function, or their present reception?'</p>
<p>
'Yes.'</p>
<p>
'Right; the priority being preventing any further new signals,
disable all the terminals.'</p>
<p>
'Disabling all thirty-four non-Culture personal commnet terminals
within range; confirm.'</p>
<p>
'Confirmed, dammit; do it...'</p>
<p>
'Order carried out.'</p>
<p>
He watched the head-up alter as the internal power-states of the
terminals sank back to near zero. The tour guide was leading the
people across the stone plateau of the old observatory, towards
where he and Beychae were, and away from the hovering aircraft.</p>
<p>
He shoved the suit face-plate up, looked round at the other man.
'Okay; let's go. Quietly.'</p>
<p>
He went first, through the undergrowth, between the crowding trees;
it was quite dark under the half-fallen foliage, and Beychae stumbled
a couple of times, but they made relatively little noise as they
trod the carpet of dead leaves round two sides of the observatory
platform.</p>
<p>
When they were under the aircraft, he scanned it with the suit
effector.</p>
<p>
'You beautiful little machine,' he breathed, watching the results
come up. The aircraft was automatic, and very stupid. A bird probably
had a more complicated brain. 'Suit; patch into the aircraft; assume
control without letting anybody else know.'</p>
<p>
'Assuming covert control-jurisdiction of single aircraft within
range; confirm.'</p>
<p>
'Confirmed. And stop asking me to confirm everything.'</p>
<p>
'Control-jurisdiction assumed. Lapsing confirmatory instruction
protocols; confirm.'</p>
<p>
'Good grief. Confirmed!'</p>
<p>
'Confirm protocol lapsed.'</p>
<p>
He considered just floating up, holding Beychae, into the craft, but
even though the aircraft's own AG would probably mask the signal his
suit gave off, it might not. He glanced up the steep slope, then
turned to Beychae and whispered. 'Give me your hand; we're going up.'
The old man did as he asked.</p>
<p>
They went steadily up the slope, the suit kicking foot-holds in the
earth. They stopped at the balustrade. The aircraft blocked out the
evening sky above them, yellow light spilling from the belly entrance
above the ramp, faintly illuminating the nearer stone instruments.</p>
<p>
He checked on the tour group while Beychae got his breath back. The
tourists were at the far side of the observatory; the guide was
shining a flashlight at some ancient piece of stonework. He stood
up. 'Let's go,' he told Beychae, who straightened. They stepped over
the balustrade, walked to the ramp and up into the aircraft. He
followed Beychae; he watched the rear view on the helmet screen, but
couldn't tell whether anybody in the tour group had noticed them or
not.</p>
<p>
'Suit; close the ramp,' he told the suit, as he and Beychae entered
the single large space of the craft's interior. It was ornately
luxurious, its walls slung with hangings and its deeply carpeted
floor dotted with large chairs and couches; there was an autobar at
one end, while the opposite wall was a single huge screen, presently
displaying the last of the sunset.</p>
<p>
The ramp chimed and hissed as it came up. 'Suit; retract legs,' he
said, hinging the suit face-plate back. Happily, the suit was smart
enough to realise he meant the aircraft's legs, not its own. It had
occurred to him that somebody might just be able to leap onto one of
the craft's legs from the observatory balustrade. 'Suit; adjust
aircraft altitude; up ten metres.'</p>
<p>
The light buzzing noise around them changed, then settled back to
what it had been before. He watched Beychae take off his heavy
jacket, then looked round the interior of the craft; the effector
said there was nobody else aboard, but he wanted to make sure. 'Let's
see where this thing was headed next,' he said, as Beychae sat down
on a long couch, sighing and stretching. 'Suit; the aircraft's next
destination?'</p>
<p>
'Gipline Space Terminal,' the clipped voice told him.</p>
<p>
'That sounds perfect. Take us there, suit, and make it look as legal
and normal as possible.'</p>
<p>
'Under way,' the suit said. 'ETA forty minutes.'</p>
<p>
The craft's background noise altered, climbing in pitch; the floor
moved just a little. The screen on the far side of the large cabin
showed them moving out across the wooded hills, rising into the air.</p>
<p>
He took a walk round the craft, confirming there was nobody else
aboard, then sat by Beychae, who he thought looked very tired. It had
been a long day, he supposed.</p>
<p>
'You all right?'</p>
<p>
'I'm glad to be sitting down, I'll say that.' Beychae kicked off his
boots.</p>
<p>
'Let me get you a drink, Tsoldrin,' he said, taking off the helmet
and heading for the bar. 'Suit,' he said, suddenly struck by an idea.
'You know one of the Culture's down-link numbers in Solotol.'</p>
<p>
'Yes.'</p>
<p>
'Connect with one via the aircraft.'</p>
<p>
He bent down, looking at the autobar. 'And how does this work?'</p>
<p>
'The autobar is voice acti -'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe!' Sma's voice cut across that of the suit, making him start.
He straightened. 'Where are...?' the woman's voice said, then paused.
'Oh; you've got yourself an aircraft, have you?'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' he said. He looked across to where Beychae was watching him.
'On our way to Gipline Port. So what happened? Where's that module?
And Sma, I'm hurt; you haven't called, you haven't written, sent
flowers...'</p>
<p>
'Is Beychae all right?' Sma said urgently.</p>
<p>
'Tsoldrin's fine,' he told her, smiling at the other man. 'Suit; get
this autobar to fix us a couple of refreshing but strong drinks.'</p>
<p>
'He's okay; good.' The woman sighed. The autobar made a clicking,
gurgling noises. 'We haven't called,' Sma said, 'because if we had
we'd have let them know where you were; we lost the tight-link when
the capsule got blasted. Zakalwe, that was ridiculous; it was pure
chaos after the capsule wasted the truck in the Flower Market and you
downed that fighter; you're lucky you made it as far as you did.
Where is the capsule, anyway?'</p>
<p>
'Back at the observatory; Srometren,' he said, looking down as a
hatch opened in the autobar. He took the tray with the two drinks on
it over to Beychae, sat down at his side. 'Sma; say hello to Tsoldrin
Beychae,' he said, handing the other man his drink.</p>
<p>
'Mr Beychae?' Sma's voice said from the suit.</p>
<p>
'Hello?' Beychae said.</p>
<p>
'Pleased to talk to you Mr Beychae. I do hope Mr Zakalwe is treating
you all right. Are you well?'</p>
<p>
'Tired, but hale.'</p>
<p>
'I trust Mr Zakalwe has found time to communicate to you the
seriousness of the political situation in the Cluster.'</p>
<p>
'He has,' Beychae said. 'I am... I am certainly considering doing
what you ask, and for the moment have no urge to return to Solotol.'</p>
<p>
'I see,' Sma said, 'I appreciate what you say. I'm sure Mr Zakalwe
will do all he can to keep you safe and well while you're
deliberating, won't you, Cheradenine?'</p>
<p>
'Of course, Diziet. Now; where's that module?'</p>
<p>
'Stuck under the cloud tops of Soreraurth, where it was before.
Thanks to your nova-profile escapades down there, everything's on
maximum alert; we can't move anything without being seen, and if
we're seen to be interfering, we might start the war all by
ourselves. Describe where that capsule is again; we're going to have
to passive-spot it from the microsatellite and then blast it from up
here, to remove the evidence. Shit, this is messy, Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
'Well, pardon me,' he said. He drank again. 'The capsule's under a
large yellow-leafed deciduous tree between eighty and... one-thirty
metres north-east of the observatory. Oh; and the plasma rifle's
about... twenty to forty metres due west.'</p>
<p>
'You lost it?' Sma sounded incredulous.</p>
<p>
'Threw it away in a fit of pique,' he admitted, yawning. 'It got
Effectorized.'</p>
<p>
'Told you it belonged in a museum,' another voice interrupted.</p>
<p>
'Shut-up, Skaffen-Amtiskaw,' he said. 'So, Sma, what now?'</p>
<p>
'Gipline Space Terminal, I suppose,' the woman replied. 'We'll see if
we can book you on something outgoing; for Impren, or nearby. At
worst, you've got a civilian trip ahead of you of weeks at least; if
we're lucky they'll stand down the alert and the module can sneak out
and rendezvous. Either way though, the war may be a little closer,
thanks to what happened in Solotol today. Just think about that,
Zakalwe.' The channel closed.</p>
<p>
'She sounds unhappy with you, Cheradenine,' Beychae said.</p>
<p>
He shrugged. 'No change there,' he sighed.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'I'm really most terribly sorry, gentlepeople; this has never
happened before; never. I really am sorry... I just can't understand
it... I'll, um... I'll try...' The young man hit buttons on his
pocket terminal. 'Hello? Hello! HELLO!' He shook it, banged it with
the heel of his hand. 'This is just... just... this has never, never
happened before; it really hasn't...' He looked apologetically up at
the people in the tour group, clustered round the single light. Most
of the people were looking at him; a few were trying their own
terminals with no more success than he, and a couple were watching
the western sky as though the last red smudge there would give up the
aircraft that had so mysteriously decided to leave of its own accord,
'Hello? Hello? Anybody? Please reply.' The young man sounded almost
in tears. The very last dreg of light left the sunset sky; moon-glow
lit up some thinner patches of cloud. The flashlight flickered.
'Anybody at all; please reply! Oh, please!'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Skaffen-Amtiskaw got back in touch a few minutes later to say that he
and Beychae had cabins reserved on a clipper called the <I>Osom
Emananish</I>, heading for Breskial System, just three light years
from Impren; the hope was that the module would get to them before
that. It would probably have to; their trail would almost certainly
be picked up. 'It might be an idea for Mr Beychae to alter his
appearance,' the drone's smooth voice told them.</p>
<p>
He looked up at the wall-drapes. 'I suppose we could try and make
some clothes out of stuff here,' he said doubtfully.</p>
<p>
'The aircraft baggage hold might prove a more fruitful source of
attire,' the drone's voice purred, and told him how to open the floor
hatch.</p>
<p>
He surfaced with two suitcases, wrenched them open. 'Clothes!' he
said. He took some out; they looked sufficiently unisex.</p>
<p>
'And you'll have to lose your suit and weaponry, too,' the drone
said.</p>
<p>
'<I>What</I>?'</p>
<p>
'You'll never get on board a ship with that stuff, Zakalwe, even with
our help. You've to pack it all in something - one of those cases
would be ideal - and leave it in the port; we'll try and pick it up
once the heat's off.'</p>
<p>
'But!'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Beychae himself suggested they shaved his head, when they were
discussing how to disguise him. The last use the wonderfully
sophisticated combat suit was put to was as a razor. Then he took it
off; they both changed into the rather loud but thankfully
loose-fitting clothes.</p>
<p>
The craft landed; the Space Terminal was a wilderness of concrete
lined off like a game board by the lifts that took craft down to and
up from the handling facilities.</p>
<p>
Tight beam established again, the earring terminal could whisper to
him, guide him and Beychae.</p>
<p>
But he felt naked without the suit.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
They stepped from the aircraft into a hangar; pleasantly forgettable
music tinkled. Nobody met them. They could hear a distant alarm.</p>
<p>
The earring terminal indicated which door to take. They moved along a
staff-only corridor, through two security doors which swung open for
them even before they got to them, then - after a pause - came out
into a huge crowded concourse full of people, screens, kiosks and
seats. Nobody noticed them, because a moving walkway had just slammed
to a stop, toppling dozens of people on top of each other.</p>
<p>
A security camera in the left luggage area swung up to look at the
ceiling for the minute it took them to deposit the suitcase with the
suit in it. The instant they'd gone, the camera resumed its slow
sweeping.</p>
<p>
More or less the same happened when they picked up their tickets at
the appropriate desk. Then, while they were walking along another
corridor, they saw a party of armed security guards enter from the
other end.</p>
<p>
He just kept on walking. He sensed Beychae hesitate at his side. He
turned, smiled easily at the other man, and when he turned back, the
guards were stopped, the leading guard holding one hand to his ear
and looking at the floor; he nodded, turned and pointed to a side
corridor; the guards set off down it.</p>
<p>
'We're not just being incredibly lucky, I take it?' Beychae muttered.</p>
<p>
He shook his head. 'Not unless you count it as incredibly lucky that
we've got a near military-standard electro-magnetic effector
controlled by a hyper-fast starship Mind working this entire port
like an arcade game from a light-year or so off, no.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
They were passed through a VIP channel to the small shuttle that
would take them to the orbiting station. The final security check was
the only one the ship couldn't rig; a man with practised eyes and
hands. He seemed happy they had nothing dangerous on them. The
earring jabbed his ear as they passed down another corridor; more
X-rays, and a strong magnetic field, both manually controlled, double
checking.</p>
<p>
The shuttle flight was relatively uneventful; in the station, they
passed across one transit lounge - in something of a commotion, due
to a man with a direct neural implant seemingly having a fit on the
floor - straight into a final security check.</p>
<p>
In the corridor between the lounge lock and the ship, he heard Sma's
voice, tiny in his ear. 'That's it, Zakalwe. Can't tight beam on the
ship without being spotted. We'll only contact in a real emergency.
Use the Solotol phonelink if you want to talk, but remember it'll be
monitored. Goodbye; good luck.'</p>
<p>
And then he and Beychae were through another air lock, and on the
clipper <I>Osom Emananish</I>, which would take them into
interstellar space.</p>
<p>
He spent the hour or so before departure walking round the clipper,
just checking it all out, so that he knew where everything was.</p>
<p>
The speaker system, and most of the visible screens, announced their
departure. The clipper drifted, then dawdled, then raced away from
the station; it swung away past the sun and the gas-giant Soreraurth.
Soreraurth was where the module was having to keep hidden, a hundred
kilometres deep in the vast perpetual storm that was the mighty
planet's atmosphere. An atmosphere that would be plundered, mined,
stripped and altered by the Humanists, if they had their way. He
watched the gas-giant fall astern, wondered who was really right and
wrong, and felt an odd helplessness.</p>
<p>
He was passing through the bustle of a small bar, on his way to check
on Beychae, when he heard a voice behind him say, 'Ah; sincere
hellos, and things! Mr Starabinde, isn't it?'</p>
<p>
He turned slowly.</p>
<p>
It was the small doctor from the scar party. The little man stood at
the crowded bar, beckoning to him.</p>
<p>
He walked over, squeezing between the chattering passengers.</p>
<p>
'Doctor; good day.'</p>
<p>
The little man nodded, 'Stapangarderslinaiterray; but call me Stap.'</p>
<p>
'With pleasure, and even relief.' He smiled. 'And please call me
Sherad.'</p>
<p>
'Well! Small cluster, isn't it? May I buy you a drink?' He flashed
his toothy grin, which - caught in a small spotlight above the bar -
glared quite startlingly.</p>
<p>
'What an excellent idea.'</p>
<p>
They found a small table, wedged up against one bulkhead. The doctor
wiped his nose, adjusted his immaculate suit.</p>
<p>
'So, Sherad, what brings you along on this little jaunt?'</p>
<p>
'Well, actually... Stap,' he said quietly. 'I'm travelling sort of...
incognito, so I'd appreciate it if you didn't... broadcast my name,
you know?'</p>
<p>
'Absolutely!' Doctor Stap said, nodding fiercely. He glanced round
conspiratorially, leaned closer. 'My discretion is exemplary. Have
had to &quot;travel quietly&quot;...' his eyebrows waggled '...
myself, on occasion. You just let me know if I can be of any help.'</p>
<p>
'You're very kind.' He raised his glass.</p>
<p>
They drank to a safe voyage.</p>
<p>
'Are you going to the &quot;end of the line&quot;, to Breskial?' Stap
asked.</p>
<p>
He nodded. 'Yes; myself and a business associate.'</p>
<p>
Doctor Stap nodded, grinning. 'Ah, a &quot;business associate&quot;
Ah.'</p>
<p>
'No, doctor; not a &quot;business associate&quot;, a business
associate; a gentleman, and quite elderly, and in a different
cabin... would that all three descriptions were their opposite, of
course.'</p>
<p>
'Ha! Quite!' the doctor said.</p>
<p>
'Another drink?'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'You don't think he knows anything?' Beychae asked.</p>
<p>
'What's to know?' He shrugged. He glanced at the screen, on the door
of Beychae's cramped cabin. 'Nothing on the news?'</p>
<p>
'Nothing,' Beychae said. 'They mentioned an all-ports security
exercise, but nothing directly about you or me.'</p>
<p>
'Well, we probably aren't in any more danger because the doc's aboard
than we were already.'</p>
<p>
'How much is that?'</p>
<p>
'Too much. They're bound to work out what happened eventually; we'll
never get to Breskial before they do.'</p>
<p>
'Then?'</p>
<p>
'Then, unless I can think of something, the Culture either has to let
us be taken back, or take this ship over, which is going to be tricky
to explain, and bound to remove some of your credibility.'</p>
<p>
'<I>If</I> I decide to do as you ask, Cheradenine.'</p>
<p>
He looked at the other man, sitting alongside him on the narrow bed.
'Yeah; if.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He prowled the ship. The clipper seemed cramped and crowded; he'd got
too used to Culture vessels, he supposed. There were plans of the
ship available on-screen, and he studied them, but they were really
just for people to find their way about, and provided little useful
information on how the ship might be taken over or disabled. Judging
from watching the crew when they appeared, entry to crew-only areas
was by voice and/or hand-print match.</p>
<p>
There was little flammable on board, nothing explosive, and most of
the circuitry was optical rather than electronic. Doubtless the
<I>Xenophobe</I> could make the clipper <I>Osom Emananish</I> dance
and sing with the effector equivalent of one hand tied behind its
back, from somewhere in the next stellar system, but without the
combat suit or a weapon, he was going to have a tough job trying to
do anything, if and when it came to it.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the clipper crawled through space; Beychae stayed in his
cabin, catching up on the news via the screen, and sleeping.</p>
<p>
'I seem to have swapped one subtle form of imprisonment for another,
Cheradenine,' he observed, the day after they left, as the other man
brought him supper.</p>
<p>
'Tsoldrin, don't go cabin crazy; if you want to go out, go out. It's
a little safer this way, but... well, only a little.'</p>
<p>
'Well,' Tsoldrin said, taking the tray and lifting the cover to
inspect the contents. 'For now it's easy enough to treat the news and
current affairs casts as my research material, so I do not feel
unduly confined.' He set the cover aside. 'But a couple of weeks
might be asking rather too much, Cheradenine.'</p>
<p>
'Don't worry,' he said, dejectedly. 'I doubt it'll come to that.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Ah; Sherad!' The small fussy shape of Doctor Stap sidled up to him a
day later, while people were watching a magnified view of an
impressive gas-giant in a nearby system slide past on the principle
lounge main screen. The small doctor took his elbow. 'I'm having a
small private party, this evening, in the Starlight Lounge; one of
my, um, <I>special</I> parties, you know? I wondered if you and your
hermit-like business partner might like to participate?'</p>
<p>
'They let you <I>aboard</I> with that thing?' he laughed.</p>
<p>
'Shh, good sir,' the doctor said, pulling the other man away from the
press of people. 'I have a long-standing arrangement with the
shipping line; my machine is recognised as being of primary medical
importance.'</p>
<p>
'Sounds expensive. You must have to charge a lot, doctor.'</p>
<p>
'There is, of course, a small consideration involved, but well within
the means of most cultured people, and I can assure you of some very
exclusive company, and complete discretion, as ever.'</p>
<p>
'Thank you for the offer, Doctor, but I'm afraid not.'</p>
<p>
'It really is the opportunity of a lifetime; you are most lucky to
have the chance a second time.'</p>
<p>
'I'm sure. Perhaps if it occurs a third time. Excuse me.' He patted
Stap on the shoulder. 'Oh; shall I see you for drinks this evening?'</p>
<p>
The doctor shook his head. 'I'll be setting up; preparing, I'm
afraid, Sherad.' He looked somehow plaintive. 'It is a <I>great</I>
opportunity,' he said, toothily.</p>
<p>
'Oh, I'm well aware of that, Doctor Stap.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'You're a wicked man.'</p>
<p>
'Thank you. It's taken years of diligent practice.'</p>
<p>
'I bet.'</p>
<p>
'Oh no; you're going to tell me you're not wicked at all; I can see
it in your eyes. Yes; yes, it's there; purity! I recognise the
symptoms. But,' he put one hand on her forearm, 'don't worry. It can
be cured.'</p>
<p>
She pushed him away, but only with the softest of pressures. 'You're
terrible.' The hand that had pushed him away lingered just for a
moment on his chest. 'You're bad.'</p>
<p>
'I confess. You have seen into my soul...' He looked round for a
second, as the background noise of the ship altered. He smiled back
at the lady. 'But, ah, it gives me such succour to confess to one so
close to a goddess-like beauty.'</p>
<p>
She laughed throatily, her slender neck exposed as she put her head
back. 'Do you <I>normally</I> get anywhere with this line?' she
asked, shaking her head.</p>
<p>
He looked hurt, shook his head sadly. 'Oh, why are beautiful women so
cynical these days?'</p>
<p>
Then he saw her gaze shift to somewhere behind him.</p>
<p>
He turned. 'Yes, Officer?' he said to one of the two junior officers
he found standing behind him. Both had guns in open holsters.</p>
<p>
'Mr... Sherad?' the young man said.</p>
<p>
He watched the young officer's eyes and suddenly felt sick; the man
knew. They'd been traced. Somebody somewhere had put the numbers
together and come up with the right answer. 'Yes?' he said, grinning
rather stupidly. 'You guys wanna drink?' He laughed, looked round at
the woman.</p>
<p>
'No thank you, sir. Would you come with us please?'</p>
<p>
'Whassa matter?' he said, sniffing, then draining his glass. He wiped
his hands on the lapels of his jacket. 'Captain need some help
steering the ship, yeah?' he laughed, slid off his bar stool, turned
to the woman, took her hand and kissed it. 'My dear lady; I bid you
farewell, until we meet again.' He put both hands to his chest. 'But
always remember this; there is forever a piece of my heart that
belongs to you.'</p>
<p>
She smiled uncertainly. He laughed loudly, turned and bumped into the
bar stool. 'Whoops!' he said.</p>
<p>
'This way, Mr Sherad,' the first one said. 'Yeah; yeah; just
wherever.'</p>
<p>
He'd hoped they'd take him into the crew-only section, but when they
got into the small lift, they pressed for the lowest deck; stores,
non-vacuum luggage, and the brig.</p>
<p>
'I think I'm going to be sick,' he said, as soon as the doors closed.
He bent over, retched, forcing out the last few drinks.</p>
<p>
One jumped out of the way, to keep his shiny boots clean; the other,
he sensed, was bending down, putting one hand to his back.</p>
<p>
He stopped throwing up, slammed one elbow up into the man's nose; he
crashed back into the elevator's rear doors. The second man hadn't
quite recovered his balance. He straightened and punched him
straight in the face. The second one folded, knees then backside
hammering into the floor. The lift chimed, stopped between decks, its
weight-limit alarm triggered by all the commotion. He thumped the
topmost button and the lift started up.</p>
<p>
He took the guns from the two unconscious officers; neural stunners.
He shook his head. The elevator chimed again. The floor they'd left.
He stepped forward, stuffing the two stun guns into his jacket as he
braced his feet in the far corners of the small space, straddling the
two men, and pressed his hands against the doors. He grunted with the
effort of holding the doors closed, but eventually the elevator gave
up the struggle. Still holding the doors with both hands, he twisted
his body until he got his head to the topmost button, and pressed it
with his forehead. The lift hummed upwards again.</p>
<p>
When the doors opened, three people stood outside, on the private
lounge level. They looked at the two unconscious guards and the small
watery pool of vomit. Then he zapped them with the stun guns, and
they fell. He pulled one of the officers half out of the elevator so
the lift couldn't close its doors, and used a stun gun on both men
too.</p>
<p>
The Starlight Lounge door was closed. He pressed the button, looking
back down the corridor, where the lift doors pulsed gently against
the fallen officer's body like some unsubtle lover. There was a
distant chime, and a voice said, 'Please clear the doors. Please
clear the doors.'</p>
<p>
'Yes?' said the door to the Starlight Lounge.</p>
<p>
'Stap; it's Sherad. I changed my mind.'</p>
<p>
'Excellent!' The door opened.</p>
<p>
He went quickly inside, hit the shut button. The modest lounge was
full of drug smoke, low light, and mutilated people. Music played,
and all eyes - not all of them in their sockets - turned to him. The
doctor's tall grey machine was over near the bar, where a couple of
people were serving.</p>
<p>
He got the doctor between him and the others, stuck the stun gun
under the little man's chin. 'Bad news, Stap. These things can be
fatal at close range, and this one's on maximum. I need your machine.
I'd prefer to have your co-operation, too, but I can get by without
it. I'm <I>very</I> serious, and in a terrible hurry, so what's it to
be?'</p>
<p>
Stap made a gurgling noise.</p>
<p>
'Three,' he said, pressing the stun gun a little harder into the
little doctor's neck. 'Two,...'</p>
<p>
'All right! This way!'</p>
<p>
He let him go, following Stap across the floor to the tall machine he
used for his strange trade. He kept his hands together, stun pistols
hidden up each sleeve; he nodded to a few people as they passed. He
spotted a clear line of fire to somebody on the far side of the
room, just for an instant. He zapped them; they fell spectacularly
onto a laden table. While everybody was looking there, he and Stap -
prodded once to keep going when the crash came from the distant table
- got to the machine.</p>
<p>
'Excuse me,' he said to one of the bar girls. 'Would you help the
doctor?' He nodded behind the bar. 'He wants to move the machine
through there, don't you, Doc?'</p>
<p>
They entered the small store room behind the bar. He thanked the girl
outside, closed the door, locked it, and shifted a pile of containers
in front of it. He smiled at the alarmed-looking doctor.</p>
<p>
'See that wall behind you, Stap?'</p>
<p>
The doctor's gaze flicked that way.</p>
<p>
'We're going through it, Doc, with your machine.'</p>
<p>
'You can't! You...'</p>
<p>
He put the stun gun against the man's forehead. Stap closed his eyes.
A corner of handkerchief, protruding from a breast pocket, trembled.</p>
<p>
'Stap; I think I know how that machine must work to do what it does.
I want a cutting field; a slicer that'll take molecular bonds apart.
If you won't do it, and right now, I'll put you out and try it
myself, and if I get it wrong and fuse the fucker, you're going to
have some very, very unhappy customers out there; they might even do
what you've done to them, but without the old machine here, hmm?'</p>
<p>
Stap swallowed. 'Mm...' he began. One of his hands moved slowly
towards his jacket. 'Mmm... mmm... my t-t-tool k-kit.'</p>
<p>
He took the wallet of tools out, turned shakily to the machine and
opened a panel.</p>
<p>
The door behind them chimed. He found some sort of chromed bar
utensil on a shelf, moved the containers in front of the door aside -
Stap looked round, but saw the gun was still pointed at him, and
turned back - and jammed the piece of metal into the gap between the
sliding door and its housing. The door gave an outraged chirp, and a
red light blinked urgently on the open/close button. He slid the
containers back again.</p>
<p>
'Hurry up, Stap,' he said.</p>
<p>
'I'm doing all I can!' the little doctor yelped. The machine made a
deep buzzing noise. Blue light played around a cylindrical section
about a metre from the floor.</p>
<p>
He looked at the section, eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>
'What are you hoping to do?' the doctor said, voice shaking.</p>
<p>
'Just keep working, Doc; you have half a minute before I try doing it
myself.' He looked over the doctor's shoulder, saw him fiddling with
a circular control mapped out in degrees.</p>
<p>
All he could hope to do was get the machine going and then attack
whatever parts of the ship he could. Disable it, somehow. All ships
tended to be complicated, and, to a degree, the cruder a ship was,
paradoxically the more complicated it was too. He just had to hope he
could hit something vital without blowing the thing up.</p>
<p>
'Nearly ready,' the doctor said. He looked nervously backwards, one
shaking finger going towards a small red button.</p>
<p>
'Okay, Doc,' he told the trembling man, looking suspiciously at the
blue light playing round the cylindrical section. He squatted down
level with the doctor. 'Go on,' he nodded.</p>
<p>
'Um...' The doctor swallowed. 'It might be better if you stood back,
over there.'</p>
<p>
'No. Let's just try it, eh?' He hit the little red button. A
hemi-disc of blue light shot out over their heads from the
cylindrical section of the machine and sliced through the containers
he had stacked against the door; fluids spurted out of them. The
shelves to one side collapsed, supports severed by the humming blue
disc. He grinned at the wreckage; if he'd still been standing, the
blue field would have cut him in half.</p>
<p>
'Nice try, Doc,' he said. The little doctor slumped to the floor like
a pile of wet sand as the stun pistol hummed. Snack packets and drink
cartons showered onto the floor from the demolished shelves; the ones
falling through the blue beam hit the floor shredded; drink poured
from the punctured containers in front of the door. There was a
thumping noise coming from behind the containers.</p>
<p>
He rather appreciated the heady smell of alcohol filling the store
room, but hoped there weren't enough spirits involved to cause a
fire. He spun the machine around, splashing through the drink
gradually collecting on the floor of the small store room; the
flickering blue half-disc cut through more shelves before sinking
into the bulkhead opposite the door.</p>
<p>
The machine shook; the air filled with a teeth-cracking whine, and
black smoke spun round against the wrecked shelves as though
propelled by the cutting blue light and then fell quickly to the
surface of the sloshing drink filling the bottom decimetre of the
store room, where it collected like a tiny dark fogbank. He started
manipulating the controls on the machine; a little holo screen showed
the shape of the field; he found a couple of tiny joysticks that
altered it, producing an elliptical field. The machine thumped
harder; the noise rose in pitch and black smoke poured out around
him.</p>
<p>
The thumping from behind the door got louder. The black smoke was
rising in the room, and already he felt light-headed. He pushed hard
against the machine with his shoulder; it trundled forward, howling;
something gave.</p>
<p>
He put his back against the machine and pushed with his feet; there
was a bang from in front of the machine and it started to roll away
from him; he turned, pushed with his shoulder again, staggering past
smoking shelves through a glowing hole into a wrecked room full of
tall metal cabinets. Drink spluttered through the gap. He held the
machine steady for a moment; he opened one of the cabinets, to find a
glittering mass of hair-fine filaments wrapped round cables and
rods. Lights winked on a long thin control board, like some linear
city seen at night.</p>
<p>
He pursed his lips and made a kissing sound at the fibres.
'Congratulations,' he said to himself. 'You have won a major prize.'
He hunkered down at the humming machine, adjusted the controls to
something like the way Stap had had them, but producing a circular
field, then switched it to full power.</p>
<p>
The blue disc slammed into the grey cabinets in a blinding maelstrom
of sparks; the noise was numbing. He left the machine where it was
and waddled away under the blue disc, splashing back into the control
room. He eased himself over the still unconscious doctor, kicked the
containers away from the door and removed the metal tool from the
door. The blue beam wasn't extending far through the gap from the
control room, so he stood up, shoved the door open with his shoulder,
and fell out into the arms of a startled ship's officer, just as the
field machine blew up and blasted both of them across the bar and
into the lounge. All the lights in the lounge went out.</p>

<p>
The hospital ceiling was white, like the walls and the sheets.
Outside, on the surface of the berg, all was white as well. Today was
a whiteout; a bright scour of dry crystals wheeling past the hospital
windows. The last four days had been the same while the storm-wind
blew, and the weather people said they expected no break for another
two or three days. He thought of the troops, hunkered down in
trenches and ice caves, afraid to curse the howling storm, because it
meant there would probably be no fighting. The pilots would be glad
too, but pretend they were not, and would loudly curse the storm that
prevented them flying; having looked at the forecast, most would now
be getting profoundly drunk.</p>
<p>
He watched the white windows. Seeing the blue sky was supposed to be
good for you. That was why they built hospitals on the surface;
everything else was under the surface of the ice. The outer walls of
the hospital were painted bright red, so that they would not be
attacked by enemy aircraft. He had seen enemy hospitals from the air,
strung out across the white glare of the berg's snow hills like
bright drops of blood fallen frozen from some wounded soldier.</p>
<p>
A whorl of whiteness appeared briefly at one window as the snow
flurry circled on some vortex in the gale, then disappeared. He
stared at the falling chaos beyond the layers of glass, eyes
narrowing, as though by sheer concentration he might find some
pattern in the inchoate blizzard. He put one hand up, touching the
white bandage which circled his head.</p>
<p>
His eyes closed, as he tried - again - to remember. His hand fell to
the sheets over his chest.</p>
<p>
'How are we today?' said the young nurse. She appeared at the
bedside, holding a small chair. She placed the chair between his bed
and the empty one to his right. All the other beds were empty; he was
the only person in the ward. There hadn't been a big attack for a
month or so.</p>
<p>
She sat down. He smiled, glad to see her, and glad that she had the
time to stop and talk. 'Okay,' he nodded. 'Still trying to remember
what happened.'</p>
<p>
She smoothed her white uniform over her lap. 'How are your fingers
today?'</p>
<p>
He held up both hands, waggled the fingers on his right hand, then
looked at his left; the fingers moved a little. He frowned. 'About
the same,' he said, as though apologising.</p>
<p>
'You're seeing the doc this afternoon; he'll probably get the physics
to take a look at you.'</p>
<p>
'What I need is a physio for my memory,' he said, closing his eyes
briefly. 'I know there was something important I had to remember...'
His voice trailed off. He realised he'd forgotten the nurse's name.</p>
<p>
'I don't think we have such things,' she smiled. 'Did they have them
where you came from?'</p>
<p>
'This had happened before; yesterday, hadn't it? Hadn't he forgotten
her name yesterday too? He smiled. 'I ought to say I don't remember,'
he said, grinning. 'But no, I don't think they did.'</p>
<p>
He'd forgotten her name yesterday, and the day before, but he'd come
up with a plan; he'd done something about it...</p>
<p>
'Perhaps they didn't need them there, with that thick skull of
yours.'</p>
<p>
She was still smiling. He laughed, trying to remember what the plan
was he'd come up with. Something to do with blowing, with breath, and
paper...</p>
<p>
'Perhaps not,' he agreed. His thick skull; that was why he was here.
A thick skull, a skull thicker or at least more hardy than they were
used to; a thick skull that had not quite shattered when somebody
had shot him in in the head. (But <I>why</I>, when he had not been
fighting at the time, when he'd been amongst his own side, his fellow
pilots?)</p>
<p>
Fractured, instead; fractured, broken, but not smashed
irretrievably... He looked to one side, where there was a little
cabinet. A fold of paper lay on its surface.</p>
<p>
'Don't tire yourself out trying to remember things,' the nurse said.
'Maybe you won't remember things; it doesn't matter very much. Your
mind has to heal too, you know.'</p>
<p>
He heard her talk, took in what she was saying... but he was trying
to remember what it was he'd told himself the day before; that little
slip of paper; he had to do something to it. He blew at it; the top
of the folded paper slip hinged up, so that he could see what was
written underneath; TALIBE. The paper sank back again. He'd angled it
- he remembered now - so that she couldn't see.</p>
<p>
Her name was Talibe. Of course; it sounded familiar.</p>
<p>
'I am healing,' he said. 'But there was something I had to remember,
Talibe. It was important; I know it was.'</p>
<p>
She stood up, patted him on one shoulder. 'Forget it. You mustn't
worry yourself. Why not take a nap; shall I draw the curtains?'</p>
<p>
'No,' he said. 'Can't you stay longer, Talibe?'</p>
<p>
'You need your rest, Cheradenine,' she said, putting one hand to his
brow. 'I'll be back soon, to take your temperature and change your
dressings. Ring the bell if you need anything else.' She patted his
hand, and went away, taking the small white chair with her; she
stopped at the doors, looked back. 'Oh, yes; did I leave a pair of
scissors here, last time I changed your dressing?'</p>
<p>
He looked around him, and shook his head. 'Don't think so.'</p>
<p>
Talibe shrugged. 'Oh well.' She went out of the ward; he heard her
put the chair down on the corridor floor as the doors swung closed.</p>
<p>
He looked at the window again.</p>
<p>
Talibe took the chair away each time because he'd gone crazy when
he'd first seen it, when he woke up for the first time. Even after
that, when his mental state seemed more stable, he would shiver,
wide-eyed with fear when he woke each morning, just because the white
chair was sitting there at the side of his bed. So they had stacked
the ward's few chairs out of his sight, in one corner, and Talibe, or
the doctors, brought the chair in from the corridor with them when
they came to see him.</p>
<p>
He wished he could forget that; forget about the chair, and the
Chairmaker, forget about the Staberinde. Why did that stay sharp and
fresh, after so many years and so long a journey? And yet whatever
had happened just a few days ago - when somebody had shot him, left
him for dead in the hangar - that was dim and vague as something seen
through the storm of snow.</p>
<p>
He stared at the frozen clouds beyond the window, the amorphous
frenzy of the snow. Its meaningless mocked him.</p>
<p>
He slumped down in the bed, letting the piled bedclothes submerge
him, like some drift, and slept, his right hand under the pillow,
curled round one leg of the scissors he'd taken from Talibe's tray
the day before.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'How's the head, old buddy-pal?' Saaz Insile tossed him a fruit which
he failed to catch. He picked it up off his lap, where it had landed
after hitting his chest.</p>
<p>
'Getting better,' he told the other man.</p>
<p>
Insile sat on the nearest bed, threw his cap on the pillow,
unfastened the top button of his uniform. His short, spiky black hair
made his pale face look white as the blankness still filling the
world beyond the ward windows. 'How they treating you?'</p>
<p>
'Fine.'</p>
<p>
'Damn good-looking nurse you've got out there.'</p>
<p>
'Talibe.' He smiled. 'Yes; she's okay.'</p>
<p>
Insile laughed and set back on the bed, supporting himself with his
arms splayed out behind. 'Only &quot;okay&quot;? Zakalwe, she's
gorgeous. You get bed-baths?'</p>
<p>
'No; I'm able to walk to the bathroom.'</p>
<p>
'Want me to break your legs?'</p>
<p>
'Perhaps later.' He laughed.</p>
<p>
Insile laughed a little too, then looked at the storm beyond the
windows. 'How about your memory? Getting any better?' He picked at
the doubled-over white sheet near where his cap lay.</p>
<p>
'No,' he said. In fact he thought it might be, but somehow he didn't
want to tell people; maybe he thought it would be bad luck. 'I
remember being in the mess, and that card game... then...' Then he
remembered seeing the white chair at his bedside and filling his
lungs with all the air in the world and screaming like a hurricane
until the end of time, or at least until Talibe came and calmed him
(Livueta? he'd whispered; Dar... Livueta?). He shrugged.'... then I
was here.'</p>
<p>
'Well,' Saaz said, straightening the crease on his uniform trousers,
'the good news is, we managed to get the blood off the hangar floor.'</p>
<p>
'I expect it to be returned.'</p>
<p>
'Deal, but we're not cleaning it.'</p>
<p>
'How are the others?'</p>
<p>
Saaz sighed, shook his head, smoothed the hair at the back of his
neck. 'Oh, just the same dear lovable fine bunch of lads they ever
were.' He shrugged. 'The rest of the squadron... said to send their
best wishes for a rapid recovery. But you pissed them off that
night.' He looked sadly at the man in the bed. 'Cheri, old pal,
nobody likes the war, but there are ways of saying so... You just did
it wrong. I mean, we all appreciate what you've done; we know this
isn't really your battle, but I think... I think some of the guys...
even feel bad about that. I hear them sometimes; you must have; at
night, having nightmares. You can see that look in their eyes
sometimes, like they know how bad the odds are, and they just aren't
going to come through all this. They're scared; they might try to put
a bullet through <I>my </I>head if I said so to their face, but
scared is what they are. They'd love a way out of this war. They're
brave men, and they want to fight for their country, but they want
out, and nobody who knew the odds would blame them. Any honourable
excuse. They wouldn't shoot themselves in the foot, and nowadays they
won't go for a walk outside in ordinary shoes and come back with
frostbite because too many did that early on; but they'd love a way
out of this. You don't have to be here, but you are; you choose to
fight, and a lot of them resent you for it; it makes them feel like
cowards, because they know that if they were in your boots they'd be
on land, telling the girls what a brave pilot they have the chance to
dance with.'</p>
<p>
'I'm sorry I upset them.' He touched the bandages on his head. 'I'd
no idea they felt <I>this</I> strongly though.'</p>
<p>
'They don't.' Insile frowned. 'That's what's weird.' He got up and
walked over to the nearest window, looking out at the blizzard.</p>
<p>
'Shit, Cheri, half those guys would've gladly invited you into the
hangar and done their best to lose you a couple of teeth, but a <I>gun</I>?'
He shook his head. 'There's not one of those guys I'd trust behind me
with a bread roll or a handful of ice-cubes, but if it was a gun...'
He shook his head again. 'I wouldn't think twice. They just aren't
like that.'</p>
<p>
'Maybe I imagined it all, Saaz,' he said.</p>
<p>
Saaz looked round, a worried expression on his face. It melted a
little when he saw his friend was smiling. 'Cheri; I admit I don't
want to <I>imagine</I> I'm wrong about one of them, but the
alternative is... just somebody else. I don't know who. The military
police don't know either.'</p>
<p>
'I don't think I was much help to them,' he confessed.</p>
<p>
Saaz came back, sat down on the other bed again. 'You really have no
idea who you talked to afterwards? Where you went?'</p>
<p>
'None.'</p>
<p>
'You told me you were going to the briefing room, to check out the
latest targets.'</p>
<p>
'Yes, so I've heard.'</p>
<p>
'But when Jine went there - to invite you to step into the hangar for
saying such terrible things about our high command and our low
tactics - you weren't there.'</p>
<p>
'I don't know what happened, Saaz; I'm sorry, but I just...' He felt
tears prick behind his eyes. The suddenness surprised him. He put the
fruit back down in his lap. He made a very large sniffing noise,
rubbed his nose, and coughed, patted his chest. 'I'm sorry,' he
repeated.</p>
<p>
Insile watched the other man for a moment as he reached for a
handkerchief from the bedside table.</p>
<p>
Saaz shrugged, grinned broadly. 'Hey; never mind. It'll come back to
you. Maybe it was just some loony ground-crewman pissed off because
you'd stepped on his fingers once too often. If you want to remember,
don't try too hard.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah; &quot;Get some rest&quot;, I've heard that before, Saaz.' He
picked the fruit from his lap, placed it on the bedside cabinet.</p>
<p>
'Can I get you anything, for next time?' Insile asked. 'Apart from
Talibe, on whom I may have designs myself if you refuse to rise to
the occasion.'</p>
<p>
'No, thanks.'</p>
<p>
'Booze?'</p>
<p>
'No, I'm saving myself for the mess-room bar.'</p>
<p>
'Books?'</p>
<p>
'Really, Saaz; nothing.'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe,' Saaz laughed. 'There isn't even anybody else here for you
to talk to; what do you <I>do</I> all day?'</p>
<p>
He looked at the window, then back at Saaz. 'I think, quite a lot,'
he said. 'I try to remember.'</p>
<p>
Saaz came over to the bed. He looked very young. He hesitated, then
punched him gently in the chest. He glanced at the bandages. 'Don't
get lost in there, old buddy-pal.'</p>
<p>
He was expressionless for a moment. 'Yeah; don't worry. But anyway,
I'm a good navigator.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
There was something he'd meant to tell Saaz Insile, but he couldn't
remember what that was either. Something that would warn him, because
there was something that he knew about that he hadn't known about
before, and something that required... warning.</p>
<p>
The frustration of it made him want to scream sometimes; to tear the
white plump pillows in half and pick up the white chair and smash it
through the windows to let the mad white fury out there inside.</p>
<p>
He wondered how quickly he'd freeze if the windows were open.</p>
<p>
Well, at least it would be appropriate; he'd arrived here frozen, so
why not leave the same way? He entertained the thought that some
cell-memory, some bone-remembered affinity had drawn him here, of all
places, where the great battles were fought on the titanic crashing
tabular bergs, calved from their vast glaciers and swirling like
ice-cubes in some planet-sized cocktail glass, a scatter of
ever-shifting frozen islands, some of them hundreds of kilometres
long, circling the world between pole and tropic, their broad backs a
white wasteland spattered with blood and bodies, and the wrecks of
tanks and planes.</p>
<p>
To fight for what would inevitably melt and could never provide food
or minerals or a permanent place to live, seemed an almost deliberate
caricature of the conventional folly of war. He enjoyed the fight,
but even the way the war was fought disturbed him, and he had made
enemies amongst the other pilots, and his superiors, by speaking his
mind.</p>
<p>
But somehow he knew that Saaz was right; it had not been what he'd
said in the mess that had led to somebody trying to kill him. At
least (said something in him), not directly...</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Thone, the squadron's CO, came to see him; no flunkies, for a change.</p>
<p>
'Thank you, Nurse,' he said at the door, then closed it, smiled, and
came over to the bed; he had the white chair. He sat in it and drew
himself up, so that his girth was made to look less. 'Well, Captain
Zakalwe, how are we coming along?'</p>
<p>
A flowery smell, Thone's preferred scent, drifted over from the man.
'I hope to be flying within a couple of weeks, sir,' he said. He'd
never liked the CO, but made the effort of smiling bravely.</p>
<p>
'Do you?' Thone said. 'Do you now. That's not what the doctors say,
Captain Zakalwe. Unless they're saying different things to me than
they are to you.'</p>
<p>
He frowned. 'Well, it might be a... few weeks, sir...'</p>
<p>
'It might be we have to send you home, I think, Captain Zakalwe,'
Thone said, with an insincere smiled. '... or at least to the
mainland, as I'm told your home is further afield, eh?'</p>
<p>
'I'm sure I'll be able to return to my duties, sir. Of course, I
realise there will be a medical, but...'</p>
<p>
'Yes, yes, yes,' Thone said. 'Well, we'll just have to see, won't we.
Hmm. Very good.' He stood up. 'Is there anyth -'</p>
<p>
'There's nothing you can get -' He began, then saw the look on
Thone's face. 'I beg your pardon, sir.'</p>
<p>
<I>'As </I>I was saying, <I>Captain;</I> is there anything I can get
you?'</p>
<p>
He looked down at the white sheets. 'No, sir. Thank you, sir.'</p>
<p>
'A speedy recovery, Captain Zakalwe,' Thone said frostily.</p>
<p>
He saluted Thone, who nodded, turned and left.</p>
<p>
He was left looking at the white chair.</p>
<p>
Nurse Talibe came in after a few moments, arms crossed, her round,
pale face very calm and kind. 'Try to sleep,' she told him, and took
the chair away.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He woke in the night and saw the lights shining through the snow
outside; silhouetted against the floodlights, the falling flakes
became translucent shadows, massing soft against the harsh, downward
light. The whiteness beyond, in the black night, came compromised as
grey.</p>
<p>
He woke with the smell of flowers in his nostrils.</p>
<p>
He clutched beneath the pillow, felt the single leg of the sharp,
long-nosed scissor.</p>
<p>
He remembered Thone's face.</p>
<p>
He remembered the briefing room, and the four COs; they'd invited him
for a drink, said they wanted a word.</p>
<p>
In the room of one of them - he couldn't remember their names, but he
would remember soon, and already he would recognise them - they asked
him about what they'd heard he'd said in the mess.</p>
<p>
And, a little drunk, and thinking he was very clever, thinking he
might find out something interesting, he'd told them what he
suspected they wanted to hear, not what he'd said to the other
pilots.</p>
<p>
And had discovered a plot. He wanted the new government to be true to
its populist promises, and end the war. They wanted to stage a coup,
and they needed good pilots.</p>
<p>
High on the drink and his nerves, he'd left them thinking he was for
them, and gone straight to Thone. Thone the hard but fair; Thone the
dislikeable and petty, Thone the vain, the perfumed, but Thone the
man known to be pro-government. (Though Saaz Insile had once said the
man was pro-government with the pilots, and anti-government with
their superiors.)</p>
<p>
And the look on Thone's face...</p>
<p>
Not then; later. After Thone had told him to say nothing to anybody
else, because he thought there might be traitors amongst the pilots
too, and told him to go to bed as though nothing had happened, and
he'd gone, and because he'd still been drunk, maybe, woken up that
second too late as they came for him, shoved some impregnated rag
over his face and held it there while he struggled, but eventually
had to breathe, and the choking fumes took him.</p>
<p>
Dragged through the corridors, socked feet sliding over the tiles;
men on either side. They went to one of the hangars, and somebody
went to the lift controls, and he still could only dimly see the
floor in front of him and could not raise his head. But he could
smell flowers, from the man on his right.</p>
<p>
The clamshell doors opened overhead, cracking; he heard the noise of
the storm, shrieking from the darkness. They dragged him over to the
lift.</p>
<p>
He tensed, swung round, grabbed at Thone's collar; saw the man's
face; appalled, full of fear. He felt the man on the other side of
him grab at his free arm; he wriggled, got his other arm free from
Thone, saw the pistol in the CO's holster.</p>
<p>
He got the gun; he remembered shouting, getting away but falling; he
tried to shoot but the gun would not work. Lights flickered on at the
far side of the hangar. It's not loaded! It's not loaded! Thone
shouted to the others. They looked over to the far side of the
hangar; there were planes in the way, but there was somebody there,
shouting about opening the hangar doors at night with the lights on.</p>
<p>
He never saw who shot him. A sledgehammer hit the side of his head
and the next thing he saw was the white chair.</p>
<p>
The snow boiled wildly beyond the floodlit windows.</p>
<p>
He watched it until dawn, remembering and remembering.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Talibe; will you send a message to Captain Saaz Insile. Tell him I
need to see him, urgently; please send a message to my squadron, will
you?'</p>
<p>
'Yes, of course, but first your medication.'</p>
<p>
He took her hand in his. 'No, Talibe; first phone the squadron.' He
winked at her. 'Please, for me.'</p>
<p>
She shook her head. 'Pest.' She walked away through the doors.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Well, is he coming?'</p>
<p>
'He's on leave,' she told him, taking up the clipboard to check off
the medication he was receiving.</p>
<p>
'Shit!' Saaz hadn't said anything about leave.</p>
<p>
'Captain, tut tut,' she said, shaking a bottle.</p>
<p>
'The police, Talibe. Call the military police; do it now. This really
is urgent.'</p>
<p>
'Medication first, Captain.'</p>
<p>
'Well as soon as I've taken it, you promise?'</p>
<p>
'Promise. Open wide.'</p>
<p>
'Aaaah...'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Damn Saaz for being on leave, and damn him twice for not mentioning
it. And Thone; the nerve of the man! Coming to see him, to check him
out, to see if he remembered.</p>
<p>
And what would have happened if he had?</p>
<p>
He felt under the pillow again, for the scissor. It was there, cool
and sharp.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'I told them it was urgent; they say they're on their way,' Talibe
said, coming in, not with the chair this time. She looked at the
windows, where the storm still blew. 'And I've to give you something
to keep you awake; they want you perky.'</p>
<p>
'I <I>am</I> perky; I <I>am</I> awake!'</p>
<p>
'Quiet, and take these.'</p>
<p>
He took them.</p>
<p>
He fell asleep clutching the scissor under the pillow, while the
whiteness outside the windows went on and on and eventually
penetrated the glass, layer by layer, by a process of discrete
osmosis, and gravitated naturally to his head, and spun slowly in
orbit round him, and joined with the white torus of bandages and
dissolved them and unwound them and deposited the remains in one
corner of the room where the white chairs gathered, muttering,
plotting, and slowly pressed in against his head, tighter and
tighter, whirling in the silly snow-flake dance, faster and faster as
they came closer and closer until eventually they became the bandage,
cold and tight about his fevered head, and - finding the treated
wound - slunk in through his skin and his skull, coldly and crisply
and crystally into his brain.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Talibe unlocked the ward doors and let the officers in.</p>
<p>
'You sure he's out?'</p>
<p>
'I gave him twice the usual dose. If he isn't out he's dead.'</p>
<p>
'Still got a pulse. You take his arms.'</p>
<p>
'Okay... Hup! Hey: look at this!'</p>
<p>
'Huh.'</p>
<p>
'My fault. I wondered where those had got to. Sorry.'</p>
<p>
'You did fine, kid. You better go. Thanks. This won't be forgotten.'</p>
<p>
'Okay...'</p>
<p>
'What?'</p>
<p>
'It... it will be quick, yes? Before he wakes up?'</p>
<p>
'Sure. Oh, sure; yeah. He won't ever know. Won't feel a thing.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
... And so he awoke in the cold snow, roused by the freezing blast
inside him coming to the surface, piercing his skin at every pore,
shrieking out.</p>
<p>
He woke, and knew he was dying. The blizzard had already numbed one
side of his face. One hand was stuck to the hard-packed snow beneath
him. He was still in the standard-issue hospital pyjamas. The cold
was not cold; it was a stunning sort of pain, eating into him from
every direction.</p>
<p>
He raised his head, looking around. A few flat metres of snow, in
what might have been morning light. The blizzard a little quieter
than it had been, but still fierce. The last temperature he'd heard
quoted had been ten below, but with the wind-chill, it was much, much
worse than that. His head and hands and feet and genitals all ached.</p>
<p>
The cold had woken him. It must have. It must have woken him quickly
or he would already be dead. They must just have left him. If he
could find which way they'd gone, follow them...</p>
<p>
He tried to move, but could not. He screamed inside, to produce the
most awesome surge of will he had ever attempted... and succeeded
only in rolling over, and sitting up.</p>
<p>
The effort of it was almost too much; he had to put his hands behind
him to steady himself. He felt them both freeze there. He knew he
would never stand up.</p>
<p>
Talibe... he thought, but the blizzard swept that away in an instant.</p>
<p>
Forget Talibe. You're dying. There are more important things.</p>
<p>
He stared into the milky depths of the blizzard as it swept towards
and past him, like tiny soft stars all packed and hurrying. His face
felt pierced by a million tiny hot needles, but then started to go
numb.</p>
<p>
To have come all this way, he thought, just to die in somebody
else's war. How silly it all seemed now. Zakalwe, Eleth-iomel,
Staberinde; Livueta, Darckense. The names reeled off, were blown away
by the sapping cold of the howling wind. He felt his face shrivel,
felt the cold burrow through skin and eyeballs to his tongue and
teeth and bones.</p>
<p>
He ripped one hand away from the snow behind him; the cold already
anaesthetising the flayed palm. He opened the jacket of the pyjamas,
tore off buttons, and exposed the puckered little mark on his chest
over his heart to the cold blast. He put his hand on the ice behind
him, and tipped his head up. The bones in his neck seemed to grate,
clicking as his head moved, as though the cold was seizing up his
joints. 'Darckense...' he whispered to the boiling chill of the
blizzard.</p>
<p>
He saw the woman walking calmly towards him through the storm.</p>
<p>
She walked on the surface of the hard-packed snow, dressed in long
black boots and a long coat with a furry black collar and cuffs, and
she wore a small hat.</p>
<p>
Her neck and face were exposed, as were her gloveless hands. She had
a long, oval face, and deep dark eyes. She walked easily up to him,
and the storm behind her seemed to part at her back, and he felt
himself in the lee of something more than just her tall body, and
something like warmth seemed to seep through his skin, wherever it
faced her.</p>
<p>
He closed his eyes. He shook his head, which hurt a little, but he
did it all the same. He opened his eyes again.</p>
<p>
She was still there.</p>
<p>
She had half knelt in front of him, her hands folded on one skirted
knee, her face level with his. He peered forward, wrenched one hand
free from the snow again (it was numb, but when he brought the hand
round, he saw the raw flesh he'd torn from the snow). He tried to
touch her face, but she took his hand in one of hers. She was warm.
He thought he had never felt such glorious warmth in all his life.</p>
<p>
He laughed, as she held his hand and the storm parted round her and
her breath clouded the air.</p>
<p>
'Goddamn,' he said. He knew he sounded groggy with the cold and with
the drug. 'An atheist my entire fucking life, and it turns out the
credulous assholes were right all along!' He wheezed, coughed. 'Or do
you surprise them too by <I>not</I> turning up?'</p>
<p>
'You flatter me, Mr Zakalwe,' the woman said, in a superbly deep and
sexy voice. 'I am not Death, or some imagined Goddess. I am as real
as you...' She stroked his torn, bleeding palm with one long, strong
thumb. 'If a little warmer.'</p>
<p>
'Oh, I'm sure you're real,' he said. 'I can feel you're rea...'</p>
<p>
His voice faded; he looked behind the woman. There was a huge shape
appearing inside the whirling snow. Grey-white like the snow, but a
single shade darker, it floated up behind the woman, quiet and huge
and steady. The storm seemed to die, just around them.</p>
<p>
'That's called a twelve person module, Cheradenine,' the woman said.
'It's come to take you away, if you want to be taken away; to the
mainland, if you like. Or further afield, away with us if you'd
prefer that.'</p>
<p>
He was tired of blinking and shaking his head. Whatever insane part
of his mind wanted to play this bizarre game out would just have to
be humoured for as long as it took. What it had to do with the
Staberinde and the Chair, he couldn't tell yet, but if that was what
it was all about - and what else could it be about? - then there was
still no point, in this weakened, dying state, trying to fight it.
Let it happen. He had no real choice. 'With you?' he said, trying not
to laugh.</p>
<p>
'With us. We'd like to offer you a job.' She smiled. 'But let's talk
somewhere a little warmer, shall we?'</p>
<p>
'Warmer?'</p>
<p>
She made a single tossing motion with her head. 'The module.'</p>
<p>
'Oh; yeah,' he agreed. 'That.' He tried to pull his other hand away
from the packed snow behind, failed.</p>
<p>
He looked back at her; she had taken a small flask from her pocket.
She reached round behind him, slowly poured the flask's contents over
his hand. It warmed, and came away steaming gently.</p>
<p>
'Okay?' she said, taking his hand, gently helping him up. She pulled
some slippers from her pocket. 'Here.'</p>
<p>
'Oh.' He laughed. 'Yeah; thanks.'</p>
<p>
She put her arm under one of his, her hand under his other shoulder.
She was strong. 'You seem to know my name,' he said. 'What's yours,
if that isn't an impertinent question?'</p>
<p>
She smiled as they walked through the few flakes of gently falling
snow, towards the slab-sided bulk of the thing she'd called a module.
It had got so quiet - despite the snow nearby, streaking past - that
he could hear their feet making the snow creak.</p>
<p>
'My name,' she said. 'Is Rasd-Coduresa Diziet Embless Sma da'
Marenhide.'</p>
<p>
'No kidding!'</p>
<p>
'But you may call me Diziet.'</p>
<p>
He laughed. 'Yeah; right. Diziet.'</p>
<p>
She walked, he stumbled, into the orange warmth of the module
interior. The walls looked like highly polished wood, the seats like
burnished hide, the floor like a fur rug. It all smelled like a
mountain garden.</p>
<p>
He tried to fill his lungs with the warm, fragrant air. He swayed and
turned, stunned, to the woman.</p>
<p>
'This is <I>real</I>!' he breathed.</p>
<p>
With enough breath, he might have screamed it.</p>
<p>
The woman nodded. 'Welcome aboard, Cheradenine Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
He fainted.</p>
<p>

<p>
He stood in the long gallery and faced into the light. The tall white
curtains billowed softly around him, quiet in the warm breeze. His
long black hair was lifted only slightly by the gentle wind. His
hands were clasped behind his back. He looked pensive. The silent,
lightly clouded skies over the mountains, beyond the fortress and the
city, threw a blank, pervasive light across his face, and standing
there like that, in plain dark clothes, he looked somehow
insubstantial, like some statue, or a dead man propped against the
battlements to fool the foe.</p>
<p>
Somebody spoke his name.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Zakalwe. Cheradenine?'</p>
<p>
'Whaa...?' He came to. He looked into the face of an old man who
looked vaguely familiar. 'Beychae?' he heard himself say. Of course;
the old man was Tsoldrin Beychae. Older-looking than he remembered.</p>
<p>
He looked around, listening. He heard a hum and saw a small, bare
cabin. Seaship? Spaceship?</p>
<p>
<I>Osom Emananish</I>, a voice from his memory told him. Spaceship;
clipper, bound for... somewhere near Impren (whatever and wherever
that was). Impren Habitats. He had to get Tsoldrin Beychae to the
Impren Habitats. Then he remembered the little doctor and his
wonderful field machine with the cutting blue disc. Digging deeper,
in a way that would not have been possible without the Culture's
training and subtle changes, he found the little running loop of
memory that took over from what his brain had already stored. The
room with the fibre optics; blowing a kiss because it was just what
he'd wanted; the explosion, sailing across the bar into the lounge;
crashing, hitting his head. The rest was very vague; distant screams,
and being picked up and carried. Nothing sensible from the voices
he'd registered while he'd been unconscious.</p>
<p>
He lay for a moment, listening to what his body was telling him. No
concussion. Slight damage to his right kidney, lots of bruises,
abrasions on both knees, cuts on right hand... nose still mending.</p>
<p>
He raised himself up, looked again at the cabin; bare metal walls,
two bunks, one small stool Beychae was sitting on. 'This the brig?'</p>
<p>
Beychae nodded. 'Yes; the prison.'</p>
<p>
He lay back. He noticed he was wearing a disposable crew jumpsuit.
The terminal bead had gone from his ear, and the lobe was raw and
sore enough to make him suspect the transceiver hadn't relinquished
its grip there without a struggle. 'You too, or just me?' he asked.</p>
<p>
'Just you.'</p>
<p>
'What about the ship?'</p>
<p>
'I believe we are heading for the nearest stellar system, on the
vessel's back-up drive.'</p>
<p>
'What's the nearest system?'</p>
<p>
'Well, the one inhabited planet is called Murssay. There's a war
going on in part of it; one of those brush-fire conflicts you
mentioned. Apparently the ship may not be allowed to land.'</p>
<p>
'Land?' He grunted, feeling the back of his head. Largish bruise.
'This ship can't land; it's not built for in-atmosphere stuff.'</p>
<p>
'Oh,' Tsoldrin said. 'Well, perhaps they meant we wouldn't be able to
go down to the surface.'</p>
<p>
'Hmm. Must have some sort of orbiter; a space station, yes?'</p>
<p>
Beychae shrugged. 'I suppose so.'</p>
<p>
He looked round the cabin, making it obvious he was looking for
something, 'What do they know about you?' He gestured round the cabin
with his eyes.</p>
<p>
Beychae smiled. 'They know who I am; I've talked to the captain,
Cheradenine. They did receive an order from the shipping company to
turn back, though they didn't know why. Now they know why. The
captain had the choice of waiting for Humanist naval units to pick us
up, or heading for Murssay, and he chose the latter - despite some
pressure, I believe - from Governance, via the shipping company.
Apparently he insisted that the distress channel was used when he
informed the shipping line of both what had happened to the ship, and
who I was.'</p>
<p>
'So now everybody knows?'</p>
<p>
'Yes. I imagine by now the whole Cluster knows exactly who both of us
are. But the point is that I think the captain might not be entirely
unsympathetic to our cause.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah, but what happens when we get to Murssay?'</p>
<p>
'Looks like we get rid of you, Mr Zakalwe.' said a voice from a
speaker overhead.</p>
<p>
He looked at Beychae. 'I hope you heard that too.'</p>
<p>
'I believe that might be the captain,' Beychae said.</p>
<p>
'It is,' said the man's voice, 'And we just got informed that we part
company before we even get to Murssay station.' The man sounded
peeved.</p>
<p>
'Really, captain?'</p>
<p>
'Yes, really, Mr Zakalwe; I have just received a military
communication from the Balzeit Hegemonarchy of Murssay. They want to
uplift you and Mr Beychae before we connect with the Station. As
they're threatening to attack us if we don't comply, I intend to do
as they ask; technically under protest, but frankly it will be a
relief to be rid of you. I may add that the vessel they intend to
take you off with must be a couple of centuries old, and was not
thought to be space-worthy until now. <I>If</I> it survives to make
the rendezvous in a couple of hours, you ought to have an eventful
journey through Murssay's atmosphere. Mr Beychae; I believe if you
reasoned with the Balzeit people they might let you continue with us
to Murssay Station. Whatever you decide, sir, let me wish <I>you</I>
a safe trip.'</p>
<p>
Beychae sat back on the small stool. 'Balzeit,' he said, nodding
thoughtfully. 'I wonder why they want us?'</p>
<p>
'They want <I>you</I>, Tsoldrin,' he said, swinging his feet off the
bed. He looked uncertain. 'They on the good-guys's side? There's so
damn many of these little wars...'</p>
<p>
'Well, in theory they are,' Beychae said. 'I think they believe
planets and machines can have souls.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah, I thought they were,' he said, getting slowly to his feet. He
flexed his arms, moved his shoulders. 'If this Murssay Station is
neutral territory, you'd be better going there, though I'd guess this
Balzeit gang want you, not me.'</p>
<p>
He rubbed the back of his head again, trying to remember what the
situation was on Murssay. Murssay was just the sort of place that
could start a full-scale war. There was, in effect, a
Consolidationist-Humanist war taking place between relatively archaic
military forces on Murssay; Balzeit was on the consolidationist side,
even though the high command was some sort of priesthood. Why they
wanted Beychae, he wasn't sure, though he vaguely recalled that the
priests were into hero-worship in a fairly serious way. Though,
having heard that Beychae was nearby, maybe they just wanted to hold
him to ransom.</p>
<p>
Six hours later they rendezvoused with the ancient Balzeit
spacecraft.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'They want <I>me</I>?' he said.</p>
<p>
They stood by the airlock; him, Beychae, the <I>Osom Emananish's</I>
captain, and four suited figures with guns. The suited men wore
visored helmets, their pale brown faces visible inside, foreheads
marked with a blue circle. The circles actually seemed to glow, he
thought, and he wondered if they were there because of some generous
religious principle, to help snipers.</p>
<p>
'Yes, Mr Zakalwe,' the captain said. He was a rotund little man with
a shaved head. He smiled. 'They want you, not Mr Beychae.'</p>
<p>
He looked at the four armed men. 'What are they up to?' he asked
Beychae.</p>
<p>
'I have no idea,' Beychae admitted.</p>
<p>
He waved his hands out, appealing to the four men. 'Why do you want
<I>me</I>?'</p>
<p>
'Please come with us, sir,' one of the suited men said, via a suit
speaker, in what was obviously not his first language.</p>
<p>
'&quot;Please&quot;?' he said. 'You mean I have a choice?'</p>
<p>
The man looked uncomfortable in his suit. He talked for a while
without any noise coming from the speaker, then said, 'Sir Zakalwe,
is very important you come. You must. Is very important.'</p>
<p>
He shook his head. 'I must,' he repeated seemingly to himself. He
turned to the captain. 'Captain, sir; could I have my earring back,
please?'</p>
<p>
'No,' the captain said, with a beatific grin. 'Now, get off my ship.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The craft was cramped and very low tech and the air was warm and
smelled of electrics. They gave him an old suit to put on and he was
shown to a couch, and belted in. It was a bad sign when they made you
put a suit on <I>inside</I> a ship. The troopers who'd taken him from
the clipper sat behind him. The three-man crew - also suited up -
seemed suspiciously busy, and he had the disquieting impression that
the manual controls in front of them were not just for emergencies.</p>
<p>
The craft re-entered the atmosphere spectacularly; buffeted,
creaking, surrounded by gas glowing bright (seen through, he realised
with a gut-wrenching shock, windows; crystal or glass, not screens),
and with a gradually increasing howl. The air got even warmer.
Flashing lights, hurried chatter between the crew, and some hurried
movements and more excited talk, did not make him feel any happier.
The glow disappeared and the sky turned from violet to blue; the
buffeting returned.</p>
<p>
They swept into the night, and plunged into cloud. The flashing
lights all over the control panels looked even more worrying in
darkness.</p>
<p>
It was a rolling landing on some sort of runway, in a thunderstorm.
The four troopers who'd boarded the <I>Osom Emananish</I> cheered
weakly from behind him as the landing gear - wheels, he supposed -
touched down. The craft trundled on for a worryingly long time,
slewing twice.</p>
<p>
When they finally rolled to a stop, the three crewmen all sat back
slumped in their seats, arms dangling over the edges, silent and
staring out into the rain-filled night.</p>
<p>
He undid the belts, took off the helmet. The troopers opened the
interior airlock.</p>
<p>
When they opened the outer door, it was to reveal rain and lights and
trucks and tanks and some low buildings in the background, and a
couple of hundred people, some in military uniforms, some in long
robes, rain-slicked, some trying to hold umbrellas over others; all
seemed to have the circular marks on their foreheads. A group of a
dozen or so, all old, robed, white haired, faces spattered with rain,
walked to the bottom of the steps that led from the craft to the
ground.</p>
<p>
'Please, sir,' one of the troopers held out a hand to indicate they
should descend. The white-haired men in the robes gathered in an
arrowhead formation at the foot of the steps.</p>
<p>
He stepped out, stood on the little platform before the stairs. The
rain battered into one side of his head.</p>
<p>
A great shout went up, and the dozen old men at the foot of the steps
each bowed their head and went down on one knee, into the puddles on
the dark and wind-whipped runway. A blast of blue light ripped the
blackness beyond the low buildings, its flickering brilliance
momentarily illuminating hills and mountains in the distance. The
assembled people started to chant. It took him a few moments to work
out what it was, then realised they were yelling, 'Za-kal-we!
Za-kal-we!'</p>
<p>
'Oh oh,' he said to himself. Thunder bellowed in the hills.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Yeah... could you just run that past me again?'</p>
<p>
'Messiah...'</p>
<p>
'I really wish you wouldn't use that word.'</p>
<p>
'Oh! Oh, well, Sir Zakalwe; what do you wish?'</p>
<p>
'Ah... how about,' he gestured with his hands. 'Mister?'</p>
<p>
'Sir Zakalwe, sir; you are pre-ordained! You have been beseen!' The
high priest, sitting across the railway carriage, clenched his hands.</p>
<p>
'&quot;Be-seen&quot;?'</p>
<p>
'Indeed! You are our salvation; our divine recompense! You have been
sent!'</p>
<p>
'Sent,' he repeated, still trying to come to terms with what had
happened to him.</p>
<p>
They'd switched the floodlights off shortly after he'd set foot on
the ground. The priests enveloped him, took him, many arms round his
shoulders, from the concrete apron to an armoured truck; the lights
went out on the runway and they were left with the slit-light from
the truck and tank-lights; cones made fans by blinkers clipped over
the lights. He was bustled away down a track to a railway station
where they transferred to a shuttered carriage that clattered into
the night.</p>
<p>
There were no windows.</p>
<p>
'Why yes! Our faith has a tradition of finding outside influences,
because they are always greater.' The high priest - Napoerea, he'd
said his name was - made a bowing motion. 'And what can be greater
than the man who was ComMil?'</p>
<p>
ComMil; he had to dredge his memory for that one. ComMil; that was
what he had been, according to the Cluster's media; director of
military operations when he and Tsoldrin Beychae had been involved in
the whole crazy dance the last time. Beychae had been ComPol, in
charge of politics (ah, these fine divisions!).</p>
<p>
'ComMil...' He nodded, not really much the wiser. 'And you think I
can help you?'</p>
<p>
'Sir Zakalwe!' the high priest said, shifting down from his seat to
kneel on the floor again. 'You are what we believe in!'</p>
<p>
He sat back in the upholstered cushions. 'May I ask why?'</p>
<p>
'Sir; your deeds are legend! Forever since the last unpleasantness!
Our Guider, before he died, prophesied that our salvation would come
from &quot;<I>beyond the skies</I>&quot;, and your name was one of
those mentioned; so coming to us in our hour of need, you must be our
salvation!'</p>
<p>
'I see,' he said, seeing nothing. 'Well, we'll see what we can do.'</p>
<p>
'Messiah!'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The train drew up in a station somewhere; they were escorted from it
to an elevator, then to a suite of rooms that he was told looked out
over the city beneath but it was all in black-out. The internal
screens were closed. The rooms themselves were quite opulent. He
inspected them.</p>
<p>
'Yes. Very nice. Thank you.'</p>
<p>
'And here are your boys,' the high priest said, sweeping aside a
curtain in the bedroom to reveal a languorously displayed half-dozen
or so young men lying on a very large bed.</p>
<p>
'Well... I, uh... Thank you,' he said, nodding to the high priest. He
smiled at the boys, who all smiled back.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He lay awake in the ceremonial bed in the palace, hands behind his
neck. After a while, in the darkness, there was a distinct 'pop', and
in a disappearing blue sphere of light there was a tiny machine about
the size of a human thumb.</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe?'</p>
<p>
'Hi, Sma.'</p>
<p>
'Listen...'</p>
<p>
'No. You listen; I would really like to know what the fuck is going
on here.'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe,' Sma said, through the scout missile. 'It's complicated,
but...'</p>
<p>
'But I'm in here with a gang of homosexual priests who think I'm
going to solve all their military problems.'</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine,' Sma said, in her winning voice. 'These people have
successfully incorporated a belief in your martial prowess into their
religion; how can you deny them?'</p>
<p>
'Believe me; it would be easy.'</p>
<p>
'Like it or not, Cheradenine, you've become a legend to these people.
They think you can do things.'</p>
<p>
'So what am I supposed to do?'</p>
<p>
'Guide them. Be their General.'</p>
<p>
'That's what they expect me to be, I think. But what should I really
do?'</p>
<p>
'Just that,' Sma's voice said. 'Lead them. Meanwhile Beychae's in the
Station; Murssay Station. That counts as neutral territory for now,
and he's making the right noises. Don't you see, Zakalwe?' Sma's
voice sounded tense, exultant. 'We've got them! Beychae's doing just
what we wanted, and all you have to do is...'</p>
<p>
'What?'</p>
<p>
'... Just be yourself; operate for these guys!'</p>
<p>
He shook his head. 'Sma; spell it out for me. What am I supposed to
do?'</p>
<p>
He heard Sma sigh. 'Win their war, Zakalwe. We're putting our weight
behind the forces you're working with. Maybe if they can win this,
and Beychae gets behind the winning side here, we can - perhaps -
swing the Cluster.' He heard her take another deep breath. 'Zakalwe;
we need this. To a degree, our hands are tied, but we need you to
make the whole thing settle out. Win their war for them, and we might
just be able to get it all together. Seriously.'</p>
<p>
'Fine, seriously,' he said to the scout missile. 'But I've already
had a quick look at their maps, and these guys are in deep shit. If
they're going to win this war they're going to need a real miracle.'</p>
<p>
'Just try, Cheradenine. Please.'</p>
<p>
'Do I get any help?'</p>
<p>
'Um... how do you mean?'</p>
<p>
'Intelligence, Sma; if you could keep an eye on what the enemy's -'</p>
<p>
'Ah, no, Cheradenine, I'm sorry we can't.'</p>
<p>
'What?' he said loudly, sitting up in the bed.</p>
<p>
'I'm sorry, Zakalwe; really I am, but we've had to agree to that.
This is a really delicate deal here, and we're having to keep
strictly out of it. This missile shouldn't even be here; and it'll
have to leave soon.'</p>
<p>
'So I'm on my own?'</p>
<p>
'I'm sorry,' Sma said.</p>
<p>
'<I>You're</I> sorry!' he said, collapsing back dramatically on the
bed.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
No soldiering, he recalled Sma saying, some time ago now. 'No fucking
soldiering,' he muttered to himself as he gathered his hair at the
nape of his neck and pulled the little hide band over it. It was
dawn; he patted the pony-tail and looked out through thick,
distorting glass to the mist-shrouded city, just starting to wake to
the dawn-rouged mountain peaks and the blue-glowing skies above. He
looked with distaste at the over-ornamented long robes the priests
expected him to wear, then reluctantly put them on.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The Hegemonarchy and its opponents, the Glaseen Empire, had been
fighting, on and off, for control of their modestly-sized
sub-continent for six hundred years before the rest of the Cluster
came calling in its strange floating sky-ships, a century ago. They'd
been backward even then, compared to the other societies on Murssay,
which were decades ahead in technology, and - arguably - several
centuries ahead morally and politically. Before they'd been
contacted, the natives had the crossbow and the muzzle-loading
cannon. Now, a century later, they had tanks. Lots of tanks. Tanks
and artillery and trucks and a few very inefficient aircraft. Each
side also had one prestige system, partially bought from but mostly
just donated by some of the Cluster's more advanced societies. The
Hegemonarchy had its single sixth- or seventh-hand spacecraft; the
Empire had a clutch of missiles which were generally reckoned to be
inoperable, and probably were politically unusable anyway because
they were supposed to be nuclear-tipped. Public opinion in the
Cluster could tolerate the technologically enhanced continuation of a
pointless war so long as men, women and children died in relatively
small, regular batches, but the thought of a million or so being
incinerated at once, nuked in a city, was not to be tolerated.</p>
<p>
The Empire was winning a conventional war, then, being waged across
two impoverished countries which left to themselves would probably
just be harnessing steam power. Instead refugee peasants filled the
roads, carts loaded with whole households swayed between hedgerows,
while the tanks ploughed the crop fields and the droning planes
dropping bombs took care of slum-clearance.</p>
<p>
The Hegemonarchy was retreating across the plains and into the
mountains as its beleaguered forces fell back before the Empire's
motorised cavalry.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He went straight to the map room after dressing; a few dozy general
staff officers jumped to attention and rubbed sleep from their eyes.
The maps didn't look any better in the morning than they had the
previous evening, but he stood looking at them for a long time,
sizing up the positions of their forces and the Empire's, asking the
officers questions and trying to gauge how accurate their
intelligence was and what level their own troops' morale was at.</p>
<p>
The officers seemed to know more about the disposition of their
enemy's forces than they did about the feelings of their own men.</p>
<p>
He nodded to himself, scanned all the maps, then left for breakfast
with Napoerea and the rest of the priests. He dragged them all back
down into the map room afterwards - they would normally have returned
to their own apartments for contemplation - and asked even more
questions.</p>
<p>
'And I want a uniform like these guys,' he said, pointing at one of
the junior regular army officers in the map room.</p>
<p>
'But, Sir Zakalwe,' Napoerea said, looking worried. 'Those would
demean you!'</p>
<p>
'And these will slow me down,' he said, indicating the long, heavy
robes he was wearing. 'I want to take a look at the front myself.'</p>
<p>
'But, sir, this is the holy citadel; all our intelligence comes here,
all our people's prayers are directed here.'</p>
<p>
'Napoerea,' he said, putting his hand on the other man's shoulder. 'I
know; but I need to see things for myself. I only just got here,
remember?' He looked round the unhappy faces of the other high
priests. 'I'm sure your ways work when circumstances are as they have
been in the past,' he told them, straight-faced. 'But I'm new, and so
I have to use new ways to discover what you probably already know.'
He turned back to Napoerea. 'I want my own plane; a modified
reconnaissance aircraft should do. Two fighters as an escort.'</p>
<p>
The priests had thought it the height of daring unorthodoxy to
venture out to the space port, thirty kilometres away, by train and
truck; they thought he was mad to want to start flying all over the
sub-continent.</p>
<p>
It was what he did for the next few days, however. There was a lull
of sorts in the fighting just at that point - as the Hegemonarchy's
forces fled and the Empire's consolidated - which made his task a
little easier. He wore a plain uniform, without even the half-dozen
or so medal ribbons that even the most junior officer seemed to
warrant just for existing. He spoke to the mostly dull, demoralised
and thoroughly hidebound field generals and colonels, to their
staff, and to the foot soldiers and tank crews, as well as to the
cooks and the supply teams and the orderlies and doctors. Most of the
time he needed an interpreter; only the top brass spoke the Cluster's
common tongue, but even so he suspected the troops felt closer to
somebody who spoke a different language but asked them questions than
they did to somebody who shared their language and only ever used it
to give orders.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He toured every major air field in the course of that first week,
sounding out the Air Force staff for their feelings and opinions.
About the only person he tended to ignore on such occasions was the
always watchful priest every squadron, regiment and fort had as its
titular head. The first few of these priests he'd encountered had had
nothing useful to say, and none of those he saw subsequently ever
seemed to have anything interesting to add beyond the ritualised
initial greetings. He had decided within the first couple of days
that the main problem the priests had was themselves.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Shenastri Province!' Napoerea exclaimed. 'But there are a dozen
important religious sites there! More! And you propose to surrender
without a fight?'</p>
<p>
'You'll get the temples back once we've won the war, and probably
lots of new treasure to put inside them. They're going to fall
whether we try to hold there or not, and they'll probably be damaged
if not destroyed in the fighting. This way, they'll survive intact.
And it stretches their supply lines like crazy. Look; the rains start
in, what? A month? By the time we're ready to counter-attack, they'll
have even worse supply problems; the wet lands behind them mean they
can't bring stuff that way, and they can't retreat there once we do
attack. Nappy; old son; this is beautiful, believe me. If I was a
commander on the other side and I saw this area being offered, I
wouldn't go within a million klicks of it, but the Imperial Army boys
are going to have to because the Court won't let them do anything
else. But they'll know it's a trap. Terrible for the morale.'</p>
<p>
'I don't know, I don't know...' Napoerea shook his head, both his
hands at his mouth, massaging his lower lip while he looked worriedly
at the map.</p>
<p>
(No, you don't know, he thought to himself, watching the man's
nervous body-language. You lot haven't known anything very useful for
generations, chum.) 'It must be done,' he said. 'The withdrawal
should start today.' He turned to another map. 'Aircraft; stop the
bombing and strafing of the roads. Give the pilots two days' rest,
then raid the oil refineries, here.' He pointed. 'A mass raid; use
everything with the range that'll fly.'</p>
<p>
'But if we stop attacking the roads...'</p>
<p>
'They'll fill with even more refugees,' he told the man. 'That'll
slow the Imperial Army down more than our planes. I <I>do</I> want
some of these bridges taken out.' He tapped a couple of river
crossings. He looked mystified at Napoerea. 'You guys sign some sort
of agreement not to bomb bridges or something?'</p>
<p>
'It has always been felt that destroying bridges would hinder a
counter-attack, as well as being... wasteful,' the priest said,
unhappily.</p>
<p>
'Well, these three have to go, anyway.' He tapped the surface of the
map. 'That and the refinery raid should put some sand in their
fuel-lines,' he said, clapping his hands together and rubbing them.</p>
<p>
'But we believe the Imperial Army has great reserves of fuel,'
Napoerea said, looking very unhappy.</p>
<p>
'Even if they have,' he told the high-priest, 'Commanders will move
more cautiously knowing supplies have been interrupted; they're
careful guys. But I bet they never did have the supplies you thought;
they probably think you have bigger supplies than you do, and with
the advance they've had to fund recently... believe me; they may
panic a little if the refinery raid comes off the way I hope it
will.'</p>
<p>
Napoerea looked downcast, rubbed his chin while he gazed forlornly at
the maps. 'It all sounds very...' he began.'... very... <I>adventurous</I>.'</p>
<p>
The high-priest invested the word with a degree of loathing and
contempt that might have been amusing in other circumstances.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Under great protest, the high priests were persuaded they must give
up their precious province and its many important religious sites to
the enemy; they agreed to the mass raid on the refinery.</p>
<p>
He visited the retreating soldiers and the main airfields that would
take part in the refinery raid. Then he took a couple of days
travelling the mountains by truck, inspecting the defences. There was
a valley with a dam at its head that might also provide an effective
trap if the Imperial Army made it that far (he remembered the
concrete island, the snivelling girl and the chair). While he was
driven along the rough roads between the hill forts, he saw a hundred
or more aircraft drone overhead, heading out across the still
peaceful looking plains, their wings loaded with bombs.</p>
<p>
The refinery raid was expensive; almost a quarter of the planes never
came back. But the Imperial Army's advance halted a day later. He had
hoped they would keep on coming for a bit - their supplies hadn't
been supplied straight from the refinery, so they could have kept
going for a week or so - but they'd done the sensible thing, and
stopped for the moment.</p>
<p>
He flew to the spaceport, where the lumbering spaceship - it looked
even more dangerous and dilapidated in daylight - was being slowly
patched up and repaired in case it was ever wanted again. He talked
to the technicians, took a look round the ancient device. The ship
had a name, he discovered; the <I>Hegemonarchy Victorious</I>.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'It's called decapitation,' he told the priests. 'The Imperial Court
travels to Willitice Lake at the start of every Second Season; the
high command comes to brief them. We drop the <I>Victorious</I> in on
them, the day the general staff arrive.'</p>
<p>
The priests looked puzzled. 'With what, Sir Zakalwe? A commando
force? The <I>Victorious</I> is only able to hold...'</p>
<p>
'No no,' he said. 'When I say drop it, I mean we bomb them with it.
We put it into space and then bring it back in, down on top of the
Lake Palace. It's a good four hundred tonnes; even travelling at only
ten times the speed of sound it'll hit like a small nuke going off;
we'll get the entire Court and the general staff in one go. We offer
peace to the commoners' parliament immediately. With any luck at all
we cause immense civil disturbance; probably the commoners'
parliament will see this as their chance to grab real power; the army
will want to take up the reigns itself, and may even have to turn
round and fight a civil war. Junior aristos filing competing claims
should complicate the situation nicely.'</p>
<p>
'But,' Napoerea said, 'this means destroying the <I>Victorious</I>,
does it not?' The other priests were shaking their heads.</p>
<p>
'Well, impacting at four or five kilometres a second wouldn't leave
it totally undented, I suspect.'</p>
<p>
'But Zakalwe!' Napoerea roared, doing a reasonable impression of a
small nuclear explosion himself, 'That's absurd! You can't do it! The
<I>Vktorious </I>is a symbol of... it's our hope! All the people look
at our...'</p>
<p>
He smiled, letting the priest ramble on for a little while. He was
fairly certain the priests looked on the <I>Hegemonarchy Victorious</I>
as their escape route if things went badly in the end.</p>
<p>
He waited until Napoerea had almost finished, then said, 'I
understand; but the craft is on its last legs already, gentlemen.
I've talked to the technicians and the pilots; it's a death-trap. It
was more luck than anything else that it got me here safely.' He
paused, watching the men with the blue circles on their foreheads
look wide-eyed at each other. The muttering increased. He wanted to
smile. <I>That</I> had put the fear of god into them. 'I'm sorry, but
this is the one thing the <I>Victorious</I> is good for.' He smiled.
'And it could indeed produce Victory.'</p>
<p>
He left them to mull over the concepts of high-hypersonic
dive-bombing (no, no suicide mission required; the craft's computers
were perfectly capable of taking it up and bringing it straight
down), symbol-trashing (a lot the peasants and factory workers would
care about their piece of high-tech baublery getting junked), and
Decapitation (probably the most worrying idea of the lot for the
high-priests; what if the Empire thought of doing it to them?) He
assured them the Empire would be in no state to retaliate; and when
they offered peace, the priests would hint heavily they had used a
missile of their own, not the spacecraft, and pretend there were more
where that came from. Even though this would not be difficult to
disprove, especially if one of the world's more sophisticated
societies chose to tell the Empire what had really happened, it would
still be <I>worrying</I> for whoever was trying to work out what to
do on the other side. Besides, they could always just get out of the
city). Meanwhile he went to visit more army units.</p>
<p>
The Imperial Army started its advance again, though slower than
before. He had drawn his troops back almost to the foothills of the
mountains, burning the few unharvested fields and razing the towns
behind them. Whenever they abandoned an airfield they planted bombs
under the runways with days-long time delays, and dug plenty of other
holes that looked like they might contain bombs.</p>
<p>
In the foothills he supervised much of the lay-out of their defensive
lines himself, and kept up his visits to airfields, regional
headquarters and operational units. He kept up, too, the pressure on
the high priests at least to consider using the spacecraft for a
decapitation strike.</p>
<p>
He was busy, he realised one day, as he lay down to sleep in an old
castle that had become operational HQ for this section of the front
(the sky had bloomed with light on the tree-lined horizon, and the
air shaken with the sound of a bombardment, just after dusk). Busy
and - he had to admit, as he put the last reports on the floor under
the camp bed, and put the light out and was almost instantly asleep -
happy.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Two weeks, three weeks from his arrival; the little news that came in
from outside seemed to indicate there was an awful lot of nothing
going on. He suspected there was a lot of intense politicking taking
place. Beychae's name was mentioned; he was still on the Murssay
Station, in touch with the various parties. No word of the Culture,
or from it. He wondered if they ever just forgot things; maybe they'd
forget about him, leave him here, struggling forever in the priests'
and the Empire's insane war.</p>
<p>
The defences grew; the Hegemonarchy's soldiers dug and built, but
were mostly not under fire, and the Imperial Army gradually lapped
against the foothills and paused. He had the Air Force harry the
supply lines and the front line units, and pound the nearest
airfields.</p>
<p>
'There are far too many troops stationed here, round the city. The
best troops should be at the front. The attack will come soon, and if
we're to counter-attack successfully - and it could be <I>very</I>
successfully, if they're tempted to go for a knockout; they've
little left in reserve - then we need those elite squads where they
can do some good.'</p>
<p>
'There is the problem of civil unrest,' Napoerea said. He looked old
and tired.</p>
<p>
'Keep a few units here, and keep them in the streets, so people don't
forget they're here, but dammit, Napoerea, most of these guys spend
all their time in barracks. They're needed at the front. I have just
the place for them, look...'</p>
<p>
Actually he wanted to tempt the Imperial Army to go for the
knock-out, and the city was to be the bait. He sent the crack troops
into the mountain passes. The priests looked at how much territory
they'd now lost, and tentatively gave the go-ahead for preparing for
decapitation; the <I>Hegemonarchy Victorious</I> would be readied
for its final flight, though not used unless the situation appeared
genuinely desperate. He promised he would try to win the war
conventionally first.</p>
<p>
The attack came; forty days after he had arrived on Murssay, the
Imperial Army crashed into the foothill forests. The priests began to
panic. He had the Air Force attack the supply lines the majority of
the time, not the front. The defensive lines gradually gave way;
units retreated, bridges were blown. Gradually, as the foothills led
into the mountains, the Imperial Army was concentrated, funnelled
into the valleys. The trick with the dam didn't work this time; the
charges placed under it just didn't go off. He had to move fast to
shift two elite units to cover the pass above that valley.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'But if we leave the city?' The priests looked stunned. Their eyes
looked as empty as the painted blue circle on their foreheads. The
Imperial Army was slowly moving up the valleys, forcing their
soldiers back. He kept telling them things would be all right, but
things just got worse and worse. There was nothing else for them to
do; it all seemed too hopeless, and too late to take things back into
their own hands. Last night, with</p>
<p>
the wind blowing down from the mountains to the city, the sound of
distant artillery had been audible.</p>
<p>
'They'll try to take Balzeit City if they think they can,' he said.
'It's a symbol. Well fine, but it doesn't actually have much military
importance. They'll grab at it. We let just so many through, then we
close the passes; here,' he said, tapping the map. The priests shook
their heads.</p>
<p>
'Gents, we are not in disarray! We are falling back. But they are in
much worse shape than we are, taking far heavier casualties; each
metre is costing them blood. And, all the time, their supply lines
get longer. We must take them to the point where they start to think
about pulling back, then present them with the possibility - the
seeming possibility - of a knock-out blow. But it won't knock us out;
it knocks them out.' He looked round them. 'Believe me; it'll work.
You may have to leave the citadel for a while, but when you return, I
guarantee it will be in triumph.'</p>
<p>
They did not look convinced, but - possibly because they were just
too stunned to fight - they let him have his way.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
It took a few days, while the Imperial Army struggled up the valleys,
and the Hegemonarchy's forces resisted, retreated, resisted,
retreated, but eventually - watching for signs that the Imperial
soldiers were tiring, and the tanks and trucks not always moving when
they might have wanted to, starved of fuel - he decided that were he
on the other side, he'd be thinking about halting the advance. That
night, in the pass which led down to the city, most of the
Hegemonarchy troops left their positions. In the morning the battle
resumed, and the Hegemonarchy's men suddenly retreated, shortly
before they would have been over-run. A puzzled, excited but still
exhausted and worried General in the Imperial High Command watched
through field glasses as a distant convoy of trucks crawled away down
the pass towards the city, occasionally strafed by Imperial
aircraft. Reconnaissance suggested the infidel priests were making
preparations to leave their citadel. Spies indicated that their
spacecraft was being readied for some special mission.</p>
<p>
The General radioed the Court High Command. The order to advance on
the city was given the following day.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He watched the terminally worried-looking priests leave from the
train station under the citadel. In the end he had to dissuade them
from ordering the decapitation attack. Let me try this first, he'd
told them.</p>
<p>
They could not understand each other.</p>
<p>
The priests looked at the territory they had lost, and the fraction
they had left, and thought it was all over for them. He looked at his
relatively unscathed divisions, his fresh units, his crack squads,
all positioned just where they should be, knives laid against and
inside the body of an over-extended, worn-out enemy, just ready to
cut... and thought it was all over for the Empire.</p>
<p>
The train pulled out, and - unable to resist - he waved cheerily. The
high priests would be better out of the way, in one of their great
monasteries in the next mountain range. He ran back upstairs to the
map room, to see how things were going.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He waited until a couple of divisions had made it through the pass,
then had the units that had held it - and mostly retreated into the
forests around the pass, not gone down the pass at all - take it
again. The city and the citadel were bombed, though not well; the
Hegemonarchy's fighters shot most of the bombers down. The
counter-attack finally began. He started with the elite troops, then
brought in the rest. The Air Force still concentrated on the supply
lines for the first couple of days, then switched to the front line.
The Imperial Army wavered, line crinkling; it seemed to hesitate like
some wash of water almost but not quite capable of overspilling the
damming line of mountains save in one place (and that trickle was
drying, still pushing for the city, leaving the pass, fighting
through the forests and fields for the shining goal they still hoped
might win the war...), then the line fell back; the soldiers too
exhausted, their supplies of ammunition and fuel too sporadic.</p>
<p>
The passes stayed with the Hegemonarchy, and slowly they pushed down
from them again, so that it must have seemed to the Imperial soldiers
that they were forever shooting up-hill, and that while advancing had
been a heavy, dangerous slog, retreating was only too easy.</p>
<p>
The retreat became a rout in valley after valley. He insisted on
keeping the counter-attack going; the priests cabled that more forces
ought to be deployed to stop the advance of the two Imperial
divisions on the capital. He ignored them. There was barely enough
left of the two tattered divisions to make one whole one, and they
were being gradually eroded further all the time. It was possible
they might make it to the city, but after that they would have
nowhere to go. He thought it might be satisfying to accept their
eventual surrender personally.</p>
<p>
The rains came on the far side of the mountains, and as the
bedraggled Imperial forces made their way through the dripping
forests, their Air Force was all too often grounded by bad weather,
while the Hegemonarchy's planes bombed and strafed then with
impunity.</p>
<p>
People fled to the city; artillery duels thundered nearby. The
remnants of the two divisions that had broken through the mountains
fought desperately on towards their goal. On the distant plains on
the far side of the mountains, the rest of the Imperial Army was
retreating as fast as it could. The divisions trapped in Shenastri
Province, unable to retreat through the quagmire behind them,
surrendered en masse.</p>
<p>
The Imperial Court signalled its desire for peace the day what was
left of its two divisions entered Balzeit City. They had a dozen
tanks and a thousand men, but they left their artillery in the
fields, bereft of ammunition. The few thousand people left in the
city sought refuge in the wide parade grounds of the citadel. He
watched them stream in through the gates in the high walls, far in
the distance.</p>
<p>
He'd been going to quit the citadel that day - the priests had been
screaming at him to do so for days, and most of the general staff had
already left - but now he held the transcript of the message they'd
just received from the Imperial Court.</p>
<p>
Two Hegemonarchy divisions were, anyway, on their way out of the
mountains, coming to the aid of the city.</p>
<p>
He radioed the priests. They decided to accept a truce; fighting
would stop immediately, if the Imperial Army withdrew to the
positions it had held before the war. There were a few more radio
exchanges; he left the priests and the Imperial Court to sort it all
out. He took off his uniform and for the first time since he'd
arrived, dressed as a civilian. He went to a high tower with some
field glasses, and watched the tiny specks that were enemy tanks as
they rolled down a street, far away. The citadel gates were closed.</p>
<p>
A truce was declared at midday. The weary Imperial soldiers outside
the citadel gates billeted themselves in the bars and hotels nearby.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He stood in the long gallery and faced into the light. The tall white
curtains billowed softly around him, quiet in the warm breeze. His
long black hair was lifted only slightly by the gentle wind. His
hands were clasped behind his back. He looked pensive. The silent,
lightly clouded skies over the mountains, beyond the fortress and the
city, threw a blank, pervasive light across his face, and standing
there like that, in plain dark clothes, he looked insubstantial, like
some statue, or a dead man propped against the battlements to fool
the foe.</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe?'</p>
<p>
He turned. His eyes widened in surprise. 'Skaffen-Amtiskaw! This is
an unexpected honour. Sma letting you out alone these days, or is she
about too?' He looked the length of the citadel's long gallery.</p>
<p>
'Good day, Cheradenine,' the drone said, floating towards him. 'Ms
Sma is on her way, in a module.'</p>
<p>
'And how is Dizzy?' He sat down on a small bench set against the wall
which faced the long line of white-curtained windows. 'What's the
news?'</p>
<p>
'I believe it is mostly good,' Skaffen-Amtiskaw said, floating level
with his face. 'Mr Beychae is on his way to the Impren Habitats,
where a summit conference between the Cluster's two main tendencies
is to be held. It would appear the danger of war is lessening.'</p>
<p>
'Well, isn't this all very wonderful,' he said, sitting back with his
hands behind his neck. 'Peace here; peace out there.' He squinted at
the drone, his head to one side. 'And yet, drone, somehow you do not
seem to be overflowing with joy and happiness. You seem - dare I say
it? - positively sombre. What's the matter? Batteries low?'</p>
<p>
The machine was silent for a second or two. Then it said, 'I believe
Ms Sma's module is about to land; shall we go to the roof?'</p>
<p>
He looked puzzled for a moment, then nodded, stooa smartly and
clapped his hands once, indicating the way forward. 'Certainly; let's
go.'</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
They went to his apartments. He thought Sma seemed rather subdued,
too. He'd imagined she'd be bubbling over with excitement because
the Cluster looked like it wasn't going to go to war after all.</p>
<p>
'What's the problem, Dizzy?' he asked, pouring her a drink. She was
pacing up and down in front of the room's shuttered windows. She took
the drink from him, but didn't seem interested in it. She turned to
face him, her long, oval face looking... he wasn't sure. But there
was a cold feeling somewhere in his guts.</p>
<p>
'You have to leave, Cheradenine,' she told him.</p>
<p>
'Leave? When?'</p>
<p>
'Now; tonight. Tomorrow morning at the latest.'</p>
<p>
He looked confused, then laughed. 'Okay; I confess; the catamites
were starting to look attractive, but...'</p>
<p>
'No,' Sma said. 'I'm serious, Cheradenine. You have to go.'</p>
<p>
He shook his head. 'I can't. There's no guarantee the truce will
hold. They might need me.'</p>
<p>
'The truce isn't going to hold,' Sma told him, looking away. 'Not on
one side, anyway.' She put her glass down on a shelf.</p>
<p>
'Eh?' he said. He glanced at the drone, which was looking
non-committal. 'Diziet, what are you talking about?'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe,' she said, eyes blinking rapidly; she tried to look at him,
'A deal's been done; you have to leave.'</p>
<p>
He stared at her.</p>
<p>
'What's the deal, Dizzy?' he said softly.</p>
<p>
'There was some... fairly low-level help being given to the Empire by
the Humanist faction,' she told him, walking towards one wall, then
returning, talking not to him but to the tile and carpet floor. 'They
had... face invested in what's been happening here. The whole
delicate structure of the deal did rather depend on the Empire
triumphing here.' She stopped, glanced at the drone, looking away
again. 'Which is what everybody agreed was going to happen, up until
a few days ago.'</p>
<p>
'So,' he said slowly, putting aside his own drink, sitting down in a
great chair that looked like a throne. 'I messed things up by turning
the game against the Empire, did I?'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' Sma said, swallowing. 'Yes, you did. I'm sorry. And I know
it's crazy, but that's the way things are here, the way the people
are here; the Humanists are divided at the moment, and there are
factions within them that would use any excuse to argue for getting
out of the deal, however insignificant that excuse might be. They
might just be able to pull the whole thing down. We can't take that
risk. The Empire has to win.'</p>
<p>
He sat, looking at a small table in front of him. He sighed. 'I see.
And all I have to do is leave?'</p>
<p>
'Yes; come with us.'</p>
<p>
'What happens after that?'</p>
<p>
'The high priests will be kidnapped by an Imperial commando squad
brought in by Humanist controlled aircraft. The citadel here will be
taken over by the troops outside; there are raids planned on the
field HQs; they should be pretty bloodless. If necessary, the
Hegemonarchy planes, tanks, artillery pieces and trucks will be put
out of action, should the armed forces ignore the call put out by the
high priesthood to surrender their arms. Once they've seen a few
planes and tanks laser-blasted from space, it's expected the fight
will go out of the army.'</p>
<p>
Sma stopped pacing, came to stand in front of him, on the far side of
the little table. 'It all happens at dawn tomorrow. It should be
fairly bloodless, really, Zakalwe. You might as well leave now; it
would be best.' He heard her exhale. 'You've done... brilliantly,
Cheradenine. It's worked; you did it; brought Beychae out, got him...
motivated or whatever. We're grateful. We're very grateful, and it's
not easy...'</p>
<p>
He raised one hand to stop her. He heard her sigh. He looked up from
the small table, up to her face. 'I can't leave right away. There are
a few things I have to do. I'd rather you left now and then came
back. Pick me up tomorrow; at dawn.' He shook his head. 'I won't
desert them until then.'</p>
<p>
Sma opened her mouth, then closed it, glanced at the drone. 'All
right; we'll be back tomorrow. Zakalwe, I -'</p>
<p>
'It's all right, Diziet,' he interrupted calmly, and slowly stood up.
He looked into her eyes; she had to look away. 'It'll be as you say.
Good-bye.' He didn't hold out his hand.</p>
<p>
Sma walked to the door; the drone followed her.</p>
<p>
The woman looked back. He nodded once; she hesitated, seemed to think
the better of saying anything, and went out.</p>
<p>
The drone stopped there too. 'Zakalwe,' it said. 'I just want to add
-'</p>
<p>
'Out!' he screamed, and in one movement turned, swooped, caught the
small table between the legs and threw it with all his might at the
floating machine. The table bounced off an invisible field and
clattered to the floor; the drone swept out and the door closed.</p>
<p>
He stood staring at it for some time.</p>

<p>
He was younger then. The memories were still fresh. He discussed them
with the frozen, seemingly sleeping people sometimes, on his
wanderings through the cold, dark ship, and wondered, in its silence,
if he really was mad.</p>
<p>
The experience of being frozen and of then being woken up had done
nothing to dull his memories; they remained keen and bright. He had
rather hoped that the claims they made for freezing were
over-optimistic, and the brain did indeed lose at least some of its
information; he'd secretly desired that attrition, but been
disappointed. The process of warming and revival was actually rather
less traumatic and confusing than coming round after being knocked
unconscious, something that had happened to him a few times in his
life. Revival was smoother, took longer, and was really quite
pleasant; in truth quite like waking up after a good night's sleep.</p>
<p>
They left him alone for a couple of hours after they'd run the
medical checks and pronounced him fit and well. He sat, wrapped in a
big thick towel, on the bed, and - like somebody probing a diseased
tooth with tongue or finger, unable to stop checking that it really
does hurt every now and again - he called up his memories, going
through the roll-call of those old and recent adversaries he'd hoped
he might have lost somewhere in the darkness and the cold of space.</p>
<p>
All his past was indeed present, and everything that had been wrong
present too, and correct.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The ship was called the <I>Absent Friends;</I> its journey would take
it over a century. It was a mercy voyage, in a way; its services
donated by its alien owners to help assuage the after-effects of a
terrible war. He had not really deserved his place, and had used
false papers and a false name to secure his escape. He'd volunteered
to be woken up near the middle of the journey to provide part of the
human crew because he thought it would be a shame to travel in space
and never really know it, never appreciate it, never look out into
that void. Those who did not choose to do crew duty would be drugged
on planet, taken into space unconscious, frozen out there, and then
wake up on another planet.</p>
<p>
This seemed undignified, to him. To be treated so was to become
cargo.</p>
<p>
The two other people on duty when he was woken were Ky and Erens.
Erens had been supposed to return to the ranks of the frozen people
five years earlier, after a few months of duty on the ship, but had
decided to stay awake until they arrived at their destination. Ky had
been revived three years later and should also have gone back to
sleep, to be replaced after a few months by the next person on the
crew rota, but by then Erens and Ky had started to argue, and neither
wanted to be the first to return to the stasis of the freeze; there
had been stalemate for two and a half years while the great slow ship
moved, quiet and cold, past the distant pinprick lights that were the
stars. Finally they'd woken him up, at last, because he was next on
the rota and they wanted somebody else to talk to. As a rule,
however, he just sat in the crew section and listened to the two of
them argue.</p>
<p>
'There's still <I>fifty years</I> to go,' Ky reminded Erens.</p>
<p>
Eren waved a bottle. 'I can wait. It isn't forever.'</p>
<p>
Ky nodded at the bottle. 'You'll kill yourself with that stuff, and
all the other junk you take. You'll never make it. You'll never see
real sunlight again, or taste rain. You won't last one year let alone
fifty; you should go back to sleep.'</p>
<p>
'It isn't sleep.'</p>
<p>
'You should go back to it, whatever you want to call it; you should
let yourself be frozen again.'</p>
<p>
'And it isn't literally frozen... freezing, either.' Erens looked
annoyed and puzzled at the same time.</p>
<p>
The man they'd woken up wondered how many hundreds of times the two
had been through this argument.</p>
<p>
'You should go back into your little cold cubicle like you were
supposed to, five years ago, and get them to treat you for your
addictions when they revive you,' Ky said.</p>
<p>
'The ship already treats me,' Erens told Ky, with a kind of slow
drunken dignity. 'I am in a state of grace with my enthusiasms;
sublimely tensioned grace.' So saying, Erens tipped the bottle back
and drained it.</p>
<p>
'You'll kill yourself.'</p>
<p>
'It's my life.'</p>
<p>
'You might kill us all; everybody on the whole ship, sleepers too.'</p>
<p>
'The ship looks after itself,' Erens sighed, looking round the Crew
Lounge. It was the only dirty place on the ship. Everywhere else,
the ship's robots tidied, but Erens had worked out how to delete the
Crew Lounge from the craft's memory, and so the place could look good
and scruffy. Erens stretched, kicking a couple of small recyclable
cups off the table.</p>
<p>
'Huh,' Ky said. 'What if you've damaged it with all your messing
around?'</p>
<p>
'I have not been &quot;messing around&quot; with it,' Erens said,
with a small sneer. 'I have altered a few of the more basic
housekeeping programs; it doesn't talk to us anymore, and it lets us
keep this place looking lived-in; that's about it. Nothing that's
going to make the ship wander into a star or start thinking it's
human and what are these intestinal parasites doing in there. But you
wouldn't understand. No technical background. Livu, here; he might
understand, eh?' Erens stretched out further, sliding down the grubby
seat, boots scraping on the filthy surface of the table. 'You
understand, don't you, Darac?'</p>
<p>
'I don't know,' he admitted (he was used to answering to Darac, or Mr
Livu, or just Livu, by now). 'I suppose if you know what you're
doing, there's no real harm.' Erens looked pleased. 'On the other
hand, a lot of disasters have been caused by people who thought they
knew what they were doing.'</p>
<p>
'Amen,' Ky said, looking triumphant, and leant aggressively-towards
Erens. 'See?'</p>
<p>
'As our friend said,' Erens pointed out, reaching for another bottle.
'He doesn't know.'</p>
<p>
'You should go back with the sleepers,' Ky said.</p>
<p>
'They're not sleeping.'</p>
<p>
'You're not supposed to be up right now; there's only supposed to be
two people up at any point.'</p>
<p>
'You go back then.'</p>
<p>
'It isn't my turn. You were up first.'</p>
<p>
He left them to argue.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Sometimes he would put a spacesuit on and go through the airlock into
the storage sections, which were in vacuum. The storage sections made
up most of the ship; over ninety-nine per cent of it. There was a
tiny drive unit at one end of the craft, an even tinier living unit
at the other, and - in between - the bulging bulk of the ship, packed
with the un-dead.</p>
<p>
He walked the cold, dark corridors, looking from side to side at the
sleeper units. They looked like drawers in a filing cabinet; each was
the head-end of something very like a coffin. A little red light
glowed faintly on each one, so that standing in one of the gently
spiralling corridors, with his own suit lights switched off, those
small and steady sparks curved away in a ruby lattice folded over the
darkness, like some infinite corridor of red giant suns set up by
some obsessively tidy-minded god.</p>
<p>
Spiralling gradually upwards, moving away from the living unit at
what he always thought of as the head of the ship, he walked up
through its quiet, dark body. Usually he took the outermost corridor,
just to appreciate the scale of the vessel. As he ascended, the pull
of the ship's fake gravity gradually decreased. Eventually, walking
became a series of skidding leaps in which it was always easier to
hit the ceiling than make any forward progress. There were handles on
the coffin-drawers; he used them once walking became too inefficient,
pulling himself along towards the waist of the ship, which - as he
approached it - turned one wall of coffin-drawers to a floor and the
other to a ceiling, in places. Standing under a radial corridor, he
leapt up, floated towards what was now the ceiling with the radial
corridor a chimney up through it. He caught a coffin-drawer handle,
and used a succession of them as rungs, climbing into the centre of
the ship.</p>
<p>
Running through the centre of the <I>Absent Friends</I> there was an
elevator shaft that extended from living unit to drive unit. In the
very centre of the whole ship, he would summon the elevator, if it
wasn't already waiting there from last time.</p>
<p>
When it came, he would enter it, floating inside the squat,
yellow-lit cylinder. He would take out a pen, or a small torch, and
place it in the centre of the elevator car, and just float there,
watching the pen or torch, waiting to see if he had stationed it so
exactly in the centre of the whole slowly spinning mass of the ship
that it would stay where he'd left it.</p>
<p>
He got very good at doing this, eventually, and could spend hours
sitting there, with the suit lights and the elevator lights on
sometimes (if it was a pen) or off (if it was a torch), watching the
little object, waiting for his own dexterity to prove greater than
his patience, waiting for - in other words, he could admit to himself
- one part of his obsession to win over the other.</p>
<p>
If the pen or torch moved and eventually connected with the walls or
floor or ceiling of the elevator car, or drifted through the open
door, then he had to float, climb (down) and then pull and walk back
the way he had come. If it stayed still in the centre of the car, he
was allowed to take the elevator back to the living unit.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'Come on, Darac,' Erens said, lighting up a pipe. 'What brought you
along on this one-way ride, eh?'</p>
<p>
'I don't want to talk about it.' He turned up the ventilation to get
rid of Eren's drug fumes. They were in the viewing carousel, the one
place in the ship where you could get a direct view of the stars. He
came up here every now and again, opened the shutters and watched the
stars spin slowly overhead. Sometimes he tried to read poetry.</p>
<p>
Erens still visited the carousel alone as well, but Ky no longer did;
Erens reckoned Ky got homesick, seeing the silent nothingness out
there, and the lonely specks that were other suns.</p>
<p>
'Why not?' Erens said.</p>
<p>
He shook his head and sat back in the couch, looking out into the
darkness. 'It isn't any of your business.'</p>
<p>
'I'll tell you why I came along if you tell me why you did,' Erens
grinned, making the words sound childish, conspiratorial.</p>
<p>
'Get lost, Erens.'</p>
<p>
'Mine is an interesting story; you'd be fascinated.'</p>
<p>
'I'm sure,' he sighed.</p>
<p>
'But I won't tell you unless you tell me first. You're missing a lot;
mm-hmm.'</p>
<p>
'Well, I'll just have to live with that,' he said. He turned down the
lighting in the carousel until the brightest thing in it was Erens'
face, glowing red with reflected light on each draw of the pipe. He
shook his head when Erens offered him the drug.</p>
<p>
'You need to loosen up, my friend,' Erens told him, slumping back in
the other seat. 'Get high; share your problems.'</p>
<p>
'What problems?'</p>
<p>
He saw Erens' head shake in the darkness. 'Nobody on this ship hasn't
got problems, friend. Nobody out here not running away from
something.'</p>
<p>
'Ah; ship psychiatrist now are we?'</p>
<p>
'Hey, come on; nobody's going back, are they? Nobody on here's ever
going back home. Half the people we know are probably dead already,
and the ones that aren't will be, by the time we get where we're
going. So if we can't ever see the people we used to know again, and
probably never see home again, it has to be something pretty damn
important and pretty damn bad, pretty damn <I>evil </I>to make a body
up and leave like that. We all <I>got</I> to be running from
something, whether it's something we did or something we had done to
us.'</p>
<p>
'Maybe some people just like travelling.'</p>
<p>
'That's crap; nobody likes travelling that much.'</p>
<p>
He shrugged. 'Whatever.'</p>
<p>
'Aw, Darac, come on; argue, dammit.'</p>
<p>
'I don't believe in argument,' he said, looking out into the darkness
(and saw a towering ship, a capital ship, ringed with its layers and
levels of armament and armour, dark against the dusk light, but not
dead).</p>
<p>
'You don't?' Erens said, genuinely surprised. 'Shit, and I thought I
was the cynical one.'</p>
<p>
'It's not cynicism,' he said flatly. 'I just think people overvalue
argument because they like to hear themselves talk.'</p>
<p>
'Oh well, thank <I>you</I>.'</p>
<p>
'It's comforting, I suppose.' He watched the stars wheel, like
absurdly slow shells seen at night; rising, peaking, falling... (And
reminded himself that the stars too would explode, perhaps, one day.)
'Most people are not prepared to have their minds changed,' he said.
'And I think they know in their hearts that other people are just the
same, and one of the reasons people become angry when they argue is
that they realise just that, as they trot out their excuses.'</p>
<p>
'<I>Excuses</I>, eh? Well, if this ain't cynicism, what is?' Erens
snorted.</p>
<p>
'Yes, excuses,' he said, with what Erens thought might just have been
a trace of bitterness. 'I strongly suspect the things people believe
in are usually just what they instinctively feel is right; the
excuses, the justifications, the things you're supposed to argue
about, come later. They're the least important part of the belief.
That's why you can destroy them, win an argument, prove the other
person wrong, and still they believe what they did in the first
place.' He looked at Erens. 'You've attacked the wrong thing.'</p>
<p>
'So what do you suggest one does, Professor, if one is not to indulge
in this futile... arguing stuff?'</p>
<p>
'Agree to disagree,' he said. 'Or fight.'</p>
<p>
'<I>Fight</I>?'</p>
<p>
He shrugged. 'What else is left?'</p>
<p>
'Negotiate?'</p>
<p>
'Negotiation is a way to come to a conclusion; it's the type of
conclusion that I'm talking about.'</p>
<p>
'Which basically is disagree or fight?'</p>
<p>
'If it comes to it.'</p>
<p>
Erens was silent for a while, drawing on the pipe until its red glow
faded, then saying, 'You have a military background, at all, yeah?'</p>
<p>
He sat and watched the stars. Eventually he turned his head and
looked at Erens. 'I think the war gave us all a military background,
don't you?'</p>
<p>
'Hmm,' Erens said. They both studied the slowly moving star-field.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Twice, in the depths of the sleeping ship, he almost killed somebody.
One of those times, it was somebody else.</p>
<p>
He stopped on the long, spiralling outer corridor, about halfway to
the waist of the ship, where he felt very light on his feet, and his
face was a little flushed with effects of normal blood pressure
working against the reduced pull. He hadn't intended to look at any
of the stored people - the truth was, he never really thought about
them in any but the most abstract way - but suddenly he wanted to see
something more of a sleeper than just a little red light. He stopped
at one of the coffin-drawers.</p>
<p>
He had been shown how to work them after he'd volunteered to act as
crew, and had another, rather perfunctory, run through the procedures
shortly after being revived. He turned the suit lights on, flipped
out the drawer's control pad, and carefully - using one bulky, gloved
finger - keyed in the code that Erens said turned off the ship's
monitoring system. A little blue light came on. The red light stayed
steady; if it flashed the ship knew there was something wrong.</p>
<p>
He unlocked the cabinet, drew the whole device sliding out.</p>
<p>
He looked at the woman's name, printed on a plastic strip stuck to
the head-unit. No-one he knew, anyway, he thought. He opened the
inner cover.</p>
<p>
He looked in at the woman's calm, deathly pale face. His lights
reflected on the crinkled transparent plastic wrapping covering her
like something you'd buy in a shop. Tubes in her nose and mouth,
leading away beneath her. A small screen flashed on above her tied-up
hair, on the head-unit. He looked; she seemed in good shape, for
somebody so nearly completely dead. Her hands were crossed across the
chest of the paper tunic she wore. He looked at her finger-nails,
like Erens had said. Quite long, but he'd seen people grow them
longer.</p>
<p>
He looked at the control pad again, entered another code. Lights
flashed all over the control surface; the red light did not start
flashing, but almost everything else did. He opened a little red and
green door set in the top of the head-unit. Out of it he took a small
sphere of what looked like fine green wires, containing an ice blue
cube. A compartment alongside gave access to a covered switch. He
pushed the cover back, put his finger down to the switch.</p>
<p>
He held the woman's recorded brain patterns, backed-up onto the
little blue cube. Easily crushable. His other hand, finger resting on
the small switch, could turn off her life.</p>
<p>
He wondered if he would do it, and seemed to wait for a while, as if
expecting some part of his own mind to assume control from him. A
couple of times it seemed to him that he felt the start of the
impulse to throw the switch, and could have started to do so just an
instant later, but each time suppressed the urge. He left his finger
there, looked at the small cube inside its protective cage. He
thought how remarkable and at the same time how oddly sad it was that
all of a human mind could be contained in something so small. Then he
reflected that a human brain was not so very much bigger than the
little blue cube, and used resources and techniques far more ancient,
and so was no less impressive (and still as sad).</p>
<p>
He closed the woman up again in her chill sleep, and continued on
his slow-motion walk to the centre of the ship.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
'I don't know any stories.'</p>
<p>
'Everybody knows stories,' Ky told him.</p>
<p>
'I don't. Not proper stories.'</p>
<p>
'What's a &quot;proper&quot; story?' Ky sneered. They sat in the Crew
Lounge, surrounded by their debris.</p>
<p>
He shrugged. 'An interesting one. One people want to listen to.'</p>
<p>
'People want to listen to different things. What one person would
call a proper story might not please somebody else.'</p>
<p>
'Well, I can only go by what I think would be a proper story, and I
don't have any. Not stories that I want to tell, anyway.' He grinned
coldly at Ky.</p>
<p>
'Ah; that's different,' Ky nodded.</p>
<p>
'Indeed it is.'</p>
<p>
'Well, tell me what you believe in, then,' Ky said, leaning towards
him.</p>
<p>
'Why should I?'</p>
<p>
'Why shouldn't you? Tell me because I asked.'</p>
<p>
'No.'</p>
<p>
'Don't be so stand-offish. We're the only three people for billions
of kilometres and the ship's a bore; who else is there to talk to?'</p>
<p>
'Nothing.'</p>
<p>
'Exactly. Nothing and nobody.' Ky looked pleased.</p>
<p>
'No; I meant that's what I believe in; nothing.'</p>
<p>
'At <I>all</I>?'</p>
<p>
He nodded. Ky sat back, thoughtful, nodding. 'They must have hurt you
bad.'</p>
<p>
'Who?'</p>
<p>
'Whoever robbed you of whatever it was you used to believe in.'</p>
<p>
He shook his head slowly. 'Nobody ever robbed me of anything,' he
said. Ky was silent for a while, so he sighed and said, 'So, Ky, what
do you believe in?'</p>
<p>
Ky looked at the blank screen that covered most of one wall of the
lounge. 'Something other than nothing.'</p>
<p>
'Anything with a name is other than nothing,' he said.</p>
<p>
'I believe in what's around us,' Ky said, arms crossed, sitting back
in the seat. 'I believe in what you can see from the carousel, what
we'd see if that screen was on, although what you'd see wouldn't be
the only <I>sort</I> of what I believe in that I believe in.'</p>
<p>
'In a word, Ky,' he said.</p>
<p>
'Emptiness,' Ky said with a flickering, jittery smile. 'I believe in
emptiness.'</p>
<p>
He laughed. 'That's pretty close to nothing.'</p>
<p>
'Not really,' Ky said.</p>
<p>
'Looks it to most of us.'</p>
<p>
'Let me tell you a sort of story.'</p>
<p>
'Must you?'</p>
<p>
'No more than you must listen.'</p>
<p>
'Yeah... okay, then. Anything to pass the time.'</p>
<p>
'The story is this. It's a true story, by the way, not that that
matters. There is a place where the existence or non-existence of
souls is taken very seriously indeed. Many people, whole seminaries,
colleges, universities, cities and even states devote almost all
their time to the contemplation and disputation of this matter and
related topics.</p>
<p>
'About a thousand years ago, a wise philosopher-king who was
considered the wisest man in the world announced that people spent
too much time discussing these things, and could, if the matter was
settled, apply their energies to more practical pursuits which would
benefit everybody. So he would end the argument once and for all.</p>
<p>
'He summoned the wisest men and women from every part of the world,
and of every known persuasion, to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>
'It took many years to assemble every single person who wished to
take part, and the resulting debates, papers, tracts, books,
intrigues and even fights and murders took even longer.</p>
<p>
'The philosopher-king took himself off to the mountains to spend
these years alone, emptying his mind of everything so that he would
be able, he hoped, to come back once the process of argument was
ended and pronounce the final decision.</p>
<p>
'After many years they sent for the king, and when he felt ready he
listened to everyone who thought they had something to say on the
existence of souls. When they had all said their piece, the king went
away to think.</p>
<p>
'After a year, the king announced he had come to his decision. He
said that the answer was not quite so simple as everybody had
thought, and he would publish a book, in several volumes, to explain
the answer. The king set up two publishing houses, and each published
a great and mighty volume. One repeated the sentences, &quot;Souls do
exist. Souls do not exist,&quot; time after time, part after part,
page after page, section after section, chapter after chapter, book
after book. The other repeated the words, &quot;Souls do not exist.
Souls do exist,&quot; in the same fashion. In the language of the
kingdom, I might add, each sentence had the same number of words,
even the same number of letters. These were the only words to be
found beyond the title page in all the thousands of pages in each
volume. The king had made sure that the books began and finished
printing at the same time, and were published at the same time, and
that exactly the same number were published. Neither of the
publishing houses had any perceivable superiority or seniority over
the other.</p>
<p>
'People searched the volumes for clues; they looked for a single
repetition, buried deep in the volumes, where a sentence or even a
letter had been missed out or altered, but they found none. They
turned to the king himself, but he had taken a vow of silence, and
bound up his writing hand. He would still nod or shake his head in
reply to questions concerning the governing of his kingdom, but on
the subject of the two volumes, and the existence or otherwise of
souls, the king would give no sign.</p>
<p>
'Furious disputes arose, many books were written; new cults began.
Then a half-year after the two volumes had been published, two more
appeared, and this time the house that had published the volume
beginning, &quot;Souls do not exist,&quot; published the volume which
began, &quot;Souls do exist.&quot; The other publisher followed suit,
so that theirs now began, &quot;Souls do not exist.&quot; This became
the pattern.</p>
<p>
'The king lived to be very old, and saw several dozen volumes
published. When he was on his death bed, the court philosopher placed
copies of the book on either side of him, hoping the king's head
would fall to one side or the other at the moment of death, so
indicating by the first sentence of the appropriate volume which
conclusion he had really come to... but he died with his head
straight on the pillow and with his eyes, under the eyelids, looking
straight ahead.</p>
<p>
'That was a thousand years ago,' Ky said. 'The books are published
still; they have become an entire industry, an entire philosophy, a
source of un-ending argument and -'</p>
<p>
'Is there an ending to this story?' he asked, holding up one hand.</p>
<p>
'No,' Ky smiled smugly. 'There is not. But that is just the point.'</p>
<p>
He shook his head, got up and left the Crew Lounge.</p>
<p>
'But just because something does not have an ending,' Ky shouted,
'doesn't mean it doesn't have a...'</p>
<p>
The man closed the elevator door, outside in the corridor; Ky rocked
forward in the seat and watched the lift-level indicator ascend to
the middle of the ship. '... conclusion,' Ky said, quietly.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He'd been revived nearly half a year when he almost killed himself.</p>
<p>
He was in the elevator car, watching a torch he had left in the
centre of the car as it slowly spun. He had left the torch switched
on, and put out all the other lights. He watched the tiny spot of
light move slowly around the circular wall of the car, slow as any
clock hand.</p>
<p>
He remembered the search lights of the Staberinde, and wondered how
far they were away from it now. So far that even the sun itself must
be weaker than a searchlight seen from space.</p>
<p>
He did not know why that made him think of just taking off the
helmet, but found himself starting to do it, nevertheless.</p>
<p>
He stopped. It was quite a complicated procedure to open the suit
while in vacuum. He knew each of the steps, but it would take some
time. He looked at the white spot of light which the torch was
shining on the wall of the lift, not far from his head. The white
spot was gradually coming closer as the torch spun. He would start to
ready the suit to take the helmet off; if the torch beam hit his eye
- no, his face, any part of his head - before that, then he would
stop, and go back as though nothing had happened. Otherwise, if the
spot of light did not strike his face in time, he would take the
helmet off and die.</p>
<p>
He allowed himself the luxury of letting the memories wash over him,
while his hands slowly began the sequence that would end, unless
interrupted, with the helmet being blasted off his shoulders by the
air pressure.</p>
<p>
Staberinde, the great metal ship stuck in stone (and a stone ship, a
building stuck in water), and the two sisters. Darckense; Livueta
(and of course he'd realised at the time that he was taking their
names, or something like their names, in making the one he
masqueraded under now). And Zakalwe, and Elethiomel. Elethiomel the
terrible, Elethiomel the Chairmaker...</p>
<p>
The suit beeped at him, trying to warn him he was doing something
very dangerous. The spot of light was a few centimetres from his
head.</p>
<p>
Zakalwe; he tried to ask himself what the name meant to him. What did
it mean to anybody? Ask them all back home; what does this name mean
to you? War, perhaps, in the immediate aftermath; a great family, if
your memory was long enough; a kind of tragedy. If you knew the
story.</p>
<p>
He saw the chair again. Small and white. He closed his eyes, tasting
bitterness in this throat.</p>
<p>
He opened his eyes. Three final clips to go, then one quick twist...
he looked at the spot of light. It was invisible, so close to the
helmet, so close to his head. The torch in the centre of the elevator
car was facing almost straight at him, its lens bright. He undid one
of the three final helmet clips. There was a tiny hiss, barely
noticeable.</p>
<p>
Dead, he thought, seeing the girl's pale face. He undid another clip.
The hiss grew no louder.</p>
<p>
There was a sense of brightness at the side of the helmet, where the
light would be shining.</p>
<p>
Metal ship, stone ship, and the unconventional chair. He felt tears
come to his eyes, and one hand - the one not undoing the third helmet
clip - went to his chest, where, under the many synthetic layers of
the suit, beneath the fabric of the under-suit, there was a small
puckered mark on the skin just over his heart; a scar that was two
decades old, or seven decades old, depending how you measured time.</p>
<p>
The torch swung, and just as the final clip came undone, and the spot
of light started to leave the inside edge of the suit, to shine on
his face, the torch flickered and went out.</p>
<p>
He stared. It was almost totally dark. There was the hint of light
from outside the car; the faintest of red glows, produced by all the
near-dead people and the quietly watching equipment.</p>
<p>
Out. The torch had gone out; charge exhausted or just a fault, it
didn't matter. It had gone out. It hadn't shone on his face. The suit
beeped again, plaintive above the quiet hiss of escaping air.</p>
<p>
He looked down, at the hand that lay over his chest.</p>
<p>
He looked back up at where the torch must be, unseen in the centre of
the car in the centre of the ship, in the middle of its journey.</p>
<p>
How do I die now? he thought.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
He did go back to his chill sleep, after a year. Erens and Ky, their
sexual predilections forever estranging them despite the fact they
seemed like a well-matched couple otherwise, were still arguing when
he left.</p>
<p>
He ended up in another lo-tech war, learning to fly (because he knew
now that aircraft would always win against a battleship), and flying
the frosty vortices of air above the vast white islands that were the
colliding tabular icebergs.</p>

<p>
Where they lay, the discarded robes looked like the just-shed skin of
some exotic reptile. He had been going to wear those, but then
changed his mind. He would wear the clothes he had come here in.</p>
<p>
He stood in the bathroom, in its steams and smells, stopping the
razor again, then putting it to his head, slowly and carefully as
though pulling a comb through his hair in slow motion. The razor
scraped through the foam on his skin, catching a last few stubbly
hairs. He swept the razor past the tops of his ears, then took up a
towel, wiped the gleaming skin of his skull, inspecting the
baby-smooth landscape he had revealed. The long dark hair lay
scattered on the floor, like plumage scattered during a fight.</p>
<p>
He looked out to the citadel parade grounds, where a few weak fires
glowed. Above the mountains, the sky was just starting to become
light.</p>
<p>
From the window, he could see a few craggy levels of the citadel's
curbed wall and jutting towers. In that first outlining light, it
looked, he thought - though trying hard not to feel maudlin -
poignant, even noble, now that he knew it was doomed.</p>
<p>
He turned from the sight and went to put on his shoes. The air moved
over his shaven skull, feeling very strange. He missed the feel and
sweep of his hair on the nape of his neck. He sat on the bed, pulled
on the shoes and clasped them, then looked at the telephone sitting
on the bedside cabinet. He lifted the device.</p>
<p>
He recalled (he seemed to remember) contacting the space port last
night, after Sma and Skaffen-Amtiskaw had gone. He had been feeling
bad, dissociated and remote somehow, and he was not at all certain he
really did remember calling the technicians there, but he thought he
probably had. He'd told them to ready the ancient space craft, for
the Decapitation strike, sometime that morning. Or he hadn't. One of
the two. Maybe he had been dreaming.</p>
<p>
He heard the citadel operator asking him who he wanted. He asked for
the space port.</p>
<p>
He talked to the technicians. The chief flight engineer sounded
tense, excited. The craft was ready, fuelled up, coordinates locked
in; it could be launched within a few minutes as soon as he gave the
word.</p>
<p>
He nodded to himself as he listened to the man. He heard the chief
flight engineer pause. The question was unasked, but there.</p>
<p>
He watched the skies outside the window. They still looked dark, from
inside here. 'Sir?' the chief flight engineer said. 'Sir Zakalwe?
What are your orders, sir?'</p>
<p>
He saw the little blue cube, the button; he heard the whisper of
escaping air. There was a shudder, just then. He thought it was his
own body, reacting involuntarily, but it was not; the shudder ran
through the fabric of the citadel, through the walls of the room,
through the bed beneath him. Glass rattled in the room. The noise of
the explosion rumbled through the air beyond the thick windows, low
and unsettling.</p>
<p>
'Sir?' the man said. 'Are you still there?'</p>
<p>
They would probably intercept the spacecraft; the Culture itself -
the <I>Xenophobe</I>, probably - would use effectors on it... the
decapitation strike was bound to fail...</p>
<p>
'What should we do, sir?'</p>
<p>
But there was always a possibility...</p>
<p>
'Hello? Hello, sir?'</p>
<p>
Another explosion shook the citadel. He looked at the handset he
held. 'Sir, do we go ahead?' he heard a man say, or remembered a man
saying, from long ago and far away... And he had said yes, and taken
on a terrible cargo of memories, and all the names that might bury
him...</p>
<p>
'Stand down,' he said quietly. 'We won't need the strike now,' he
said. He put the handset down, and left the room quickly, taking the
rear stairs, away from the main entrance to his apartments, where he
could already hear a commotion building.</p>
<p>
More explosions shook the citadel, dislodging dust around him as the
curtain wall was breached and breached again. He wondered how it
would be with the regional headquarters, how they would fall, and
whether the raid to capture the high priests would be as bloodless as
Sma had hoped. But he realised even as he thought about it all that
he no longer really cared.</p>
<p>
He left the citadel via a postern and entered the great square that
was the parade ground. The small fires still burned outside the tents
of the refugees. In the distance, great clouds of dust and smoke
floated slowly into the grey dawn sky above the curtain wall. He
could see a couple of gaps in the wall from here. The people in the
tents were starting to wake up and come out. From the citadel walls
at his back and above him, he could hear the crackle of gunfire.</p>
<p>
A heavier gun fired from the breached walls, and a huge explosion
shook the ground, ripping a great hole in the cliff that was the
citadel; an avalanche of stone thundered into the parade ground,
burying a dozen tents. He wondered what sort of ammunition the tank
was firing; not a type they'd had until this morning, he suspected.</p>
<p>
He walked on through the tent city, as the people appeared, blinking,
from their sleep. Scattered firing continued from the citadel; the
vast cloud of dust rolled over the parade ground from the great
tumbled breach in the towering walls. Another shot from near the
curtain walls; another ground-quaking detonation that brought a whole
side of the citadel down, the stones bursting from the wall as though
with relief, falling and tumbling in their own rolling dust;
released, returning to the earth.</p>
<p>
There was less firing from the citadel ramparts now, as the dust
drifted and the sky slowly lightened and the frightened people
clutched at each other outside their tents. More firing came from the
breached curtain walls, and from inside the parade ground, within the
tent city.</p>
<p>
He walked on. Nobody stopped him; few people really seemed to notice
him. He saw a soldier fall from the curtain wall to his right,
tumbling into the dust. He saw the people running this way and that.
He saw the Imperial Army soldiers, in the distance, riding on a tank.</p>
<p>
He walked through the clustered tents, avoiding people running,
stepping over a couple of the smouldering fires. The huge breaches in
the curtain wall and the citadel itself smoked in the increasing grey
light, which was just starting to take on colour as the sky burned
pink and blue.</p>
<p>
Sometimes, as the people milled and streamed around him, running
past, clutching babies, dragging children, he thought he saw people
he recognised, and several times was on the point of turning and
talking to them, putting out his hand to stop the snowfall effaces
rushing past him, shouting after them...</p>
<p>
Suddenly aircraft screamed overhead, tearing through the air over the
curtain wall, dropping long canisters into the tents, which erupted
in flame and black, black smoke. He saw burning people, heard the
screams, smelled the roasting flesh. He shook his head.</p>
<p>
Terrified people jostled him, bumped into him, once knocked him down
so that he had to pick himself up, dust himself down, and suffer the
knocks and the shouts and screams and curses. The aircraft came back,
strafing, and he was the only one who stayed upright, walking while
the rest fell to the ground; he watched the puffs and bursts of dust
fountain in lines around him, saw the clothing of a few of the fallen
people suddenly jerk and flap as a round hit home.</p>
<p>
It was getting lighter as he encountered the first troops. He dodged
behind a tent and rolled as a trooper fired at him, then got back on
his feet and ran round the rear of a tent, almost bumping into
another soldier, who swung his carbine round too late. He kicked it
away. The soldier drew a knife. He let him lunge and took the knife,
throwing the soldier to the ground. He looked at the blade he held in
his hand, and shook his head. He threw the knife away, looked at the
soldier - lying on the ground staring fearfully up at him - then
shrugged and walked away.</p>
<p>
Still people rushing past; soldiers shouting. He saw one take aim at
him, and could not see anywhere to go for cover. He raised his hand
to explain, to say there was really no need, but the man shot him
anyway.</p>
<p>
Not a very good shot, considering the range, he thought as he was
kicked back and spun round by the force of the impact.</p>
<p>
Upper chest near the shoulder. No lung damage, and possibly not even
a chipped rib, he thought as the shock and pain burst through him,
and he fell.</p>
<p>
He lay still in the dust, near the staring face of a dead city
guardsman. As he'd spun round, he'd seen the Culture module; a clear
shape hovering uselessly over the remains of his apartments high in
the ruined citadel.</p>
<p>
Somebody kicked him, turning him over and bursting a rib at the same
time. He tried not to react to the stab of pain, but looked through
cracked eyes. He waited for the <I>coup-de-grace</I>, but it did not
come.</p>
<p>
The shadow-figure above him, dark against light, passed on.</p>
<p>
He lay a while longer, then got up. It wasn't too difficult to walk
at first, but then the planes came back again, and though he didn't
get hit by a bullet, something splintered somewhere nearby, as he
passed by some tents that shook and rippled as the bullets hit them,
and he wondered if the sharp, puncturing pain in his thigh was a bit
of wood or stone, or even bone, from somebody in one of the tents.
'No,' he muttered to himself as he limped away, heading for the
biggest breach in the wall. 'No; not funny. Not bone. Not funny.'</p>
<p>
An explosion blew him off his feet, into and through a tent. He got
up, head buzzing. He looked round and up at the citadel, its summit
starting to glow with the first direct sunlight of the day. He
couldn't see the module any more. He took a shattered wooden tent
pole to use as a crutch; his leg was hurting.</p>
<p>
Dust wrapped him, screams of engines and aircraft and human voices
pierced him; the smells of burning and stone-dust and exhaust fumes
choked him. His wounds talked to him in the languages of pain and
damage, and he had to listen to them, but paid them no further heed.
He was shaken and pummelled and tripped and stumbled and drained and
fell to his knees, and thought perhaps he was hit by more bullets,
but was no longer sure.</p>
<p>
Eventually, near the breach, he fell, and thought he might just lie
here for a while. The light was better, and he felt tired. The dust
drifted like pale shrouds. He looked up at the sky, pale blue, and
thought how beautiful it was, even through all this dust, and,
listening to the tanks as they came crunching up through the slope of
wrecked stones, reflected that, like tanks everywhere, they squeaked
more than they roared.</p>
<p>
'Gentlemen,' (he whispered to the rabid blue sky) 'I am reminded of
something the worshipful Sma said to me once, on the subject of
heroism, which was something like: &quot;Zakalwe, in all the human
societies we have ever reviewed, in every age and every state, there
has seldom if ever been a shortage of eager young males prepared to
kill and die to preserve the security, comfort and prejudices of
their elders, and what you call heroism is just an expression of this
simple fact; there is never a scarcity of idiots.&quot;' He sighed.
'Well, no doubt she didn't say <I>every</I> age and <I>every</I>
state, because the Culture just loves there to be exceptions to
everything, but... that was the gist of it... I think...'</p>
<p>
He rolled over, away from the achingly blue sky, to stare at the
blurred dust.</p>
<p>
Eventually, reluctantly, he pushed himself over, and then half up,
then to his knees, then clutched at the tent-pole crutch and forced
down on it, and got to his feet, ignoring all the pestering aches and
pains, and staggered for the piled wreckage of the walls, and somehow
dragged and hauled and scraped his way to the top, where the walls
ran smooth and wide for a way, like roadways in the sky, and the
bodies of a dozen or so soldiers lay, blood pooling, the ramparts
around them scarred with bullet holes and grey with dust.</p>
<p>
He staggered towards them, as though anxious to be one of their
number. He scanned the skies for the module.</p>
<p>
It was some time before they spotted the &quot;Z&quot; sign he made
from the bodies on the top of the walls, but in that language it was
a complicated letter, and he kept getting mixed up.</p>

<p>
No lights burned on the <I>Staberinde.</I> It sat squat against the
grey leechings of the false dawn, its dim silhouette a piled cone
which only hinted at the concentric loops and lines of its decks and
guns. Some effect of the marsh mists between him and the ziggurat of
the ship made it look as though its black shape was not attached to
the land at all, but floated over it, poised like some threatening
dark cloud.</p>
<p>
He watched with tired eyes, stood on tired feet. This close to the
city and the ship, he could smell the sea, and - nose this close to
the concrete of the bunker - a limey scent, acrid and bitter. He
tried to remember the garden and the smell of flowers, the way he
sometimes did whenever the fighting started to seem just too futile
and cruel to have any point whatsoever, but for once he could not
conjure up that faintly-remembered, beguilingly poignant perfume, or
recall anything good that had come out of that garden (instead he saw
again those sun-tanned hands on his sister's pale hips, the
ridiculous little chair they'd chosen for their fornication... and he
remembered the last time he had seen the garden, the last time he'd
been to the estate; with the tank corps, and he'd seen the chaos and
ruin Elethiomel had visited upon the place that had been the cradle
for both of them; the great house gutted, the stone boat wrecked, the
woods burned... and his last glimpse of the hateful little summer
house where he'd found them, as he took his own retaliatory action
against the tyranny of memory; the tank rocking beneath him, the
already flare-lit clearing whiting out with bright flame, his ears
ringing with a sound that was no sound, and the little house... was
still there; the shot had gone right through, exploded somewhere in
the woods behind, and he'd wanted to weep and scream and tear it all
down with his own hands... but then had remembered the man who had
sat there, and thought how he might treat something like this, and
so had gathered the strength to laugh at it, and ordered the gunner
to aim at the top step beneath the little house, and saw it all
finally lift and burst into the air. The debris fell around the tank,
sprinkling him with earth and wood and ripped bundles of thatch).</p>
<p>
The night beyond the bunker was warm and oppressive, the land's
day-time heat trapped and pressed to the ground by the weight of
clouds above, sticking against the skin of the land like some
sweat-soaked shirt. Perhaps the wind changed then, for he thought he
detected the smell of the grass and the hay in the air, swept
hundreds of kilometres from the great prairies inland by some wind
since spent, the old fragrance going stale now. He closed his eyes
and leant his forehead against the rough concrete of the bunker wall,
beneath the slit he'd been looking through; his fingers splayed out
lightly on the hard, grainy surface, and he felt the warm material
press into his flesh.</p>
<p>
Sometimes all he wanted was for it all to be over, and the way of it
did not really seem to matter. Cessation was all, simple and
demanding and seductive, and worth almost anything. That was when he
had to think of Darckense, trapped on the ship, held captive by
Elethiomel. He knew she didn't love their cousin any more; that had
been something brief and juvenile, something she'd used in her
adolescence to get back at the family for some imagined slight, some
favouring of Livueta over her. It might have seemed like love at the
time, but he suspected even she knew it was not, now. He believed
that Darckense really was an unwilling hostage; many people had been
taken by surprise when Elethiomel attacked the city; just the speed
of the advance had trapped half the population, and Darckense had
been unlucky to be discovered trying to leave from the chaos of the
airport; Elethiomel had had agents out looking for her.</p>
<p>
So for her he had to go on fighting, even if he had almost worn away
the hate in his heart for Elethiomel, the hate that had kept him
fighting these last years, but now was running out, just worn down by
the abrading course of the long war.</p>
<p>
How could Elethiomel do it? Even if he didn't still love her (and the
monster claimed that Livueta was his real desire), how could he use
her like another shell stored in the battleship's cavernous
magazines?</p>
<p>
And what was <I>he</I> supposed to do in reply? Use Livueta against
Elethiomel? Attempt the same level of cunning cruelty?</p>
<p>
Already Livueta blamed <I>him</I>, not Elethiomel, for all that had
happened. What was he supposed to do? Surrender? Barter sister for
sister? Mount some mad, doomed rescue attempt? Simply attack?</p>
<p>
He had tried to explain that only a prolonged siege guaranteed
success, but argued about it so often now that he was starting to
wonder if he was right.</p>
<p>
'Sir?'</p>
<p>
He turned, looked at the dim figures of the commanders behind him.
'What?' he snapped.</p>
<p>
'Sir,' - it was Swaels - 'Sir, perhaps we should be setting off now,
back to headquarters. The cloud is breaking from the east, and it
will be dawn soon... we shouldn't be caught in range.'</p>
<p>
'I know that,' he said. He glanced out at the dark outline of the
<I>Staberinde</I>, and felt himself flinch a little, as though he
expected its huge guns to belch flame right there and then, straight
at him. He drew a metal shutter across the concrete slit. It was very
dark in the bunker for a second, then somebody switched on the harsh
yellow lights and they all stood there, blinking in the glare.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
They left the bunker; the long mass of the armoured staff car waited
in the darkness. Assorted aides and junior officers leapt to
attention, straightened caps, saluted and opened doors. He climbed
into the car, sitting on the fur-covered rear bench, watching as
three of the other commanders followed, sitting in a line opposite
him. The armoured door clanged shut; the car growled and moved,
bumping over the uneven ground and back into the forest, away from
the dark shape resting in the night behind.</p>
<p>
'Sir,' Swaels said, exchanging looks with the other two commanders.
'The other commanders and I have discussed -'</p>
<p>
'You are going to tell me that we should attack; bomb and shell the
<I>Staberinde </I>until it is a flaming hulk and then storm it with
troop hovers,' he said, holding up one hand, 'I know what you've been
discussing and I know what... decisions you think you've arrived at.
They do not interest me.'</p>
<p>
'Sir, we all realise the strain you are under because your sister is
held on the ship, but -'</p>
<p>
'That has nothing to do with it, Swaels,' he told the other man. 'You
insult me by implying that I even consider that a reason for holding
off. My reasons are sound military reasons, and foremost of those is
that the enemy has succeeded in creating a fortress that is, at the
moment, almost impregnable. We must wait until the winner floods,
when the fleet can negotiate the estuary and the channel, and engage
the <I>Staberinde</I> on equal terms; to send in aircraft or attempt
to engage in an artillery duel would be the height of folly.'</p>
<p>
'Sir,' Swaels said. 'Much as we are distressed at having to disagree
with you, we nevertheless -'</p>
<p>
'You will be silent, Commander Swaels,' he said icily. The other man
swallowed. 'I have sufficient matters to worry about without having
to concern myself with the drivel that passes for serious military
planning between my senior officers, or, I might add, with replacing
any of those senior officers.'</p>
<p>
For a while there was only the distant grumbling noise of the car
engine. Swaels looked shocked; the other two commanders were staring
at the rug floor. Swaels' face looked shiny. He swallowed again. The
voice of the labouring car seemed to emphasize the silence in the
rear compartment as the four men were jostled and shaken; then the
car found a metalled road, and roared off, pressing him back in the
seat, making the other three sway towards him before sitting back
again.</p>
<p>
'Sir, I am ready to lea -'</p>
<p>
'Must this go on?' he complained, hoping to stop Swaels. 'Can't you
lift even this small burden from me? All I ask is that you do as you
ought. Let there be no disagreement; let us fight the enemy, not
amongst ourselves.'</p>
<p>
'... to leave your staff, if you so wish,' Swaels continued.</p>
<p>
Now it was as though the noise of the engine did not intrude inside
the passenger cell at all; a frozen silence - held not in the air,
but in the expression of Swaels' face and the still, tensed bodies of
the other two commanders - seemed to settle over the four, like some
prescient breath of a winter that was still half a year away. He
wanted to close his eyes, but could not show such weakness. He kept
his gaze fixed on the man directly across from him.</p>
<p>
'Sir, I have to tell you that I disagree with the course you are
pursuing, and I am not alone. Sir, please believe me that I and the
other commanders love you as we love our country; with all our
hearts. But because of that love, we cannot stand by while you throw
away everything you stand for and all we believe in trying to defend
a mistaken decision.'</p>
<p>
He saw Swaels' hands knit together, as though in supplication. No
gentleman of breeding, he thought, almost dreamily, ought to begin a
sentence with the unfortunate word &quot;but&quot;...</p>
<p>
'Sir, believe me I wish that I was wrong. I and the other commanders
have done everything to try to accommodate your views, but we cannot.
Sir, if you have any love for any of your commanders, we beseech you;
think again. Remove me if you feel you must, sir, for having spoken
like this; court-martial me, demote me, execute me, forbid my name,
but, sir; reconsider, while there is still time.'</p>
<p>
They sat still, as the car hummed along the road, swerving
occasionally for corners, jiggling left-right or right-left to avoid
craters, and... and we must all look, he thought, as we sit here,
frozen in the weak yellow light, like the stiffening dead.</p>
<p>
'Stop the car,' he heard himself saying. His finger was already
depressing the intercom button. The car rumbled down through the
gears and came to a halt. He opened the door. Swaels' eyes were
closed.</p>
<p>
'Get out,' he told him.</p>
<p>
Swaels looked suddenly like an old man hit by the first of many
blows. It was as though he had shrunk, collapsed inside. A warm gust
of wind threatened to close the door again; he held it open with one
hand.</p>
<p>
Swaels bent forward and get slowly out of the car. He stood by the
dark roadside for a moment; the cone of light thrown out by the staff
car's interior lights swept across his face, then disappeared.</p>
<p>
Zakalwe locked the door, 'Drive on,' he told the driver.</p>
<p>
They raced away from the dawn and the <I>Staberinde</I>, before its
guns could find and destroy them.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
They had thought they'd won. In the spring they'd had more men and
more materiel and in particular they had more heavy guns; at sea the
<I>Stabennde</I> lurked as a threat but not a presence, famished of
the fuel it needed for effective raids against their forces and
convoys; almost more of a liability. But then Elethiomel had had the
great battleship tugged and dredged through the seasonal channels,
over the ever-changing banks to the empty dry-dock, where they'd
blasted the extra room and somehow got the ship inside, closed the
gates, pumped out the water and pumped in concrete, and - so his
advisors had suggested - probably some sort of shock-absorbing
cushion between the metal and the concrete, or the half-metre calibre
guns would have shaken the vessel to pieces by now. They suspected
Elethiomel had used rubbish; junk, to line the sides of his
improvised fortress.</p>
<p>
He found that almost amusing.</p>
<p>
The <I>Staberinde</I> was not really impregnable (though it was, now,
quite literally unsinkable); it could be taken, but it would exact a
terrible price in the taking.</p>
<p>
And of course, having had their breathing space, and time to
re-equip, perhaps the forces in and around the ship and the city
would break out; that possibility had been discussed, too, and
Elethiomel was quite capable of it.</p>
<p>
But whatever he thought about it, however he approached the problem,
it always came back to him. The men would do as he asked; the
commandrs would too, or he'd have them replaced; the politicians and
the church had given him a free hand and would back him in anything
he did. He felt secure in that; as secure as any commander ever
could. But what <I>was</I> he to do?</p>
<p>
He had expected to inherit a perfectly drilled peace-time army,
splendid and impressive, and eventually to hand that over to some
other young scion of the Court in the same creditable condition, so
that the traditions of honour and obedience and duty could be
continued. Instead he found himself at the head of an army going to
furious war against an enemy he knew was largely made up of his own
countrymen, and commanded by a man he had once thought of as a friend
as well as almost a brother.</p>
<p>
So he had to give orders that meant men died, and sometimes
sacrifice hundreds, thousands of them, knowingly sending them to
their near-certain deaths, just to secure some important position or
goal, or protect some vital position. And always, whether they liked
it or not, the civilians suffered too; the very people they both
claimed to be fighting for made up perhaps the bulk of the casualties
in their bloody struggle.</p>
<p>
He had tried to stop it, tried to bargain, from the beginning, but
neither side wanted peace on anything except its own terms, and he
had no real political power, and so had had to fight. His success had
amazed him, as it had others, probably not least Elethiomel, but now,
poised on the brink of victory - perhaps - he just did not know what
to do.</p>
<p>
More than anything else now, though, he wanted to save Darckense. He
had seen too many dead, dry eyes, too much air-blackened blood, too
much fly-blown flesh, to be able to relate such ghastly truths to the
nebulous ideas of honour and tradition that people claimed they were
fighting for. Only the well-being of one loved person seemed really
worth fighting for now; it was all that seemed real, all that could
save his sanity. To acknowledge the interest millions of other people
had in whatever happened here was to place too great a burden on him;
it would be to admit, by implication, that he was at least partially
responsible for the deaths already of hundreds of thousands, even if
nobody else could have fought more humanely.</p>
<p>
So he waited; held back the commanders and the squadron leaders, and
waited for Elethiomel to reply to his signals.</p>
<p>
The two other commanders said nothing. He put out the lights in the
car, un-shuttered the doors, and looked out at the dark mass of the
forest, racing past under dull dawn skies the colour of steel.</p>
<p>
They moved past dim bunkers, dark trenches, still figures, stopped
trucks, sunken tanks, taped windows, hooded guns, raised poles, grey
clearings, wrecked buildings and slitted lamps; all the paraphernalia
of the outskirts of the headquarters camp. He watched it all and
wished - as they moved closer to the centre, to the old castle that
had become his home in all but name over the last couple of months -
he wished that he did not have to stop, and could just go on driving
through the dawn and the day and the night again forever, cleaving
the finally unyielding trees towards nothing and nowhere and no-one -
even if it was in an icy silence - secure in the nadir of his
sufferings, perversely content that at least now they could grow no
worse; just to go on and on and never have to stop and make decisions
that would not wait but which might mean he would commit mistakes he
could never forget and would never be forgiven for...</p>
<p>
The car reached the castle courtyard and he got out. Surrounded by
aides, he swept into the grand old house that had, once, been
Elethiomel's HQ.</p>
<p>
They pestered him with a hundred details of logistics and
intelligence reports and skirmishes and small amounts of ground lost
or gained; there were requests from civilians and the foreign press
for this and that. He dismissed them all, told the junior commanders
to deal with them. He took the stairs to his offices two at a time,
handed his jacket and cap to his ADC, and closed himself in his
darkened study, his eyes closed, his back against the double doors,
the brass handles still clutched in his hands at the small of his
back. The quiet, dark room was a balm.</p>
<p>
'Been out to gaze upon the beast, have you?'</p>
<p>
He started, then recognized Livueta's voice. He saw her by the
windows, a dark figure. He relaxed. 'Yes,' he said. 'Close the
drapes.'</p>
<p>
He turned on the room lights.</p>
<p>
'What are you going to do?' she said, walking slowly closer, her arms
folded, her dark hair gathered up, her face troubled.</p>
<p>
'I don't know,' he admitted, going to the desk and sitting. He put
his face in his hands and rubbed it. 'What would you have me do?'</p>
<p>
'Talk with him,' she said, sitting on the corner of the desk, arms
still crossed. She was dressed in a long dark skirt, dark jacket. She
was always in dark clothes now-days.</p>
<p>
'He won't talk to me,' he said, sitting back in the ornate chair he
knew the junior officers called his throne. 'I can't make him reply.'</p>
<p>
'You can't be saying the right things,' she said.</p>
<p>
'I don't know what to say, then,' he said, closing his eyes again.
'Why don't you compose the next message?'</p>
<p>
'You wouldn't let me say what I'd want to say, or if you let me say
it, you wouldn't live up to it.'</p>
<p>
'We can't just all lay down our weapons, Livvy, and I don't think
anything else would work; he wouldn't pay any attention.'</p>
<p>
'You could meet face to face; that might be the way to settle
things.'</p>
<p>
'Livvy; the first messenger we sent personally came back without his
SKIN!' He screamed the last word, suddenly losing all patience and
control. Livueta flinched, and stepped away from the desk. She sat in
an ornamental winged couch, her long fingers rubbing at the gold
thread sewn into an arm.</p>
<p>
'I'm sorry,' he said quietly. 'I didn't mean to shout.'</p>
<p>
'She's our sister, Cheradenine. There must be more we can do.'</p>
<p>
He looked about the room, as though for some fresh inspiration,
'Livvy; we have been over this and over this and over this; don't
you... can't I get it through? Isn't it clear?' He slapped both hands
on the desk. 'I am doing all I can. I want her out of there as much
as you do, but while he has her, there is just nothing more I can do;
except attack, and that probably would be the death of her.'</p>
<p>
She shook her head. 'What is it between you two?' she asked. 'Why
won't you talk to each other? How can you forget everything from when
we were children?'</p>
<p>
He shook his head, pushed himself up from the desk, turned to the
book-lined wall behind, gaze running over the hundreds of titles
without really seeing them. 'Oh,' he said tiredly, 'I haven't
forgotten, Livueta.' He felt a terrible sadness then, as though the
extent of what he felt they had all lost only became real to him when
there was somebody else there to acknowledge it. 'I haven't forgotten
anything.'</p>
<p>
'There must be something else you can do,' she insisted.</p>
<p>
'Livueta, please believe me; there isn't.'</p>
<p>
'I believed you when you told me she was safe and well,' the woman
said, looking down at the arm of the couch, where her long nails had
started to pick at the precious thread. Her mouth was a tight line.</p>
<p>
'You were ill,' he sighed.</p>
<p>
'What difference does that make?'</p>
<p>
'You might have died!' he said. He went to the curtains and began
straightening them. 'Livueta; I couldn't have told you they had
Darckle; the shock -'</p>
<p>
'The shock for this poor, weak woman,' Livueta said, shaking her
head, still tearing at the threads on the couch arm. 'I'd rather you
spared me that insulting nonsense than spare me the truth about my
own sister.'</p>
<p>
'I was only trying to do what was best,' he told her, starting
towards her, then stopping, retreating to the corner of the desk
where she had sat.</p>
<p>
'I'm sure,' she said laconically. 'The habit of taking
responsibility comes with your exalted position, I suppose. I am
expected to be grateful, no doubt.'</p>
<p>
'Livvy, please, must you -?'</p>
<p>
'Must I what?' She looked at him, eyes sparkling. 'Must I make life
difficult for you? Yes?'</p>
<p>
'All I want,' he said slowly, trying to control himself. 'Is for you
to try... and understand. We need to... to stick together, to support
each other right now.'</p>
<p>
'You mean I have to support you even though you won't support
Darckle,' Livueta said.</p>
<p>
'Dammit, Livvy!' he shouted. 'I am doing my best! There isn't just
her; there's a lot of other people I have to worry about. All my men;
the civilians in the city; the whole damn country!' He went forward
to her, knelt in front of the winged couch, put his hand on the same
arm that her long-nailed hand picked at. 'Livueta; please. I am doing
all it is possible to do. Help me in this. Back me up. The other
commanders want to attack; I'm all there is between Darckense and -'</p>
<p>
'Maybe you should attack,' she said suddenly. 'Maybe that's the one
thing he isn't expecting.'</p>
<p>
He shook his head. 'He has her in the ship; we'd have to destroy that
before we can take the city.' He looked her in the eye. 'Do you trust
him not to kill her, even if she isn't killed in the attack?'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' Livueta said. 'Yes, I do.'</p>
<p>
He held her gaze for a while, certain that she would recant or at
least look away, but she just kept looking straight back at him.
'Well,' he said eventually, 'I can't take that risk.' He sighed,
closing his eyes, resting his head against the arm of the couch.
'There's so much... pressure on me.' He tried to take her hand, but
she pulled it away. 'Livueta, don't you think I <I>feel</I>?<I> </I>Don't
you think I care about what happens to Darckle? Do you think that I'm
not still the brother you knew as well as the soldier they made me?
Do you think that because I have an army to do my bidding, and ADCs
and junior officers to obey every whim, I don't get <I>lonely</I>?'</p>
<p>
She stood up suddenly, without touching him. 'Yes,' she said, looking
down at him, while he looked at the threads of gold on the couch arm.
'You are lonely, and I am lonely, and Darckense is lonely, and he is
lonely, and everybody is <I>lonely</I>!'</p>
<p>
She turned quickly, the long skirt briefly belling, and walked to the
door and out. He heard the doors slam, and stayed where he was,
kneeling in front of the abandoned couch like some rejected suitor.
He pushed his smallest finger through a loop in the gold thread
Livueta had teased from the couch arm, and pulled at it until it
burst.</p>
<p>
He got up slowly, walked to the window, slipped through the drapes
and stood looking out at the grey dawn. Men and machines moved
through the vague wisps of mist, grey skeins like nature's own gauzy
camouflage nets.</p>
<p>
He envied the men he could see. He was sure most of them envied him,
in return; he was in control, he had the soft bed and did not have to
tread through trench mud, or deliberately stub his toes against rocks
to keep awake on guard duty... But he envied them, nevertheless,
because they only had to do what they were told. And - he admitted to
himself - he envied Elethiomel.</p>
<p>
Would that he were more like him, he thought, all too often. To have
that ruthless cunning, that extemporising guile; <I>he</I> wanted
that.</p>
<p>
He slunk back through the drapes, guilty at the thought. At the desk
he turned the room lights off and sat back in the seat. His throne,
he thought and, for the first time in days, laughed a little, because
it was such an image of power and he felt so utterly powerless.</p>
<p>
He heard a truck draw up outside the window, where it was not
supposed to. He sat still, suddenly thinking; a massive bomb, just
out there... and was suddenly terrified. He heard a sergeant barking,
some talk, and then the truck moved a little way off, though he could
still hear its engine.</p>
<p>
After a while, he heard raised voices in the hall stair-well. There
was something about the tone of the voices that chilled him. He tried
to tell himself he was being foolish, and turned all the lights back
on, but he could still hear them. Then there was something like a
scream, cut-off abruptly. He shook. He unholstered his pistol,
wishing he had something more lethal than this slim little
dress-uniform gun. He went to the door. The voices sounded odd; some
were raised, while some people were apparently trying to keep theirs
quiet. He opened the door a crack, then went through; his ADC was at
the far door, onto the stairs, looking down.</p>
<p>
He put the pistol back in his holster. He walked out to join the ADC,
and followed his gaze, down into the hall. He saw Livueta, staring
wide-eyed back up at him; there were a few other soldiers, one of the
other commanders. They stood round a small white chair. He frowned;
Livueta looked upset.He went quickly down the steps; Livueta suddenly
came bounding up to meet him, skirt hem flying. She pushed into him,
both hands against his chest. He staggered back, amazed.</p>
<p>
'No,' she said. Her eyes were bright and staring; her face looked
more pale than he'd ever seen before. 'Go back,' she said. Her voice
sounded thick, like it was not her own.</p>
<p>
'Livueta...' he said, annoyed, and pushed himself away from the wall,
trying to glance round her at whatever was happening in the hall
round the little white chair.</p>
<p>
She pushed him again. 'Go back,' the thick, strange voice said.</p>
<p>
He took her wrists in his hands, '<I>Livueta</I>,' he said, voice
low, eyes flicking to indicate the people standing beneath in the
hall.</p>
<p>
'Go back,' the strange, terrifying voice said.</p>
<p>
He pushed her away, annoyed at her, tried to go past her. She
attempted to grab him from behind. 'Back!' she gasped.</p>
<p>
'Livueta, stop this!' he shook her off, embarrassed now. He clattered
quickly down the steps before she could grab him again.</p>
<p>
Still she threw herself down after him, clutched at his waist. 'Go
<I>back</I>!' she wailed.</p>
<p>
He turned round. 'Get off me! I want to see what's going on!' He was
stronger than her; he tore her arms free, threw her down on the
stairs. He went down, walked across the flagstones to where the
silent group of men stood round the little white chair.</p>
<p>
It was very small; it looked so delicate that an adult might have
broken it. It was small and white, and as he took a couple of more
paces forwards, as the rest of the people and the hall and the castle
and the world and the universe disappeared into the darkness and the
silence and he came closer and slowly closer to the chair, he saw
that it had been made out of the bones of Darckense Zakalwe.</p>
<p>
Femora formed the back legs, tibiae and some other bones the front.
Arm bones made the seat frame; the ribs were the back. Beneath them
was the pelvis; the pelvis that had been shattered years earlier, in
the stone boat, its bone fragments rejoined; the darker material the
surgeons had used quite visible too. Above the ribs, there was the
collar bone, also broken and healed, memoir of a riding accident.</p>
<p>
They had tanned her skin and made a little cushion out of it; a tiny
plain button in her navel, and at one corner, just the hint, the
start of some dark but slightly red-tinged hair.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
There were stairs, and Livueta, and the ADC, and the ADC's office,
between there and here, he found himself thinking, as he stood at his
desk again.</p>
<p>
He tasted blood in his mouth, looked down at his right hand. He
seemed to recall having punched Livueta on his way up the stairs.
What a terrible thing to do to one's own sister.</p>
<p>
He looked about, distracted, for a moment. Everything looked blurred.</p>
<p>
Intending to rub his eyes, he raised one hand and found the pistol in
it.</p>
<p>
He put it to his right temple.</p>
<p>
This was, of course, he realised, exactly what Elethiomel wanted him
to do, but then, what chance did one have against such a monster?
There was only so much a man could take, after all.</p>
<p>
He smiled at the doors (somebody was thumping on them, calling out a
word that might have been his name; he couldn't remember now). So
silly. Doing the Right Thing; the Only Way Out. The Honourable Exit.
What a load of nonsense. Just despair, just the last laugh to have,
opening a mouth through the bone to confront the world direct; here.</p>
<p>
But such consummate skill, such ability, such adaptability, such
numbing ruthlessness, such a use of weapons when anything could
become <I>weapon</I>...</p>
<p>
His hand was shaking. He could see the doors starting to give way;
somebody must be hitting them very hard. He supposed he must have
locked them; there was nobody else in the room. He ought to have
chosen a bigger gun, he realised; this one might not be big enough to
do the job.</p>
<p>
His mouth was very dry.</p>
<p>
He pressed the gun hard against his temple and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The besieged forces round the <I>Staberinde</I> broke out within the
hour, while the surgeons were still fighting for his life. It was a
good battle, and they nearly won.</p>

<p>
'Zakalwe...'</p>
<p>
'No.'</p>
<p>
Still the same refusal. They stood in a park, at the edge of a large,
neatly mown lawn, under some tall, pollarded trees. The warm breeze
carried the ocean scent and a hint of flowers, whispering through the
copse. The clearing morning mist still veiled two suns. Sma shook her
head in exasperation, and walked off a little way.</p>
<p>
He leant against a tree, clutching at his chest, breathing with
difficulty. Skaffen-Amtiskaw hovered nearby, keeping a watch on the
man, but playing with an insect on the trunk of another tree.</p>
<p>
Skaffen-Amtiskaw thought the man was mad; certainly he was weird. He
had never really explained why he'd gone wandering through the mayhem
of the citadel-storming. When Sma and the drone had finally found him
and picked him up, bullet-riddled, half-dead and raving from the top
of the curtain wall, he had insisted they stabilise his condition; no
more. He did not want to be made well. He would not listen to sense,
and still the <I>Xenophobe -</I> when it had picked them all up - had
refused to pronounce the man insane and incapable of making up his
own mind, and so had dutifully put him into a low-metabolism sleep
for the fifteen day journey to the planet where the women called
Livueta Zakalwe now lived.</p>
<p>
He'd come out of his slow-sleep as ill as he'd gone into it. The man
was a walking mess and there were still two bullets inside him, but
he refused to accept any treatment until he'd seen this woman.
Bizarre, Skaffen-Amtiskaw thought, using an extended field to block
the path of a small insect as it felt and picked its way up the trunk
of the tree. The insect changed direction, feelers waving. There was
another type of insect further up the trunk, and Skaffen-Amtiskaw was
trying to get them to meet, to see what would happen.</p>
<p>
Bizarre, and even - indeed - perverse.</p>
<p>
'Okay.' He coughed (one lung, the drone knew, filling up with blood).
'Let's go.' He pushed himself away from the tree. Skaffen-Amtiskaw
abandoned its game with the two insects regretfully. The drone felt
odd, being here; the planet was known about but had not yet been
fully investigated by Contact. It had been discovered through
research rather than physical exploration, and - while there was
nothing obviously outlandish about the place, and a very rudimentary
survey had been carried out - technically it was still terra
incognita, and Skaffen-Amtiskaw was on a relatively high state of
alert, just in case the place held any nasty surprises.</p>
<p>
Sma went to the bald-headed man and put her arm round his waist,
helping to support him. Together they walked up the small slope of
lawn towards a low ridge. Skaffen-Amtiskaw watched them go, from the
cover of the tree tops, then swooped slowly down towards them as they
walked to the summit of the gentle slope.</p>
<p>
The man staggered when he saw what was on the far side, in the
distance. The drone suspected he would have fallen to the grass if
Sma hadn't been there to hold him up.</p>
<p>
'Shiiit,' he breathed, and tried to straighten, blinking in a sudden
slant of sunlight as the mists continued to evaporate.</p>
<p>
He stumbled another couple of steps, shook Sma off, and turned round
once, taking in the parkland; shaped trees and manicured lawns,
ornamental walls and delicate pergolas, stone-bordered ponds and
shady paths through quiet groves. And, in the distance, set amongst
mature trees, the tattered black shape of the <I>Staberinde.</I></p>
<p>
'They've made a fucking park out of it,' he breathed, and stood,
swaying, bent slightly at the waist, looking at the battered
silhouette of the old warship. Sma walked to his side. He seemed to
sag a little, and she put her arm round his waist again. He grimaced
with pain; they walked on, down towards a path which led to the ship.</p>
<p>
'Why did you want to see this, Cheradenine?' Sma said quietly as they
crunched along the gravel. The drone floated behind and above.</p>
<p>
'Hmm?' the man said, taking his eyes off the ship for a second.</p>
<p>
'Why did you want to come here, Cheradenine?' Sma asked. 'She isn't
here. This isn't where she is.'</p>
<p>
'I know,' he breathed. 'I know that.'</p>
<p>
'So why do you want to see this wreck?'</p>
<p>
He was silent for a little while. It was as though he hadn't heard,
but then he took a deep breath - flinching with pain as he did so -
and shook his sweat-sheened head as he said, 'Oh; just for... old
times' sake...' They passed through another copse of trees. He shook
his shaved head again as they came out of the grove, and saw the ship
better. 'I just didn't think... they'd do this to it,' he said.</p>
<p>
'Do what?' Sma asked.</p>
<p>
'This.' He nodded at the blackened hulk.</p>
<p>
'What have they done, Cheradenine?' Sma said patiently.</p>
<p>
'Made it.' He began, then stopped, coughed, body tense with pain.
'Made the damn thing... an ornament. Preserved it.'</p>
<p>
'What, the ship?'</p>
<p>
He looked at her as though she were crazy. 'Yes,' he said. 'Yes; the
ship.'</p>
<p>
Just a big old battleship hulk cemented into a dock, as far as
Skaffen-Amtiskaw could see. It contacted the <I>Xenophobe</I>, which
was passing the time by making a detailed map of the planet.</p>
<p>
- Hello, ship. This ship-ruin in the park; Zakalwe seems very
interested. Just wondering why. Care to do some research?</p>
<p>
- In a while; I've still got one continent, the deep sea beds and the
sub-surface to do.</p>
<p>
- They'll still be there later; this could prove interesting now.</p>
<p>
- Patience, Skaffen-Amtiskaw.</p>
<p>
Pedant, thought the drone, breaking off.</p>
<p>
The two humans walked down twisty paths past litter bins and benches,
picnic tables and information points. Skaffen-Amtiskaw activated one
of the old information points as it passed. A slow and crackly tape
started up; &quot;The vessel you see before you...&quot; This was
going to take ages, Skaffen-Amtiksaw thought. It used its effector to
speed the machine up, winding the voice up into a high-pitched
warble. The tape broke. Skaffen-Amtiskaw delivered the effector
equivalent of an annoyed slap, and left the information machine
smoking and dripping burning plastic onto the gravel beneath, as the
two humans walked into the shadow of the battered ship.</p>
<p>
The ship had been left as it was; bombed, shelled, strafed, blasted
and ripped but not destroyed. Where hands could not reach and rain
did not strike, traces of the original soot from flames two centuries
old still marked the armour plate. Gun turrets lay peeled open like
tin cans; gun barrels and range-finders bristled askew all over the
mounting levels of deck; tangled stays and fallen aeriels lay strewn
over shattered search lights and lop-sided radar dishes; the single
great funnel looked tipped and subsided, metal pitted and flayed.</p>
<p>
A little awning-covered stairway led up to the ship's main deck; they
followed a couple with two young children. Skaffen-Amtiskaw floated,
almost invisible, ten metres away, rising slowly with them. One of
the toddlers cried when she saw the hobbling, bald-headed man with
the staring eyes behind her. Her mother lifted her up and carried
her.</p>
<p>
He had to stop and rest when they got to the deck. Sma guided him to
a bench. He sat doubled up for a while, then looked at the ship
above, taking in the blackened rusted wreckage all around. He shook
his shaven head, muttered to himself once, then ended up laughing
quietly, holding his chest and coughing.</p>
<p>
'Museum,' he said. 'A museum...' Sma put her hand on his damp brow.
She thought he looked terrible, and the baldness didn't suit him. The
simple dark clothes they'd found him wearing when they picked him up
from the citadel's curtain wall had been torn and crusted with blood;
they'd been cleaned and repaired on the <I>Xenophobe</I> but they
looked out of place here, where everybody seemed to be dressed in
bright colours. Even Sma's culottes and jacket were sombre compared
to the gaily decorated dresses and smocks most of the people were
wearing.</p>
<p>
'This an old haunt of yours, Cheradenine?' she asked him.</p>
<p>
He nodded. 'Yes,' he breathed, looking up at a last few tendrils of
mist flowing and disappearing like gaseous pennants from the tilted
main mast. 'Yes,' he repeated.</p>
<p>
Sma looked round at the park behind and the city off to one side.
'This where you came from?'</p>
<p>
He seemed not to hear. After a while, he stood slowly, and looked,
distracted, into Sma's eyes. She felt herself shiver, and tried to
remember exactly how old Zakalwe was. 'Let's go, Da -... Diziet.' He
smiled a watery sort of smile. 'Take me to her, please?'</p>
<p>
Sma shrugged and supported the man by one shoulder. They went back to
the steps that led back down to the ground.</p>
<p>
'Drone?' Sma said to a brooch on her lapel.</p>
<p>
'Yep?'</p>
<p>
'Our lady still where we last heard?'</p>
<p>
'Indeed,' said the drone's voice. 'Want to take the module?'</p>
<p>
'No,' he said, stumbling down a stair, until Sma caught him. 'Not the
module. Let's... take a train, or a cab or...'</p>
<p>
'You sure?' Sma said.</p>
<p>
'Yes; sure.'</p>
<p>
'Zakalwe,' Sma sighed. '<I>Please</I> accept some treatment.'</p>
<p>
'No,' the man said, as they reached the ground.</p>
<p>
'There's an underground station right and right again,' the drone
told Sma. 'Alight Central Station; platform eight for trains to
Couraz.'</p>
<p>
'Okay,' Sma said reluctantly, glancing at him. He was looking down at
the gravel path as though concentrating on working out which foot to
put in front of another. He swung his head as they passed under the
stem of the ruined battleship, squinting up at the tall curving V of
the bows. Sma watched the expression on his sweating face, and could
not decide whether it was awe, disbelief, or something like terror.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
The underground train whisked them into the city centre down
concrete-lined tunnels; the main station was crowded, tall, echoing
and clean. Sunlight sparkled on the vault of the arched glass roof.
Skaffen-Amtiskaw had done its suitcase impression, and sat lightly in
Sma's hand. The wounded man was a heavier weight on her other arm.</p>
<p>
The Maglev train drew in, disgorged its passengers; they boarded with
a few other people.</p>
<p>
'You going to make it, Cheradenine?' Sma asked him. He was slumped in
the seat, resting his arms on the table in a way that somehow made
them look as though they were broken, or paralysed. He stared at the
seat across from him, ignoring the cityscape as it slid by, the train
accelerating along viaducts towards the suburbs and the countryside.</p>
<p>
He nodded. 'I'll survive.'</p>
<p>
'Yes, but for how much longer?' said the drone, sitting on the table
in front of Sma. 'You are in terrible shape, Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
'Better than looking like a suitcase,' he said, glancing at the
machine.</p>
<p>
'Oh, how droll,' the machine said.</p>
<p>
- You finished drawing things yet? it asked the <I>Xenophobe.</I></p>
<p>
- No.</p>
<p>
- Can't you devote just a <I>little</I> of your supposedly bogglingly
fast Mind to finding out why he was so interested in that ship?</p>
<p>
- Oh, I suppose so, but -</p>
<p>
- Wait a minute; what have we here? Listen to this:</p>
<p>
'... You'll find out, I suppose. Past time I told you,' he said,
looking out of the window but talking to Sma. The city slid by
beyond, bright in the sunlight. His eyes were wide, pupils dilated,
and somehow Sma got the impression he was looking at one city, but
seeing another, or seeing the same one but long ago, as though in
some time-polarised light only his distressed, enfevered eyes could
see.</p>
<p>
'This is where you come from?'</p>
<p>
'Long time ago, now,' he said, coughing, doubling up, holding one arm
tight to his side. He took a long slow breath. 'I was born here...'</p>
<p>
The woman listened. The drone listened. The ship listened.</p>
<p>
While he told them the story, of the great house that lay halfway
between the mountains and the sea, upstream from the great city. He
told them about the estate surrounding the house, and the beautiful
gardens, and about the three, later four, children who were brought
up in the house, and who played in the garden. He told them about the
summerhouses and the stone boat and the maze and the fountains and
the lawns and the ruins and the animals in the woods. He told them
about the two boys and the two girls, and the two mothers, and the
one strict father and the one unseen father, imprisoned in the city.
He told them about the visits to the city, which the children always
thought lasted too long, and about the time when they were no longer
allowed to go into the garden without guards to escort them, and
about how they stole a gun, one day, and were going to take it out
into the estate to shoot it, but only got as far as the stone boat,
and surprised an assassination squad come to kill the family, and
saved the day by alerting the house. He told them about the bullet
that hit Darckense, and the sliver of her bone that</p>
<p>
pierced him almost to his heart.</p>
<p>
He started to dry up, voice croaking. Sma saw a waiter pushing a
trolley into the far end of the coach. She bought a couple of soft
drinks; he gulped at first, but coughed painfully, and then just
sipped his.</p>
<p>
'And the war did start,' he said, looking at but not seeing the last
of the suburbs flow past; the countryside was a green blur as they
accelerated again. 'And the two boys, that had become men... ended up
on different sides.'</p>
<p>
- Fascinating, the <I>Xenophobe</I> communicated to Skaffen-Amtiskaw.
I think I will do a little quick research.</p>
<p>
- About time too, the drone sent back, listening to the man talk at
the same time.</p>
<p>
He told them about the war, and the siege that involved the
<I>Staberinde</I>, and the besieged forces breaking out... and he
told them about the man, the boy who'd played in the garden who, in
the depths of one terrible night, had caused the thing to be done
which led to him being called the Chairmaker, and the dawn when
Darckense's sister and brother had found what Elethiomel had done,
and the brother trying to take his own life, giving up his
generalship, abandoning the armies and his sister in the selfishness
of despair.</p>
<p>
And he told them about Livueta, who had never forgiven, and had
followed him - though he did not know it at the time - on another
cold ship, for a century through the intractable calm slowness of
real space, to a place where the icebergs swirled round a continental
pole, forever calving and crashing and shrinking... But then she had
lost him, the trail gone appropriately cold, and she had stayed
there, searching, for years, and could not have known that he had
left for another life entirely, taken away by the tall lady who
walked through the blizzard as though it wasn't there, a small space
ship at her back like a faithful pet.</p>
<p>
And so Livueta Zakalwe gave up, and took another long journey, to get
away from the burden of her memories, and where she had ended up -
(the ship quizzed the drone for the location; Skaffen-Amtiskaw gave
it the name of the planet and the system, a few decades away) - that
had been where she'd finally been tracked down, after his last job
for them.</p>
<p>
Skaffen-Amtiskaw remembered. The grey-haired woman, in her early
late-years, working in a clinic in the slums, a delicate shanty town
strewn like trash across the mud and tree-lined slopes above a
tropical city looking out across sparkling lagoons and golden
sandbars to the rollers of a vast ocean. Thin, marks under her eyes,
a pot-bellied child on each hip when they first went to see her,
standing in the middle of the crowded room, wailing children tugging
at her hems.</p>
<p>
The drone had learned to appreciate the full range of pan-human
facial expression, and thought that, in witnessing the one that
appeared on Livueta Zakalwe's face when she saw Zakalwe, it had
experienced something close to unique. Such surprise; but such
hatred!</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine...' Sma said tenderly, gently laying one hand on his.
She put her other hand to the nape of his neck, stroking him there as
his head bent lower to the table. He turned and watched the prairie
stream past like a sea of gold.</p>
<p>
He put one hand up, smoothing it slowly over his brow and shaved
scalp, as though through long hair.</p>
<p class="gap"></p>
<p>
Couraz had been everything; ice and fire, land and water. Once, the
broad isthmus had been a place of rock and glaciers, then a land of
forests as the world and its continents shifted and the climate
altered. Later it became a desert, but then suffered something beyond
the capacity of the globe itself to provide. An asteroid the size of
a mountain hit the isthmus, like a bullet striking flesh.</p>
<p>
It burst into the granite heart of the land, ringing the planet like
a bell. Two oceans met for the first time; the dust of the immense
explosion blocked out the sun, started a small ice age, wiped out
thousands of species. The ancestors of the species that later came to
rule the planet took their initial opportunity from that cataclysm.</p>
<p>
The crater became a dome as the planet reacted over the millennia;
the oceans were separated again when the rocks - even the seemingly
solid layers flowing and warping, over those great scales of time and
distance - pushed back, like an aeons late bruise forming on the skin
of the world.</p>
<p>
Sma had found the information brochure in a seat pocket. She looked
up from it for a moment at the man in the seat beside her. He'd
fallen asleep. His face looked drawn and grey and old. She could not
remember ever having seen him look so ancient and ill. Dammit, he'd
looked healthier when he'd been beheaded. 'Zakalwe,' she whispered,
shaking her head. 'What's wrong with you?'</p>
<p>
'Death-wish,' the drone muttered, quietly. 'With extrovert
complications.'</p>
<p>
Sma shook her head and went back to the brochure. The man slept
fitfully and the drone monitored him.</p>
<p>
Reading about Couraz, Sma suddenly recalled the great fortress she
had been picked up from by the <I>Xenophobe's</I> module, on a sunny
day that now seemed as long ago as it was far away. She looked up,
sighing, from a photograph of the isthmus taken from space, and
thought back to the house under the dam, and felt home-sick... Couraz
had been a fortified town, a prison, a fortress, a city, a target.
Now - perhaps appropriately, Sma thought, looking at the injured,
shivering man at her side - the great dome of rock held a small city
that was mostly taken up with the biggest hospital in the world.</p>
<p>
The train hurtled into a tunnel carved from naked rock.</p>
<p>
They passed through the station, took an elevator to one of the
hospital reception levels. They sat on a couch, surrounded by potted
plants and soft music, while the drone, sitting on the floor at their
feet, plundered the nearest computer work station for information.</p>
<p>
'Got her,' it announced quietly. 'Go to the receptionist and tell her
your name; I've ordered you a pass; no verification required.'</p>
<p>
'Come on, Zakalwe.' Sma rose, collected her pass, and helped him to
his feet. He staggered. 'Look,' she said, 'Cheradenine, let me at -'</p>
<p>
'Just take me to her.'</p>
<p>
'Let me talk to her first.'</p>
<p>
'No; take me to her. Now.'</p>
<p>
The ward was up another few levels, in the sunlight. The light came
through clear, high windows. The sky was white with scudding cloud
outside, and way in the distance, beyond the dappkd fields and
woodland, the ocean was a line of blue haze beneath the sky.</p>
<p>
Old men lay quietly in the broad, partitioned ward. Sma helped him
towards the far end, where the drone said Livueta must be. They
entered a short, broad corridor. Livueta came out of a side room. She
stopped when she saw them.</p>
<p>
Livueta Zakalwe looked older; white-haired, skin soft and lined with
age. Her eyes were undulled. She drew herself up a little. She was
holding a deep-sided tray full of little boxes and bottles.</p>
<p>
Livueta looked at them; the man, the woman, the little pale suitcase
that was the drone.</p>
<p>
Sma glanced to one side, hissed, 'Zakalwe!' She hauled him more
upright.</p>
<p>
His eyes had been shut. They blinked open and he squinted uncertainly
at the woman standing in front of them. He appeared not to recognise
her at first, then, slowly, understanding seemed to filter through.</p>
<p>
'Livvy?' he said, blinking quickly, squinting at her. 'Livvy?'</p>
<p>
'Hello, Ms Zakalwe,' Sma said, when the woman did not reply.</p>
<p>
Livueta Zakalwe turned contemptuous eyes from the man half-hanging
from Sma's right arm. She looked at Sma and shook her head, so that
just for an instant, Sma thought she was going to say no, she wasn't
Livueta.</p>
<p>
'Why do you keep doing this?' Livueta Zakalwe said softly. Her voice
was still young, the drone thought, just as the <I>Xenophobe</I> came
back with some fascinating information it had gleaned from historical
records.</p>
<p>
(- <I>Really</I>? the drone signalled. Dead?)</p>
<p>
'Why do you do this?' she said. 'Why do you do this... to him; to
me... why? Can't you just leave us all alone?'</p>
<p>
Sma shrugged, a little awkwardly.</p>
<p>
'Livvy...' he said.</p>
<p>
'I'm sorry, Ms Zakalwe,' Sma said. 'It's what he wanted; we
promised.'</p>
<p>
'Livvy; please; talk to me; let me ex -'</p>
<p>
'You shouldn't do this,' Livueta told Sma. Then she turned her gaze
to the man, who was rubbing one hand over his shaved scalp, grinning
inanely at her, blinking. 'He looks sick,' she said flatly.</p>
<p>
'He is,' Sma said.</p>
<p>
'Bring him in here.' Livueta Zakalwe opened another door; a room with
a bed. Skaffen-Amtiskaw, still wondering exactly what was going on in
the light of the information it had just received from the ship,
still found the time to be mildly surprised that the woman was taking
it all so calmly this time. Last time she'd tried to kill the fellow
and it had had to move in smartly.</p>
<p>
'I don't want to lie down,' he protested, when he saw the bed.</p>
<p>
'Then just sit, Cheradenine,' Sma said. Livueta Zakalwe made a
snaking motion with her head, muttered something even the drone could
not make out. She placed the tray of drugs down on a table, stood in
one corner of the room, arms crossed, while the man sat down on the
bed.</p>
<p>
'I'll leave you alone,' Sma said to the woman. 'We'll be just
outside.'</p>
<p>
Close enough for me to hear, thought the drone, and to stop her
trying to murder you again, if that's what she decides to do.</p>
<p>
'No,' the woman said, shaking her head, looking with an odd
dispassion at the man on the bed. 'No; don't leave. There's nothing
-'</p>
<p>
'But I want them to leave,' he said, and coughed, doubling over and
almost falling off the bed. Sma went to help him, and pulled him a
little further on to the bed.</p>
<p>
'What can't you say in front of them?' Livueta Zakalwe asked. 'What
don't they know?'</p>
<p>
'I just want to have a... a talk in private, Livvy, please,' he said,
looking up at her. 'Please...'</p>
<p>
'I have nothing to say to you. And there is nothing you can say to
me.'</p>
<p>
The drone heard somebody in the corridor outside; there was a knock
at the door. Livueta opened it. A young female nurse, who called
Livueta Sister, told her that it was time to prepare one of the
patients.</p>
<p>
Livueta Zakalwe looked at her watch. 'I have to go,' she told them.</p>
<p>
'Livvy! Livvy, please!' He leant forward on the bed, both elbows
tight by his sides, both hands clawed out, palm up, in front of him.
'<I>Please</I>!' There were tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>
'This is pointless,' the old woman shook her head. 'And you are a
fool.' She looked at Sma. 'Don't bring him to me again.'</p>
<p>
'LIVVY!' He collapsed on the bed, curled up and quivering. The drone
sensed heat from the shaven head, could see blood vessels throb on
his neck and hands.</p>
<p>
'Cheradenine, it's all right,' Sma said, going to the bed and down on
one knee, taking his shoulders in her hands.</p>
<p>
There was a crack as one of Livueta Zakalwe's hands thumped down into
the top of a table she stood beside. The man wept, shaking. The drone
sensed odd brain-wave patterns. Sma looked up at the woman.</p>
<p>
'Don't call him that,' Livueta Zakalwe said.</p>
<p>
'Don't call him what?' Sma said.</p>
<p>
Sma could be pretty thick, the drone thought.</p>
<p>
'Don't call him Cheradenine.'</p>
<p>
'Why not?'</p>
<p>
'It isn't his name.'</p>
<p>
'It isn't?' Sma looked mystified. The drone monitored the man's brain
activity and blood flow and thought there was trouble coming.</p>
<p>
'No, it isn't.'</p>
<p>
'But...' Sma began. She shook her head suddenly. 'He's your brother;
he's Cheradenine Zakalwe.'</p>
<p>
'No, Ms Sma,' Livueta Zakalwe said, taking the drug-tray up again and
opening the door with one hand. 'No, he isn't.'</p>
<p>
'Aneurysm!' the drone said quickly, and slipped through the air, past
Sma to the bed, where the man was shaking spastically. It scanned him
more thoroughly; found a massive blood vessel leakage pouring into
the man's brain.</p>
<p>
It whirled him round, straightened him out, using its effector to
make him unconscious. Inside his brain, the blood continued to pump
through the tear into the surrounding tissue, invading the cortex.</p>
<p>
'Sorry about this, ladies,' the drone said. It produced a cutting
field and sliced through his skull. He stopped breathing.
Skaffen-Amtiskaw used another aspect of its force field to keep his
chest moving in and out, while its effector gently persuaded the
muscles that opened his lungs to work again. It took the top of his
skull off; a quick low-powered CREW blast, mirrored off another field
component, cauterised all the appropriate blood vessels. It held his
skull to one side. Blood was already visible, welling through the
folded grey geography of the man's brain tissue. His heart stopped;
the drone kept it going with its effector.</p>
<p>
Both women had stopped, fascinated and appalled at the actions of the
machine.</p>
<p>
It stripped away the layers of the man's brain with its own senses;
cortex, limbic, thalamus/cerebellum, it moved through his defences
and armaments, down his thoroughfares and ways, through the stores
and the lands of his memories, searching and mapping and tapping and
searing.</p>
<p>
'What do you mean?' Sma said, in an almost dream-like way to the
elderly woman just about to quit the room. 'What do you mean, &quot;no&quot;?
What do you mean he isn't your brother?'</p>
<p>
'I mean he is not Cheradenine Zakalwe,' Livueta sighed, watching the
drone's bizarre operation upon the man.</p>
<p>
<I>She was... She was... She was...</I></p>
<p>
Sma found herself frowning into the woman's face. 'What? Then...'</p>
<p>
<I>Go back; go right back. What was I to do? Go back. The point is to
win. Go back! Everything must bend to that truth.</I></p>
<p>
'Cheradenine Zakalwe, my brother,' Livueta Zakalwe said, 'died nearly
two hundred years ago. Died not long after he received the bones of
our sister made into a chair.'</p>
<p>
The drone sucked the blood from the man's brain, teasing a hollow
field-filament through the broken tissue, collecting the red fluid in
a little transparent bulb. A second filament tube spun-knit the torn
tissue back together. It sucked more blood to decrease the man's
blood pressure, used its effector to alter the settings in the
appropriate glands, so that the pressure would not grow so great
again for a while. It sent a narrow tube of field over to a small
sink under the window, jetting the excess blood down the drain hole,
then briefly turning on the tap. The blood flushed away, gurgling.</p>
<p>
'The man <I>you</I> know as Cheradenine Zakalwe -'</p>
<p>
<I>Facing it by facing it, that's all I ever did; Staberinde,
Zakalwe; the names hurt, but how else could I-</I></p>
<p>
'- is the man who took my brother's name just as he took my brother's
life, just as he took my sister's life -'</p>
<p>
<I>But she-</I></p>
<p>
'- <I>He</I> was the commander of the <I>Staberinde. He</I> is the
Chairmaker. He is Elethiomel.'</p>
<p>
Livueta Zakalwe walked out, closing the door behind her.</p>
<p>
Sma turned, face almost bloodless, to look at the body of the man
lying on the bed... while Skaffen-Amtiskaw worked on, engrossed in
its struggle to make good.</p>

<p>
Dust, as usual, followed them, though the young man said several
times he thought it might rain. The old man disagreed and said the
clouds over the mountains were deceptive. They drove on through the
deserted lands, past blackened fields and the shells of cottages and
the ruins of farms and the burned villages and the still smoking
towns, until they came to the abandoned city. In the city they drove
resoundingly through the wide empty streets, and once took the
vehicle crashing and careering up a narrow alley crammed with bare
market stalls and rickety poles supporting tattered shade-cloths,
demolishing it all in a fine welter of splintering wood and wildly
flapping fabric.</p>
<p>
They chose the Royal Park as the best place to plant the bomb,
because the troops could be comfortably accommodated in the Park's
wide spaces, and the high command would likely take to the grand
pavilions. The old man thought that they'd want to occupy the Palace,
but the young man was convinced that in their hearts the invaders
were desert people, and would prefer the spaces of the Park to the
clutter of the Citadel.</p>
<p>
So they planted the bomb in the Great Pavilion, and armed it, and
then argued about whether they'd done the right thing. They argued
about where to wait things out, and what to do if the army ignored
the city altogether and just went on by, and whether after the
prospective Event the other armies would retire in terror, or split
up into smaller units to continue the invasion, or know the weapon
used had been unique, and so maintain their steady progress,
doubtless in an even more ruthless spirit of vengeance than before.
They argued about whether the invaders would bombard the city first,
or send in scouts, and - if they did shell - where they would target.
They had a bet on that.</p>
<p>
About the only thing they agreed on was that what they were doing was
a waste of the one nuke their side - indeed either side - possessed,
because even if they had guessed correctly, and the invaders behaved
as they'd anticipated, the most they could hope to do was wipe out
one army, and that would still leave three more, any one of which
could probably complete the invasion. So the warhead, like the lives,
would be wasted.</p>
<p>
They radioed their superiors and with a code-word told them what they
had done. After a little while they received the blessing of the high
command, in the form of another single word. Their masters didn't
really believe the weapon would work.</p>
<p>
The older man was called Cullis, and he won the argument about where
they ought to wait, and so they settled into their high, grand
citadel, and found lots of weapons and wine and got drunk and talked
and told jokes and swapped outrageous stories of derring-do and
conquest, and at one point one of them asked the other what happiness
was, and received a fairly flippant reply, but later neither could
remember which one had asked and which one had answered.</p>
<p>
They slept and they woke and they got drunk again and they told more
jokes and lies, and a light shower of rain blew softly over the city
at one point, and sometimes the young man would move his hand over
his shaved head, through long, thick hair that was not there any
more.</p>
<p>
Still they waited, and when the first shells started to fall they
found they'd picked the wrong place to wait, and so went scrambling
out of it, down the steps and into the courtyard and into the
half-track and then away, out into the desert and the wasteland
beyond, where they camped at dusk and got drunk again and stayed up
specially that night, to watch the flash.</p>

<p>
The path up to the highest cultivation terrace followed an
extravagantly zig-zag route, to allow the wheelchairs to cope with
the gradient. It took him six and a half minutes of hard work to get
to the highest terrace; he was sweating when he got there, but he had
beaten his previous record, and so he was pleased. His breath smoked
in the cold air as he undid the heavy quilted jacket and wheeled the
chair along to one of the raised beds.</p>
<p>
He lifted the basket out of his lap and balanced it on the retaining
wall, took the cutters from his jacket pocket and looked carefully at
the selection of small plants, trying to gauge which cuttings had
fared best since their planting. He hadn't chosen the first one when
some movement up-slope attracted his attention.</p>
<p>
He looked through the high fence, to the dark green forest. The
distant peaks were white against the blue sky above. At first he
thought it was an animal, then the figure moved out of the trees and
walked over the frost-whitened grass towards the gate in the fence.</p>
<p>
The woman opened the gate, closed it behind her; she wore a
thin-looking coat and trousers. He was mildly surprised to see that
she didn't have a rucksack. Perhaps she had walked up through the
grounds of the institute earlier, and was now returning. A visiting
doctor, maybe. He had been going to wave, if she looked at him as she
took the steps down to the institute buildings, but she left the gate
and walked straight towards him. She was tall; dark hair and a light
brown face under a curious looking fur hat.</p>
<p>
'Mr Escoerea,' she said, extending a hand. He put down the cutters,
shook her hand.</p>
<p>
'Good morning, Ms...?'</p>
<p>
She didn't reply, but sat down on the wall, clapped ungloved hands
together, looked around the valley, at the mountains and the forest,
the river, and the institute buildings down-slope. 'How are you, Mr
Escoerea? Are you well?'</p>
<p>
He looked down at what was left of his legs, amputated above the
knees. 'What is left of me is well, ma'am.' It had become his usual
reply. He knew it might sound bitter to some people, but really it
was his way of showing he did not want to pretend that there was
nothing wrong with him.</p>
<p>
She looked at the trousered stumps with a frankness he had only known
before from children. 'It was a tank, wasn't it?'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' he said, taking up the clippers again. 'Tried to trip it up on
the way to Balzeit City; didn't work.' He leant over, took a cutting
and placed it in the basket. He made a note of which plant he'd taken
it from, and attached it to the twig. 'Excuse me...' He moved the
wheelchair along a little, and the woman got out of his way as he
took another cutting.</p>
<p>
She stepped round in front of him again. 'Story I heard said you were
dragging one of your comrades out of its -'</p>
<p>
'Yes,' he interrupted. 'Yes, that's the story. Of course I didn't
know then the price of charity is developing extremely strong arm
muscles.'</p>
<p>
'You get your medal yet?' She squatted down on her haunches, putting
one of her hands on a wheel of his chair. He looked at the hand, then
at her face, but she just grinned.</p>
<p>
He opened his quilted jacket, showed the uniform tunic underneath,
with all its ribbons. 'Yes, I got my medal.' He ignored her hand,
pushed the chair along again.</p>
<p>
The woman rose, squatted down again, beside him. 'Impressive display
for one so young. Surprised you weren't promoted faster; is it true
you didn't show the right attitude to your superiors? That why -'</p>
<p>
He threw the clippers down in the basket, wheeled the chair round to
face her. 'Yeah, lady,' he sneered. 'I said the wrong things, my
family were never very well-connected even when they were alive and
now they're not even that, thanks to the Imperial Glaseen Air Force,
and <I>these</I>...' He clutched at the chest of the tunic, hauling
at the medal ribbons, brandishing them. 'These I'd trade you; all of
them for a pair of shoes I could wear. Now,' he leant forward at her,
took up the clippers. 'I have work to do. There's a guy down in the
institute who stepped on a mine; he hasn't got any legs at all <I>and
</I>he lost an arm. Maybe you'd find it even more fun to go and
patronise him. Excuse me.'</p>
<p>
He whirled the chair around, moved off a few metres, and took a
couple of cuttings, tearing at two plants almost at random. He heard
the woman on the path behind him, and put his hands on the wheels,
pushing himself away.</p>
<p>
She stopped him. Her hand held the back of the wheelchair and she was
stronger than she looked. His arms strained against the wheels; the
rubber buzzed against the stone path, wheels turning but not
propelling him anywhere. He relaxed, looked up at the sky. She came
round in front of him, squatted down again.</p>
<p>
He sighed. 'What exactly do you want, lady?'</p>
<p>
'You, Mr Escoerea.' The woman smiled her beautiful smile. She nodded
at the stumps. 'By the way; the deal with the medals and the shoes;
fair enough.' She shrugged. 'Except you can keep the medals.' She
reached into the basket, took out the clippers and stuck them into
the earth under the plants, then put her hands, clasped, on the front
of the seat. 'Now, Mr Escoerea,' Sma said, shivering. 'How would you
like a proper job?'</p>
