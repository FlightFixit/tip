<h1>Flies</h1>
<h2>by Robert Silverberg</h2>

<p>Here is Cassiday:</p>

<p><i>transfixed on a table</i>.</p>

<p>There wasn't much left of him. A brain-box; a few ropes of nerves; a limb. The sudden implosion had taken care of the rest. There was enough, though. The golden ones didn't need much to go by. They had found him in the wreckage of the drifting ship as it passed through their zone, back of Iapetus. He was alive. He could be repaired. The others on the ship were beyond hope.</p>

<p>Repair him? Of course. Did one need to be human in order to be humanitarian? Repair, yes. By all means. And change. The golden ones were creative.</p>

<p>What was left of Cassiday lay in dry dock on a somewhere table in a golden sphere of force. There was no change of season here; only the sheen of the walls, the unvarying warmth. Neither day nor night, neither yesterday nor tomorrow. Shapes came and went about him. They were regenerating him, stage by stage, as he lay in complete mindless tranquillity. The brain was intact but not functioning. The rest of the man was growing back: tendon and ligament, bone and blood, heart and elbows. Elongated mounds of tissue sprouted tiny buds that enlarged into blobs of flesh. Paste cell to cell together, build a man from his own wreckage—that was no great chore for the golden ones. They had their skills. But they had much to learn, too, and this Cassiday could help them learn it.</p>

<p>Day by day Cassiday grew toward wholeness. They did not awaken him. He lay cradled in warmth, unmoving, unthinking, drifting on the tide. His new flesh was pink and smooth, like a baby's. The epithelial thickening came a little later. Cassiday served as his own blueprint. The golden ones replicated him from a shred of himself, built him back from his own polynucleotide chains, decoded the proteins and reassembled him from the template. An easy task, for them. Why not? Any blob of protoplasm could do it—for itself. The golden ones, who were not protoplasm, could do it for others.</p>

<p>They made some changes in the template. Of course. They were craftsmen. And there was a good deal they wanted to learn.</p>

<p>Look at Cassiday:</p>

<p>Watch them now:</p>

<p><i>changing him</i>.</p>

<p>The complete man lay before them, newly minted, ready for rebirth. Now come the final adjustments. They sought the gray brain within its pink wrapper, and entered it, and traveled through the bays and inlets of the mind, pausing now at this quiet cove, dropping anchor now at the base of that slab-sided cliff. They were operating, but doing it neatly. Here were no submucous resections, no glittering blades carving through gristle and bone, no sizzling lasers at work, no clumsy hammering at the tender meninges. Cold steel did not slash the synapses. The golden ones were subtler; they tuned the circuit that was Cassiday, boosted the gain, damped out the noise, and they did it very gently.</p>

<p>When they were finished with him, he was much more sensitive. He had several new hungers. They had granted him certain abilities.</p>

<p>Now they awakened him.</p>

<p><q>You are alive, Cassiday,</q> a feathery voice said. <q>Your ship was destroyed. Your companions were killed. You alone survived.</q></p>

<p><q>Which hospital is this?</q></p>

<p><q>Not on Earth. You'll be going back soon. Stand up, Cassiday. Move your right hand. Your left. Flex your knees. Inflate your lungs. Open and close your eyes several times. What's your name, Cassiday?</q></p>

<p><q>Richard Henry Cassiday.</q></p>

<p><q>How old?</q></p>

<p><q>Forty-one.</q></p>

<p><q>Look at this reflection. Who do you see?</q></p>

<p><q>Myself.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you have any further questions?</q></p>

<p><q>What did you do to me?</q></p>

<p><q>Repaired you, Cassiday. You were almost entirely destroyed.</q></p>

<p><q>Did you change me any?</q></p>

<p><q>We made you more sensitive to the feelings of your fellow man.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh,</q> said Cassiday.</p>

<p>Follow Cassiday as he journeys:</p>

<p><i>back to Earth</i>.</p>

<p>He arrived on a day that had been programed for snow. Light snow, quickly melting, an aesthetic treat rather than a true manifestation of weather. It was good to touch foot on the homeworld again. The golden ones had deftly arranged his return, putting him back aboard his wrecked ship and giving him enough of a push to get him within range of a distress sweep. The monitors had detected him and picked him up. How was it you survived the disaster unscathed, Spaceman Cassiday? Very simple, sir, I was outside the ship when it happened. It just went swoosh and everybody was killed. And I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>

<p>They routed him to Mars and checked him out, and held him awhile in a decontamination lock on Luna, and finally sent him back to Earth. He stepped into the snowstorm, a big man with a rolling gait and careful calluses in all the right places. He had few friends, no relatives, enough cash units to see him through for a while, and a couple of ex-wives he could look up. Under the rules, he was entitled to a year off with full pay as his disaster allotment. He intended to accept the furlough.</p>

<p>He had not yet begun to make use of his new sensitivity. The golden ones had planned it so that his abilities would remain inoperative until he reached the homeworld. Now he had arrived, and it was time to begin using them, and the endlessly curious creatures who lived back at Iapetus waited patiently while Cassiday sought out those who had once loved him.</p>

<p>He began his quest in Chicago Urban District, because that was where the spaceport was, just outside of Rockford. The slidewalk took him quickly to a travertine tower, festooned with radiant inlays of ebony and violet-hued metal, and there, at the local Televector Central, Cassiday checked out the present whereabouts of his former wives. He was patient about it, a bland-faced, mild-eyed mass of flesh, pushing the right buttons and waiting placidly for the silken contacts to close somewhere in the depths of the earth. Cassiday had never been a violent man. He was calm. He knew how to wait.</p>

<p>The machine told him that Beryl Fraser Cassiday Mellon lived in Boston Urban District. The machine told him that Lureen Holstein Cassiday lived in New York Urban District. The machine told him that Mirabel Gunryk Cassiday Milman Reed lived in San Francisco Urban District.</p>

<p>The names awakened memories: warmth of flesh, scent of hair, touch of hand, sound of voice. Whispers of passion. Snarls of contempt. Gasps of love.</p>

<p>Cassiday, restored to life, went to see his ex-wives.</p>

<p>We find one now:</p>

<p><i>safe and sound</i>.</p>

<p>Beryl Fraser Cassiday Mellon's eyes were milky in the pupil, greenish where they should have been white. She had lost weight in the last ten years, and now her face was parchment stretched over bone, an eroded face, the cheekbones pressing from within against the taut skin and likely to snap through at any moment. Cassiday had been married to her for sixteen months when he was twenty-four. They had separated after she insisted on taking the Sterility Pledge. He had not particularly wanted children, but he was offended by her maneuver all the same. Now she lay in a soothing cradle of webfoam, trying to smile at him without cracking her lips.</p>

<p><q>They said you'd been killed,</q> she told him.</p>

<p><q>I escaped. How have you been, Beryl?</q></p>

<p><q>You can see that. I'm taking the cure.</q></p>

<p><q>Cure?</q></p>

<p><q>I was a triline addict. Can't you see? My eyes, my face? It melted me away. But it was peaceful. Like disconnecting your soul. Only it would have killed me, another year of it. Now I'm on the cure. They tapered me off last month. They're building up my system with prosthetics. I'm full of plastic now. But I'll live.</q></p>

<p><q>You've remarried?</q> Cassiday asked.</p>

<p><q>He split long ago. I've been alone five years. Just me and the triline. But now I'm off that stuff.</q> Beryl blinked, laboriously. <q>You look so relaxed, Dick. But you always were. So calm, so sure of yourself. <i>You'd</i> never get yourself hooked on triline. Hold my hand, will you?</q></p>

<p>He touched the withered claw. He felt the warmth coming from her, the need for love. Great throbbing waves came lalloping into him, low-frequency pulses of yearning that filtered through him and went booming onward to the watchers far away.</p>

<p><q>You once loved me,</q> Beryl said. <q>Then we were both silly. Love me again. Help me get back on my feet. I need your strength.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course I'll help you,</q> Cassidy said.</p>

<p>He left her apartment and purchased three cubes of triline. Returning, he activated one of them and pressed it into Beryl's hand. The green-and-milky eyes roiled in terror.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> she whimpered.</p>

<p>The pain flooding from her shattered soul was exquisite in its intensity. Cassiday accepted the full flood of it. Then she clenched her fist, and the drug entered her metabolism, and she grew peaceful once more.</p>

<p>Observe the next one:</p>

<p><i>with a friend</i>.</p>

<p>The annunciator said, <q>Mr. Cassiday is here.</q></p>

<p><q>Let him enter,</q> replied Mirabel Gunryk Cassiday Milman Reed.</p>

<p>The door-sphincter irised open and Cassiday stepped through, into onyx and marble splendor. Beams of auburn palisander formed a polished wooden framework on which Mirabel lay, and it was obvious that she reveled in the sensation of hard wood against plump flesh. A cascade of crystal-colored hair tumbled to her shoulders. She had been Cassiday's for eight months in 2346, and she had been a slender, timid girl then, but now he could barely detect the outlines of that girl in this pampered mound.</p>

<p><q>You've married well,</q> he observed.</p>

<p><q>Third time lucky,</q> Mirabel said. <q>Sit down? Drink? Shall I adjust the environment?</q></p>

<p><q>It's fine.</q> He remained standing. <q>You always wanted a mansion, Mirabel. My most intellectual wife, you were, but you had this love of comfort. You're comfortable now.</q></p>

<p><q>Very.</q></p>

<p><q>Happy?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm comfortable,</q> Mirabel said. <q>I don't read much any more, but I'm comfortable.</q></p>

<p>Cassiday noticed what seemed to be a blanket crumpled in her lap—purple with golden threads, soft, idle, clinging close. It had several eyes. Mirabel kept her hands spread out over it.</p>

<p><q>From Ganymede?</q> he asked. <q>A pet?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes. My husband bought it for me last year. It's very precious to me.</q></p>

<p><q>Very precious to anybody. I understand they're expensive.</q></p>

<p><q>But lovable,</q> said Mirabel. <q>Almost human. Quite devoted. I suppose you'll think I'm silly, but it's the most important thing in my life now. More than my husband, even. I love it, you see. I'm accustomed to having others love me, but there aren't many things that I've been able to love.</q></p>

<p><q>May I see it?</q> Cassiday said mildly.</p>

<p><q>Be careful.</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly.</q> He gathered up the Ganymedean creature. Its texture was extraordinary, the softest he had ever encountered. Something fluttered apprehensively within the flat body of the animal. Cassiday detected a parallel wariness coming from Mirabel as he handled her pet. He stroked the creature. It throbbed appreciatively. Bands of iridescence shimmered as it contracted in his hands.</p>

<p>She said, <q>What are you doing now, Dick? Still working for the spaceline?</q></p>

<p>He ignored the question. <q>Tell me the line from Shakespeare, Mirabel. About the flies. The flies and wanton boys.</q></p>

<p>Furrows sprouted in her pale brow. <q>It's from <i>Lear</i>,</q> she said. <q>Wait. Yes. ‘<i>As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods. They kill us for their sport</i>.’</q></p>

<p><q>That's the one,</q> Cassiday said. His big hands knotted quickly about the blanket-like being from Ganymede. It turned a dull gray, and reedy fibers popped from its ruptured surface. Cassiday dropped it to the floor. The surge of horror and pain and loss that welled from Mirabel nearly stunned him, but he accepted it and transmitted it.</p>

<p><q>Flies,</q> he explained. <q>Wanton boys. My sport, Mirabel. I'm a god now, did you know that?</q> His voice was calm and cheerful. <q>Good-by. Thank you.</q></p>

<p>One more awaits the visit:</p>

<p><i>swelling with new life</i>.</p>

<p>Lureen Holstein Cassiday, who was thirty-one years old, dark-haired, large-eyed, and seven months pregnant, was the only one of his wives who had not remarried. Her room in New York was small and austere. She had been a chubby girl when she had been Cassiday's two-month wife five years ago, and she was even more chubby now, but how much of the access of new meat was the result of the pregnancy Cassiday did not know.</p>

<p><q>Will you marry now?</q> he asked.</p>

<p>Smiling, she shook her head. <q>I've got money, and I value my independence. I wouldn't let myself get into another deal like the one we had. Not with anyone.</q></p>

<p><q>And the baby? You'll have it?</q></p>

<p>She nodded savagely. <q>I worked hard to get it! You think it's easy? Two years of inseminations! A fortune in fees! Machines poking around in me—all the fertility boosters—oh no, you've got the picture wrong. This isn't an unwanted baby. This is a baby I sweated to have.</q></p>

<p><q>That's interesting,</q> said Cassiday. <q>I visited Mirabel and Beryl, too, and they each had their babies, too. Of sorts. Mirabel had a little beast from Ganymede. Beryl had a triline addiction that she was very proud of shaking. And you've had a baby put into you, without any help from a man. All three of you seeking something. Interesting.</q></p>

<p><q>Are you all right, Dick?</q></p>

<p><q>Fine.</q></p>

<p><q>Your voice is so flat. You're just unrolling a lot of words. It's a little frightening.</q></p>

<p><q>Mmm. Yes. Do you know the kind thing I did for Beryl? I bought her some triline cubes. And I took Mirabel's pet and wrung its—well, not its neck. I did it very calmly. I was never a passionate man.</q></p>

<p><q>I think you've gone crazy, Dick.</q></p>

<p><q>I feel your fear. You think I'm going to do something to your baby. Fear is of no interest, Lureen. But sorrow—yes, that's worth analyzing. Desolation. I want to study it. I want to help <i>them</i> study it. I think it's what they want to know about. Don't run from me, Lureen. I don't want to hurt you, not that way.</q></p>

<p>She was small-bodied and not very strong, and unwieldy in her pregnancy. Cassiday seized her gently by both wrists and drew her toward him. Already he could feel the new emotions coming from her, the self-pity behind the terror, and he had not even done anything to her.</p>

<p>How did you abort a fetus two months from term?</p>

<p>A swift kick in the belly might do it. Too crude, too crude. Yet Cassiday had not come armed with abortifacients, a handy ergot pill, a quick-acting spasmic inducer. So he brought his knee up sharply deploring the crudity of it. Lureen sagged. He kicked her a second time. He remained completely tranquil as he did it, for it would be wrong to take joy in violence. A third kick seemed desirable. Then he released her.</p>

<p>She was still conscious, but she was writhing. Cassiday made himself receptive to the outflow. The child, he realized, was not yet dead within her. Perhaps it might not die at all. But it would certainly be crippled in some way. What he drained from Lureen was the awareness that she might bring forth a defective. The fetus would have to be destroyed. She would have to begin again. It was all quite sad.</p>

<p><q>Why?</q> she muttered. <q>&hellip;why?</q></p>

<p>Among the watchers:</p>

<p><i>the equivalent of dismay</i>.</p>

<p>Somehow it had not developed as the golden ones had anticipated. Even they could miscalculate, it appeared, and they found that a rewarding insight. Still, something had to be done about Cassiday.</p>

<p>They had given him powers. He could detect and transmit to them the raw emotions of others. That was useful to them, for from the data they could perhaps construct an understanding of human beings. But in rendering him a switching center for the emotions of others they had unavoidably been forced to blank out his own. And that was distorting the data.</p>

<p>He was too destructive now, in his joyless way. That had to be corrected. For now he partook too deeply of the nature of the golden ones themselves. <i>They</i> might have their sport with Cassiday, for he owed them a life. But he might not have his sport with others.</p>

<p>They reached down the line of communication to him and gave him his instructions.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> Cassiday said. <q>You're done with me now. There's no need to come back.</q></p>

<p><q>Further adjustments are necessary.</q></p>

<p><q>I disagree.</q></p>

<p><q>You will not disagree for long.</q></p>

<p>Still disagreeing, Cassiday took ship for Mars, unable to stand aside from their command. On Mars he chartered a vessel that regularly made the Saturn run and persuaded it to come in by way of Iapetus. The golden ones took possession of him once he was within their immediate reach.</p>

<p><q>What will you do to me?</q> Cassiday asked.</p>

<p><q>Reverse the flow. You will no longer be sensitive to others. You will report to us on your own emotions. We will restore your conscience, Cassiday.</q></p>

<p>He protested. It was useless.</p>

<p>Within the glowing sphere of golden light they made their adjustments on him. They entered him and altered him, and turned his perceptions inward, so that he might feed on his own misery like a vulture tearing at its entrails. That would be informative. Cassiday objected until he no longer had the power to object, and when his awareness returned it was too late to object.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> he murmured. In the yellow gleam he saw the faces of Beryl and Mirabel and Lureen. <q>You shouldn't have done this to me. You're torturing me &hellip; like you would a fly&hellip;.</q></p>

<p>There was no response. They sent him away, back to Earth. They returned him to the travertine towers and the rumbling slidewalks, to the house of pleasure on 485th Street, to the islands of light that blazed in the sky, to the eleven billion people. They turned him loose to go among them, and suffer, and report on his sufferings. And a time would come when they would release him, but not yet.</p>

<p>Here is Cassiday:</p>

<p><i>nailed to his cross</i>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Afterword:</p>

<p>One of the first science fiction stories I wrote was a deadly grim portrayal of a New York compelled into cannibalism. It was sufficiently realistic so that no one would buy it for four years, and only an inspired promotion job by the editor of this present anthology got it into print at all.</p>

<p>Now, twelve or thirteen years later, I've turned from the literal depiction of cannibalism to the symbolic presentation of vampirism, which I suppose indicates a healthy progression of morbidity. Every writer returns to his own obsessions when given a free hand, and every situation he invents, no matter how grotesque, says something about the nature of human relationships. If I seem to be saying that we devour each other, literally or figuratively, that we drain substance from one another, that we practice vampirism and cannibalism, so be it. Beneath any grotesquerie lies its opposite; behind the grimness of cannibalism lies the video sentimentality, <q>People need people.</q> To devour, if nothing else.</p>

<p>No apologies offered. No excuses. Just a story, a made-up fiction, a fantasy about future times and other worlds. Nothing more than that.</p>
