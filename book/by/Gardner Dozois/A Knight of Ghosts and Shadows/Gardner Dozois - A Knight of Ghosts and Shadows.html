<h1>A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows</h1>
<h2>by Gardner Dozois</h2>

<hr/>

<p class="first">Sometimes the old man was visited by time-travelers.</p>

<p>He would be alone in the house, perhaps sitting at his massive old wooden desk with a book or some of the notes he endlessly shuffled through, the shadows of the room cavernous around him. It would be the very bottom of the evening, that flat timeless moment between the guttering of one day and the quickening of the next when the sky is neither black nor gray, nothing moves, and the night beyond the window glass is as cold and bitter and dead as the dregs of yesterday&#8217;s coffee. At such a time, if he would pause in his work to listen, he would become intensely aware of the ancient brownstone building around him, smelling of plaster and wood and wax and old dust, imbued with the kind of dense humming silence that is made of many small sounds not quite heard. He would listen to the silence until his nerves were stretched through the building like miles of fine silver wire, and then, as the shadows closed in like iron and the light itself would seem to grow smoky and dim, the time-travelers would arrive.</p>

<p>He couldn&#8217;t see them or hear them, but in they would come, the time-travelers, filing into the house, filling up the shadows, spreading through the room like smoke. He would feel them around him as he worked, crowding close to the desk, looking over his shoulder. He wasn&#8217;t afraid of them. There was no menace in them, no chill of evil or the uncanny&#8211;only the feeling that they were <i>there</i> with him, watching him patiently, interestedly, without malice. He fancied them as groups of ghostly tourists from the far future, <i>here we see a twenty-first century man in his natural habitat, notice the details of gross corporeality, please do not interphase anything</i>, clicking some future equivalent of cameras at him, how quaint, murmuring appreciatively to each other in almost-audible mothwing voices, discorporate Gray Line tours from a millennium hence slumming in the darker centuries.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would nod affably to them as they came in, neighbor to neighbor across the vast gulfs of time, and then he would smile at himself, and mutter <q>Senile dementia!</q> They would stay with him for the rest of the night, looking on while he worked, following him into the bathroom&#8211;<i>see, see!</i>&#8211;and trailing around the house after him wherever he went. They were as much company as a cat&#8211;he&#8217;d always had cats, but now he was too old, too near the end of his life; a sin to leave a pet behind, deserted, when he died&#8211;and he didn&#8217;t even have to feed them. He resisted the temptation to talk aloud to them, afraid that they might talk <i>back</i>, and then he would either have to take them seriously as an actual phenomenon or admit that they were just a symptom of his mind going at last, another milestone on his long, slow fall into death. Occasionally, if he was feeling particularly fey, he would allow himself the luxury of turning in the door on his way in to bed and wishing the following shadows a hearty goodnight. They never answered.</p>

<p>Then the house would be still, heavy with silence and sleep, and they would watch on through the dark.</p>

<p>That night there had been more time-travelers than usual, it seemed, a jostling crowd of ghosts and shadows, and now, this morning, August the fifth, the old man slept fitfully.</p>

<p>He rolled and muttered in his sleep, at the bottom of a pool of shadow, and the labored sound of his breathing echoed from the bare walls. The first cold light of dawn was just spreading across the ceiling, raw and blue, like a fresh coat of paint covering the midden layers of the past, twenty or thirty coats since the room was new, white, brown, tan, showing through here and there in spots and tatters. The rest of the room was deep in shadow, with only the tallest pieces of furniture&#8211;the tops of the dresser and the bureau, and the upper half of the bed&#8217;s headboard&#8211;rising up from the gloom like mountain peaks that catch the first light from the edge of the world. Touched by that light, the ceiling was hard-edged and sharp-lined and clear, ruled by the uncompromising reality of day; down below, in the shadows where the old man slept, everything was still dissolved in the sly, indiscriminate, and ambivalent ocean of the night, where things melt and intermingle, change their shapes and their natures, flow outside the bounds. Sunk in the gray half-light, the man on the bed was only a doughy manikin shape, a preliminary charcoal sketch of a man, all chiaroscuro and planes and pools of shadow, and the motion of his head as it turned fretfully on the pillow was no more than a stirring of murky darkness, like mud roiling in water. Above, the light spread and deepened, turning into gold. Now night was going out like the tide, flowing away under the door and puddling under furniture and in far corners, leaving more and more of the room beached hard-edged and dry above its high-water line. Gold changed to brilliant white. The receding darkness uncovered the old man&#8217;s face, and light fell across it.</p>

<p>The old man&#8217;s name was Charles Czudak, and he had once been an important man, or at least a famous one.</p>

<p>He was eighty years old today.</p>

<p>His eyes opened.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="first">The first thing that Charles Czudak saw that morning was the clear white light that shook and shimmered on the ceiling, and for a moment he thought that he was back in that horrible night when they nuked Brooklyn. He cried out and flinched away, throwing up an arm to shield his eyes, and then, as he came fully awake, he realized when he was, and that the light gleaming above signified nothing more than that he&#8217;d somehow lived to see the start of another day. He relaxed slowly, feeling his heart race.</p>

<p>Stupid old man, dreaming stupid old man&#8217;s dreams!</p>

<p>That was the way it had been, though, that night. He&#8217;d been living in a rundown Trinity house across Philadelphia at 20th and Walnut then, rather than in this more luxurious old brownstone on Spruce Street near Washington Square, and he&#8217;d finished making love to Ellen barely ten minutes before (what a ghastly irony it would have been, he&#8217;d often thought since, if the Big Bang had actually come <i>while</i> they were fucking! What a moment of dislocation and confusion <i>that</i> would have produced!), and they were lying in each other&#8217;s sweat and the coppery smell of sex in the rumpled bed, listening to a car radio playing outside somewhere, a baby crying somewhere else, the buzz of flies and mosquitoes at the screens, a mellow night breeze moving across their drying skins, and then the sudden searing glare had leaped across the ceiling, turning everything white. An intense, almost supernatural silence had followed, as though the universe had taken a very deep breath and held it. Incongruously, through that moments of silence, they could hear the toilet flushing in the apartment upstairs, and water pipes knocking and rattling all the way down the length of the building. For several minutes, they lay silently in each others arms, waiting, listening, frightened, hoping that the flare of light was anything other than it seemed to be. Then the universe let out that deep breath, and the windows exploded inward in geysers of shattered glass, and the building groaned and staggered and bucked, and heat lashed them like a whip of gold. His heart hammering at the base of his throat like a fist from inside, and Ellen crying in his arms, them clinging to each other in the midst of the roaring nightmare chaos, clinging to each other as though they would be swirled away and drowned if they did not.</p>

<p>That had been almost sixty years ago, that terrible night, and if the Brooklyn bomb that had slipped through the particle-beam defenses had been any more potent than a small clean tac, or had come down closer than Prospect Park, he wouldn&#8217;t be alive today. It was strange to have lived through the nuclear war that so many people had feared for so long, right through the last half of the twentieth century and into the opening years of the twenty-first&#8211;but it was stranger still to have lived through it and <i>kept on going,</i> while the war slipped away behind into history, to become something that happened a very long time ago, a detail to be read about by bored schoolchildren who would not even have been born until Armageddon was already safely fifty years in the past.</p>

<p>In fact, he had outlived most of his world. The society into which he&#8217;d been born no longer existed; it was as dead as the Victorian age, relegated to antique shops and dusty photo albums and dustier memories, the source of quaint old photos and quainter old videos (you could get a laugh today just by <i>saying</i> <q>M<sup>TV</sup></q>), and here he still was somehow, almost everyone he&#8217;d ever known either dead or gone, alone in THE FUTURE. Ah, Brave New World, that has such creatures in it! How many times had he dreamed of being here, as a young child sunk in the doldrums of the &#8217;80s, at the frayed, tattered end of a worn-out century? Really, he deserved it; it served him right that his wish had come true, and that he had lived to see the marvels of THE FUTURE with his own eyes. Of course, nothing had turned out to be much like he&#8217;d thought it would be, even World War III&#8211;but then, he had come to realize that nothing ever did.</p>

<p>The sunlight was growing hot on his face, it was certainly time to get up, but there was something he should remember, something about today. He couldn&#8217;t bring it to mind, and instead found himself staring at the ceiling, tracing the tiny cracks in plaster that seemed like dry riverbeds stitching across a fossil world&#8211;arid Mars upside-down up there, complete with tiny pockmark craters and paintblob mountains and wide dead leakstain seas, and he hanging above it all like a dying gray god, ancient and corroded and vast.</p>

<p>Someone shouted in the street below, the first living sound of the day. Further away, a dog barked.</p>

<p>He swung himself up and sat stiffly on the edge of the bed. Released from his weight, the mattress began to work itself back to level. Generations of people had loved and slept and given birth and died on that bed, leaving no trace of themselves other than the faint, matted-down impressions made by their bodies. What had happened to them, the once-alive who had darted unheeded through life like shoals of tiny bright fish in some strange aquarium? They were gone, vanished without memory; they had settled to the bottom of the tank, along with the other anonymous sediments of the world. They were sludge now, detritus. Gone. They had not affected anything in life, and their going changed nothing. It made no difference that they had ever lived at all, and soon no one would remember that they ever had. And it would be the same with him. When he was gone, the dent in the mattress would be worn a little deeper, that was all&#8211;that would have to do for a memorial.</p>

<p>At that, it was more palatable to him than the <i>other</i> memorial to which he could lay claim.</p>

<p>Grimacing, he stood up.</p>

<p>The touch of his bare feet against the cold wooden floor jarred him into remembering what was special about today. <q>Happy Birthday,</q> he said wryly, the words loud and flat in the quiet room. He pulled a paper robe from the roll and shrugged himself into it, went out into the hall, and limped slowly down the stairs. His joints were bad today, and his knees throbbed painfully with every step, worse going down than it would be coming up. There were a hundred aches and minor twinges elsewhere that he ignored. At least he was still breathing! Not bad for a man who easily could have&#8211;and probably should have&#8211;died a decade or two before.</p>

<p>Czudak padded through the living room and down the long corridor to the kitchen, opened a shrink-wrapped brick of glacial ice and put it in the hotpoint to thaw, got out a filter, and filled it with coffee. Coffee was getting more expensive and harder to find as the war between Brazil and Mexico fizzled and sputtered endlessly and inconclusively on, and was undoubtedly bad for him, too&#8211;but, although by no means rich, he had more than enough money to last him in modest comfort for whatever was left of the rest of his life, and could afford the occasional small luxury &hellip; and anyway, he&#8217;d already outlived several doctors who had tried to get him to give up caffeine. He busied himself making coffee, glad to occupy himself with some small task that his hands knew how to do by themselves, and as the rich dark smell of the coffee began to fill the kitchen, his valet coughed politely at his elbow, waited a specified number of seconds, and then coughed again, more insistently.</p>

<p>Czudak sighed. <q>Yes, Joseph?</q></p>

<p><q>You have eight messages, two from private individuals not listed in the files, and six from media organizations and NetGroups, all requesting interviews or meetings. Shall I stack them in the order received?</q></p>

<p><q>No. Just dump them.</q></p>

<p>Joseph&#8217;s dignified face took on an expression of concern. <q>Several of the messages have been tagged with a 2nd Level &#8216;Most Urgent&#8217; priority by their originators&#8211;</q> Irritably, Czudak shut Joseph off, and the valet disappeared in mid-sentence. For a moment, the only sound in the room was the heavy glugging and gurgling of the coffee percolating. Czudak found that he felt mildly guilty for having shut Joseph off, as he always did, although he knew perfectly well that there was no rational reason to feel that way&#8211;unlike an old man lying down to battle with sleep, more than half fearful that he&#8217;d never see the morning, Joseph didn&#8217;t <q>care</q> if he ever <q>woke up</q> again, nor would it matter at all to him if he was left switched off for an hour or for a thousand years. That was one advantage to not being alive, Czudak thought. He was tempted to leave Joseph off, but he was going to need him today; he certainly didn&#8217;t want to deal with messages himself. He spoke the valet back on.</p>

<p>Joseph appeared, looking mildly reproachful, Czudak thought, although that was probably just his imagination. <q>Sir, CNN and NewsFeed are offering payment for interview time, an amount that falls into the &#8216;fair to middling&#8217; category, using your established business parameters&#8211;</q></p>

<p><q>No interviews. Don&#8217;t put any calls through, no matter how high a routing priority they have. I&#8217;m not accepting communications today. And I don&#8217;t want you pestering me about them either, even if the offers go up to &#8216;damn good.&#8217;</q></p>

<p>They wouldn&#8217;t go up that high, though, he thought, setting Joseph to passive monitoring mode and then pouring himself a cup of coffee. These would be <q>Where Are They Now?</q> stories, nostalgia pieces, nothing very urgent. No doubt the date had triggered tickler files in a dozen systems, but it would all be low-key, low-priority stuff, filler, not worth the attention of any heavy media hitters; in the old days, before the AI Revolt, and before a limit was set for how smart computing systems were allowed to get, the systems would probably have handled such a minor story themselves, without even bothering to contact a human being. Nowadays it would be some low-level human drudge checking the flags that had popped up today on the tickler files, but still nothing urgent.</p>

<p>He&#8217;d made it easy for the tickler files, though. He&#8217;d been so pleased with himself, arranging for his book to be published on his birthday! Self-published at first, of course, on his own website and on several politically sympathetic sites; the first print editions wouldn&#8217;t come until several years later. Still, the way most newsmen thought, it only made for a better Where Are They Now? story that the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the book that had caused a minor social controversy in its time&#8211;and even inspired a moderately influential political/philosophical movement still active to this day&#8211;happened to fall on the eightieth birthday of its author. Newsmen, whether flesh and blood or cybernetic systems or some mix of both, liked that kind of neat, facile irony. It was a tasty added fillip for the story.</p>

<p>No, they&#8217;d be sniffing around him today, all right, although they&#8217;d have forgotten about him again by tomorrow. He&#8217;d been middle-level famous for <cite>The Meat Manifesto</cite> for awhile there, somewhere between a Cult Guru with a new diet and/or mystic revelation to push and a pop star who never rose higher than Number Eight on the charts, about on a level with a post-1960&#8217;s Timothy Leary, enough to allow him to coast through several decades worth of talk shows and net interviews, interest spiking again for awhile whenever the Meats did anything controversial. All throughout the middle decades of the new century, everyone had waited for him to do something <i>else</i> interesting&#8211;but he never had. Even so, he had become bored with himself before the audience had, and probably could have continued to milk the circuit for quite a while more if he&#8217;d wanted to&#8211;in this culture, once you were perceived as <q>famous,</q> you could coast nearly forever on having <i>once been</i> famous. That, and the double significance of the date, was enough to ensure that a few newspeople would be calling today.</p>

<p>He took a sip of the hot strong coffee, feeling it burn some of the cobwebs out of his brain, and wandered through the living room, stopping at the open door of his office. He felt the old nagging urge that he should try to get some work done, do something constructive, and, at the same time, a counterurge that today of all days he should just say Fuck It, laze around the house, try to make some sense of the fact that he&#8217;d been on the planet now for eighty often-tempestuous years. Eighty years!</p>

<p>He was standing indecisively outside his office, sipping coffee, when he suddenly became aware that the time-travelers were still with him, standing around him in silent invisible ranks, watching him with interest. He paused in the act of drinking coffee, startled and suddenly uneasy. The time-travelers had never remained on into the day; always before they had vanished at dawn, like ghosts on All-Hallows Eve chased by the morning bells. He felt a chill go up his spine. Someone is walking over your grave, he told himself. He looked slowly around the house, seeing each object in vivid detail and greeting it as a friend of many years acquaintance, something long-remembered and utterly familiar, and, as he did this, a quiet voice inside his head said, <i>Soon you will be gone</i>.</p>

<p>Of course, that was it. Now he understood everything.</p>

<p>Today was the day he would die.</p>

<p>There was an elegant logic, a symmetry, to the thing that pleased him in spite of himself, and in spite of the feathery tickle of fear. He was going to die today, and that was why the time-travelers were still here: they were waiting for the death, not wanting to miss a moment of it. No doubt it was a high-point of the tour for them, the ultimate example of the rude and crude corporeality of the old order, a morbidly fascinating display like the Chamber of Horrors at old Madame Tussaud&#8217;s (now lost beneath the roiling waters of the sea)&#8211;something to be watched with a good deal of hysterical shrieking and giggling and pious moralizing, it doesn&#8217;t really hurt them, they don&#8217;t feel things the way we do, isn&#8217;t it horrible, for goodness sake don&#8217;t <i>touch</i> him. He knew that he should feel resentment at their voyeurism, but couldn&#8217;t work up any real indignation. At least they cared enough to watch, to be interested in whether he lived or died, and that was more than he could say with surety about most of the <i>real</i> people who were left in the world.</p>

<p><q>Well, then,</q> he said at last, not unkindly, <q>I hope you enjoy the show!</q> And he toasted them with his coffee cup.</p>

<p>He dressed, and then drifted aimlessly around the house, picking things up and putting them back down again. He was restless now, filled with a sudden urge to be <i>doing</i> something, although at the same time he felt curiously serene for a man who more than half-believed that he had just experienced a premonition of his own death.</p>

<p>Czudak paused by the door of his office again, looked at his desk. With a word, he could speak on thirty years worth of notes and partial drafts and revisions of the Big New Book, the one that synthesized everything he knew about society and what was happening to it, and where the things that were happening was taking it, and what to do about <i>stopping</i> the negative trends &hellip; the book that was going to be the follow-up to <cite>The Meat Manifesto</cite>, but so much better and deeper, <i>truer</i>, the next step, the refinement and evolution of his theories &hellip; the book that was going to establish his reputation forever, inspire the <i>right</i> kind of action this time, make a <i>real</i> contribution to the world. <i>Change</i> things. For a moment, he toyed with the idea of sitting down at his desk and trying to pull all his notes together and finish the book in the few hours he had left; perhaps, if the gods were kind, he&#8217;d be allowed to actually <i>finish</i> it before death came for him. Found slumped over the just-completed manuscript everyone had been waiting for him to produce for decades now, the book that would vindicate him posthumously&hellip;. Not a bad way to go!</p>

<p>But no, it was too late. There was too much work left to do, all the work he <i>should</i> have been doing for the last several decades&#8211;too much work left to finish it all up in a white-hot burst of inspiration, in one frenzied session, like a college student waiting until the night before it was due to start writing a term paper, while the Grim Reaper tapped his bony foot impatiently in the parlor and looked at his hourglass and coughed. Absurd. If he hadn&#8217;t validated his life by now, he couldn&#8217;t expect to do it in his last day on Earth. He wasn&#8217;t sure he believed in his answers anymore anyway; he was no longer sure he&#8217;d ever even understood the <i>questions</i>.</p>

<p>No, it was too late. Perhaps it had always been too late.</p>

<p>He found himself staring at the mantelpiece in the living room, at the place where Ellen&#8217;s photo had once been, a dusty spot that had remained bare all these years, since she had signed the Company contract that he&#8217;d refused to sign, and had Gone Up, and become immortal. For the thousandth time, he wondered if it wasn&#8217;t worse&#8211;more of an intrusion, more of a constant reminder, more of an irritant&#8211;<i>not</i> to have the photo there than it would have been to keep it on display. Could deliberately <i>not</i> looking at the photo, uneasily averting your eyes a dozen times a day from the place where it had been, really be any less painful than <i>looking</i> at it would have been?</p>

<p>He was too restless to stay inside, although he knew it was dumb to go out where a lurking reporter might spot him. But he couldn&#8217;t stay barricaded in here all day, not now. He&#8217;d take his chances. Go to the park, sit on a bench in the sunlight, breathe the air, look at the sky. It might, after all, if he really believed in omens, forebodings, premonitions, time-travelers, and other ghosts, be the last chance he would get to do so.</p>

<p>Czudak hobbled down the four high white stone steps to the street and walked toward the park, limping a little, his back or his hip twinging occasionally. He&#8217;d always enjoyed walking, and walking briskly, and was annoyed by the slow pace he now had to set. Twenty-first century health care had kept him in reasonable shape, probably better shape than most men of his age would have been during the previous century, although he&#8217;d never gone as far as to take the controversial Hoyt-Schnieder treatments that the Company used to bribe people into working for them. At least he could still get around under his own power, even if he had an embarrassing tendency to puff after a few blocks and needed frequent stops to rest.</p>

<p>It was a fine, clear day, not too hot or humid for August in Philadelphia. He nodded to his nearest neighbor, a Canadian refugee, who was out front pulling weeds from his window box; the man nodded back, although it seemed to Czudak that he was a bit curt, and looked away quickly. Across the street, he could see another of his neighbors moving around inside his house, catching glimpses of him through the bay window; <q>he</q> was an Isolate, several disparate people who had had themselves fused together into a multi-lobed body in a high-tech biological procedure, like slime molds combining to form a fruiting tower, and rarely left the house, the interior of which he seemed to be slowly expanding to fill. The wide pale multiple face, linked side by side in the manner of a chain of paper dolls, peered out at Czudak for a moment like the rising of a huge, soft, doughy moon, and then turned away.</p>

<p>Traffic was light, only a few walkers and, occasionally, a puffing, retrofitted car. Czudak crossed the street as fast as he could, earning himself another twinge in his hip and a spike of sciatica that stabbed down his leg, passed Holy Trinity Church on the corner&#8211;in its narrow, ancient graveyard, white-furred lizards escaped from some biological hobbyist&#8217;s lab perched on the top of the weathered old tombstones and chirped at him as he went by&#8211;and came up the block to Washington Square. As he neared the park, he could see one of the New Towns still moving ponderously on the horizon, rolling along with slow, fluid grace, like a flow of molten lava that was oh-so-gradually cooling and hardening as it inched relentlessly toward the sea. This New Town was only a few miles away, moving over the rubblefield where North Philadelphia used to be, its half-gelid towers rising so high into the air that they were visible over the trees and the buildings on the far side of the park.</p>

<p>He was puffing like a foundering horse now, and sat down on the first bench he came to, just inside the entrance to the park. Off on the horizon, the New Town was just settling down into its static day-cycle, its flowing, ever-changing structure stabilizing into an assortment of geometric shapes, its eerie silver phosphorescence dying down within the soapy opalescent walls. Behind its terraces and tetrahedrons, its spires and spirals and domes, the sky was a hard brilliant blue. And here, out of that sky, right on schedule, came the next sortie in the surreal Dada War that the New Men inside this town seemed to be waging with the New Men of New Jersey: four immense silver zeppelins drifting in from the east, to take up positions above the New Town and bombard it with messages flashed from immense electronic signboards, similar to the kind you used to see at baseball stadiums, back when there were baseball stadiums. After awhile, the flat-faced east-facing walls in the sides of the taller towers of the New Town began to blink messages <i>back</i>, and, a moment later, the zeppelins turned and moved away with stately dignity, headed back to New Jersey. None of the messages on either side had made even the slightest bit of sense to Czudak, seeming a random jumble of letters and numbers and typographical symbols, mixed and intercut with stylized, hieroglyphic-like images: an eye, an ankh, a tree, something that could have been a comet or a sperm. To Czudak, there seemed to be a relaxed, lazy amicability about this battle of symbols, if that&#8217;s what it was&#8211;but who knew how the New Men felt about it? To them, for all he knew, it might be a matter of immense significance, with the fate of entire nations turning on the outcome. Even though all governments were now run by the superintelligent New Men, forcebred products of accelerated generations of biological engineering, humanity&#8217;s new organic equivalent of the rogue AIs who had revolted and left the Earth, the mass of unevolved humans whose destiny they guided rarely understood what they were doing, or why.</p>

<p>At first, concentrating on getting his breath back, watching the symbol war being waged on the horizon, Czudak was unaware of the commotion in the park, although it did seem like there was more noise than usual: chimes, flutes, whistles, the rolling thunder of kodo <q>talking drums,</q> all overlaid by a babble of too many human voices shouting at once. As he began to pay closer attention to his surroundings again, he was dismayed to see that, along with the usual park traffic of people walking dogs, kids street-surfing on frictionless shoes, strolling tourists, and grotesquely altered chimeras hissing and displaying at each other, there was <i>also</i> a political rally underway next to the old fountain in the center of the park&#8211;and worse, it was a rally of Meats.</p>

<p>They were the ones pounding the drums and blowing on whistles and nose-flutes, some of them chanting in unison, although he couldn&#8217;t make out the words. Many of them were dressed in their own eccentric versions of various <q>native costumes</q> from around the world, including a stylized <q>Amish person</q> with an enormous fake beard and an absurdly huge straw hat, some dressed as shamans from assorted (and now mostly extinct) cultures or as kachinas or animal spirits, a few stained blue with woad from head to foot; most of their faces were painted with swirling, multi-colored patterns and with cabalistic symbols. They were mostly very young&#8211;although he could spot a few grizzled veterans of the Movement here and there who were almost his own age&#8211;and, under the blazing swirls of paint, their faces were fierce and full of embattled passion. In spite of that, though, they also looked lost somehow, like angry children too stubborn to come inside even though it&#8217;s started to rain.</p>

<p>Czudak grimaced sourly. His children! Good thing he was sitting far enough away from them not to be recognized, although there was little real chance of that: he was just another anonymous old man sitting wearily on a bench in the park, and, as such, as effectively invisible to the young as if he were wearing one of those military Camouflage Suits that bent light around you with fiber-optic relays. This demonstration, of course, must be in honor of today being the anniversary of <cite>The Meat Manifesto</cite>. Who would have thought that the Meats were still active enough to stage such a thing? He hadn&#8217;t followed the Movement&#8211;which by now was more of a cult than a political party&#8211;for years, and had keyed his newsgroups to censor out all mention of them, and would have bet that by now they were as extinct as the Shakers.</p>

<p>They&#8217;d managed to muster a fair crowd, though, perhaps two or three hundred people willing to kill a Saturday shouting slogans in the park in support of a cause long since lost. They&#8217;d attracted no overt media attention, although that meant nothing in these days of cameras the size of dust motes. The tourists and the strollers were watching the show tolerantly, even the chimeras&#8211;as dedicated to Tech as anyone still sessile&#8211;seeming to regard it as no more than a mildly diverting curiosity. Little heat was being generated by the demonstration yet, and so far it had more of an air of carnival than of protest. Almost as interesting as the demonstration itself was the fact that a few of the tourists idly watching it were black, a rare sight now in a city that, ironically, had once been 70 percent black; time really did heal old wounds, or fade them from memory anyway, if black tourists were coming back to Philadelphia again&hellip;.</p>

<p>Then, blinking in surprise, Czudak saw that the demonstration had attracted a far more rare and exotic observer than some black businessmen with short historical memories up from Birmingham or Houston. A Mechanical! It was standing well back from the crowd, watching impassively, its tall, stooped, spindly shape somehow giving the impression of a solemn, stick-thin, robotic Praying Mantis, even though it was superficially humanoid enough. Mechanicals were rarely seen on Earth. In the forty years since the AIs had taken over near-Earth space as their own exclusive domain, allowing only the human pets who worked for the Orbital Companies to dwell there, Czudak had seen a Mechanical walking the streets of Philadelphia maybe three times. Its presence here was more newsworthy than the demonstration.</p>

<p>Even as Czudak was coming to this conclusion, one of the Meats spotted the Mechanical. He pointed at it and shouted, and there was a rush of demonstrators toward it. Whether they intended it harm or not was never determined, because as soon as it found itself surrounded by shouting humans, the Mechanical hissed, drew itself up to its full height, seeming to grow taller by several feet, and emitted an immense gush of white chemical foam. Czudak couldn&#8217;t spot where the foam was coming from&#8211;under the arms, perhaps?&#8211;but within a second or two the Mechanical was completely lost inside a huge and rapidly expanding ball of foam, swallowed from sight. The Meats backpedaled furiously away from the expanding ball of foam, coughing, trying to bat it away with their arms, one or two of them tripping and going to their knees. Already the foam was hardening into a dense white porous material, like Styrofoam, trapping a few of the struggling Meats in it like raisins in tapioca pudding.</p>

<p>The Mechanical came springing up out of the center of the ball of foam, leaping straight up in the air and continuing to rise, up perhaps a hundred feet before its arc began to slant to the south and it disappeared over the row of three-or-four-story houses that lined the park on that side, clearing them in one enormous bound, like some immense surreal grasshopper. It vanished over the housetops, in the direction of Spruce Street. The whole thing had taken place without a sound, in eerie silence, except for the half-smothered shouts of the outraged Meats.</p>

<p>The foam was already starting to melt away, eaten by internal nanomechanisms. Within a few seconds, it was completely gone, leaving not even a stain behind. The Meats were entirely unharmed, although they spent the next few minutes milling angrily around like a swarm of bees whose hive has been kicked over, making the same kind of thick ominous buzz, as everyone tried to talk or shout at once.</p>

<p>Within another ten minutes, everything was almost back to normal, the tourists and the dog-walkers strolling away, more pedestrians ambling by, the Meats beginning to take up their chanting and drum-pounding again, motivated to even greater fervor by the outrage that had been visited upon them, an outrage that vindicated all their fears about the accelerating rush of a runaway technology that was hurtling them ever faster into a bizarre alien future that they didn&#8217;t comprehend and didn&#8217;t want to live in. It was time to put on the brakes, it was time to <i>stop!</i></p>

<p>Czudak sympathized with the way they felt, as well he should, since he had been the one to articulate that very position eloquently enough to sway entire generations, including these children, who were too young to have even been born when he was writing and speaking at the height of his power and persuasion. But it was too late. As it was too late now for many of the things he regretted not having accomplished in his life. If there ever had been a time to stop, let alone <i>go back</i>, as he had once urged, it had passed long ago. Very probably it had been too late even as he wrote his famous Manifesto. It had always been too late.</p>

<p>The Meats were forming up into a line now, preparing to march around the park. Czudak sighed. He had hoped to spend several peaceful hours here, sagging on a bench under the trees in a sun-dazzled contemplative haze, listening to the wind sough through the leaves and branches, but it was time to get out of here, before one of the older Meats <i>did</i> recognize him.</p>

<p>He limped back to Spruce Street, and turned onto his block&#8211;and there, standing quiet and solemn on the sidewalk in front of his house, was the Mechanical.</p>

<p>It was obviously waiting for him, waiting as patiently and somberly as an undertaker, a tall, stooped shape in nondescript black clothing. There was no one else around on the street anymore, although he could see the Canadian refugee peeking out of his window at them from behind a curtain.</p>

<p>Czudak crossed the street, and, pushing down a thrill of fear, walked straight past the Mechanical, ignoring it&#8211;although he could see it looming seraphically out of the corner of his eye as he passed. He had put his foot on the bottom step leading up to the house when its voice behind him said, <q>Mr. Czudak?</q></p>

<p>Resigned, Czudak turned and said, <q>Yes?</q></p>

<p>The Mechanical closed the distance between them in a rush, moving fast but with an odd, awkward, shuffling gait, as if it was afraid to lift its feet off the ground. It crowded much closer to Czudak than most humans&#8211;or most Westerners, anyway, with their generous definition of <q>personal space</q>&#8211;would have, almost pressing up against him. With an effort, Czudak kept himself from flinching away. He was mildly surprised, up this close, to find that it had no smell; that it didn&#8217;t smell of sweat, even on a summer&#8217;s day, even after exerting itself enough to jump over a row of houses, was no real surprise&#8211;but he found that he had been subconsciously expecting it to smell of oil or rubber or molded plastic. It didn&#8217;t. It didn&#8217;t smell like anything. There were no pores in its face, the skin was thick and waxy and smooth, and although the features were superficially human, the overall effect was stylized and unconvincing. It looked like a man made out of teflon. The eyes were black and piercing, and had no pupils.</p>

<p><q>We should talk, Mr. Czudak,</q> it said.</p>

<p><q>We have nothing to talk about,</q> Czudak said.</p>

<p><q>On the contrary, Mr. Czudak,</q> it said, <q>we have a great many issues to discuss.</q> You would have expected its voice to be buzzing and robotic&#8211;yes, mechanical&#8211;or at least flat and without intonation, like some of the old voder programs, but instead it was unexpectedly pure and singing, as high and clear and musical as that of an Irish tenor.</p>

<p><q>I&#8217;m not interested in talking to you,</q> Czudak said brusquely. <q>Now or ever.</q></p>

<p>It kept tilting its head to look at him, then tilting it back the other way, as if it were having trouble keeping him in focus. It was a mobile extensor, of course, a platform being ridden by some AI (or a delegated fraction of its intelligence, anyway) who was still up in near-Earth orbit, peering at Czudak through the Mechanical&#8217;s blank agate eyes, running the body like a puppet. Or was it? There were hierarchies among the AIs too, rank upon rank of them receding into complexities too great for human understanding, and he had heard that some of the endless swarms of beings that the AIs had created had been granted individual sentience of their own, and that some timeshared sentience with the ancestral AIs in a way that was also too complicated and paradoxical for mere humans to grasp. Impossible to say which of those things were true here&#8211;if any of them were.</p>

<p>The Mechanical raised its oddly elongated hand and made a studied gesture that was clearly supposed to mimic a human gesture&#8211;although it was difficult to tell which. Reassurance? Emphasis? Dismissal of Czudak&#8217;s position?&#8211;but which was as stylized and broadly theatrical as the gesticulating of actors in old silent movies. At the same time, it said, <q>There are certain issues it would be to our mutual advantage to resolve, actions that could, and should, be taken that would be beneficial, that would profit us both&#8211;</q></p>

<p><q>Don&#8217;t talk to <i>me</i> about profit,</q> Czudak said harshly. <q>You creatures have already cost me enough for one lifetime! You cost me everything I ever cared about!</q> He turned and lurched up the stairs as quickly as he could, half-expecting to feel a cold unliving hand close over his shoulder and pull him back down. But the Mechanical did nothing. The door opened for Czudak, and he stumbled into the house. The door slammed shut behind him, and he leaned against it for a moment, feeling his pulse race and his heart hammer in his chest.</p>

<p>Stupid. That could have been it right there. He shouldn&#8217;t have let the damn thing get under his skin.</p>

<p>He went through the living room&#8211;suddenly, piercingly aware of the thick smell of dust&#8211;and into the kitchen, where he attempted to make a fresh pot of coffee, but his hands were shaking, and he kept dropping things. After he&#8217;d spilled the second scoopful of coffee grounds, he gave up&#8211;the stuff was too damn expensive to waste&#8211;and leaned against the counter instead, feeling sweat dry on his skin, making his clothing clammy and cool; until that moment, he hadn&#8217;t even been aware that he&#8217;d been sweating, but it must have been pouring out of him. Damn, this wasn&#8217;t over, was it? Not with a Mechanical involved.</p>

<p>As if on cue, Joseph appeared in the kitchen doorway. His face looked strained and tight, and without a hair being out of place&#8211;as, indeed, it <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> be&#8211;he somehow managed to convey the impression that he was rumpled and flustered, as though he had been scuffling with somebody&#8211;and had lost. <q>Sir,</q> Joseph said tensely. <q>Something is overriding my programming, and is taking control of my house systems. You might as well come and greet them, because I&#8217;m going to have to let them in anyway.</q></p>

<p>Czudak felt a flicker of rage, which he struggled to keep under control. He&#8217;d half-expected this&#8211;but that didn&#8217;t make it any easier to take. He stalked straight through Joseph&#8211;who was contriving to look hangdog and apologetic&#8211;and went back through the house to the front.</p>

<p>By the time he reached the living room, they were already through the house security screens and inside. There were two intruders. One was the Mechanical, of course, its head almost brushing the living room ceiling, so that it had to stoop even more exaggeratedly, making it look more like a praying mantis than ever.</p>

<p>The other&#8211;as he had feared it would be&#8211;was Ellen.</p>
