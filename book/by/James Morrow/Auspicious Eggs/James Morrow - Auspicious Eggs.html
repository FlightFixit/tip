<h1>Auspicious Eggs</h1>
<h2>by James Morrow</h2>

<p>One of the grand themes in literature is how we decide the fates of those who can't help themselves. Through the lens of an alternative history, lames Morrow now focuses on that question with powerful results &mdash; and along the way, he shares with us something about the secret hostilities of the saints.</p>

<p>Mr. Morrow's witty novels and stories include This Is the Way the World Ends, City of Truth, and Only Begotten Daughter. He recently published the final volume of his God-is-dead trilogy, The Eternal Footman, and he is working on a novel about the birth of the scientific point of view entitled The Last Witchfinder. He has also dabbled with amateur theater recently, including a one-act play entitled <q>The Zombies of Montrose.</q></p>

<hr/>

<p><span class="start">Father Cornelius Dennis</span> Monaghan of Charlestown Parish, Connie to his friends, sets down the styrofoam chalice, turns from the corrugated cardboard altar, and approaches the two women standing by the resin baptismal font. The font is six-sided and encrusted with saints, like a gigantic hex nut forged for some obscure yet holy purpose, but its most impressive feature is its portability. Hardly a month passes in which Connie doesn't drive the vessel across town, bear it into some wretched hovel, and confer immortality on a newborn whose parents have grown too feeble to leave home.</p>

<p><q>Merribell, right?</q> asks Connie, pointing to the baby on his left.</p>

<p>Wedged in the crook of her mother's arm, the infant wriggles and howls. <q>No &mdash; Madelaine,</q> Angela mumbles. Connie has known Angela Dunfey all her life, and he still remembers the seraphic glow that beamed from her face when she first received the Sacrament of Holy Communion. Today she boasts no such glow. Her cheeks and brow appear tarnished, like iron corroded by the Greenhouse Deluge, and her spine curls with a torsion more commonly seen in women three times her age. <q>Merribell's over here.</q> Angela raises her free hand and gestures toward her cousin Lorna, who is balancing Madelaine's twin sister atop her gravid belly. Will Lorna Dunfey, Connie wonders, also give birth to twins? The phenomenon, he has heard, runs in families.</p>

<p>Touching the sleeve of Angela's frayed blue sweater, the priest addresses her in a voice that travels clear across the nave. <q>Have these children received the Sacrament of Reproductive Potential Assessment?</q></p>

<p>The parishioner shifts a nugget of chewing gum from her left cheek to her right. <q>Y-yes,</q> she says at last.</p>

<p>Henry Shaw, the pale altar boy, his face abloom with acne, hands the priest a parchment sheet stamped with the Seal of the Boston Isle Archdiocese. A pair of signatures adorns the margin, verifying that two ecclesiastical representatives have legitimized the birth. Connie instantly recognizes the illegible hand of Archbishop Xallibos. Below lie the bold loops and assured serifs of a Friar James Wolfe, M.D., doubtless the man who drew the blood.</p>

<p>Madelaine Dunfey, Connie reads. Left ovary: 315 primordial follicles. Right ovary: 340 primordial follicles. A spasm of despair passes through the priest. The egg-cell count for each organ should be 180,000 at least. It's a verdict of infertility, no possible appeal, no imaginable reprieve.</p>

<p>With an efficiency bordering on effrontery, Henry Shaw offers Connie a second parchment sheet.</p>

<p>Merribell Dun fey. Left ovary: 290 primordial follicles. Right ovary: 310 primordial follicles. The priest is not surprised. What sense would there be in God's withholding the power of procreation from one twin but not the other? Connie now needs only to receive these barren sisters, apply the sacred rites, and furtively pray that the Fourth Lateran Council was indeed guided by the Holy Spirit when it undertook to bring the baptismal process into the age of testable destinies and ovarian surveillance.</p>

<p>He holds out his hands, withered palms up, a posture he maintains as Angela surrenders Madelaine, reaches under the baby's christening gown, and unhooks both diaper pins. The mossy odor of fresh urine wafts into the Church of the Immediate Conception. Sighing profoundly, Angela hands the sopping diaper to her cousin.</p>

<p><q>Bless these waters, O Lord,</q> says Connie, spotting his ancient face in the baptismal fluid, <q>that they might grant these sinners the gift of life everlasting.</q> Turning from the font, he presents Madelaine to his ragged flock, over three hundred natural-born Catholics &mdash; sixth-generation Irish, mostly, plus a smattering of Portuguese, Italians, and Croats &mdash; interspersed with two dozen recent converts of Korean and Vietnamese extraction: a congregation bound together, he'll admit, less by religious conviction than by shared destitution. <q>Dearly beloved, forasmuch as all humans enter the world in a state of depravity, and forasmuch as they cannot know the grace of our Lord except they be born anew of water, I beseech you to call upon God the Father that, through these baptisms, Madelaine and Merribell Dunfey may gain the divine kingdom.</q> Connie faces his trembling parishioner. <q>Angela Dunfey, do you believe, by God's word, that children who are baptized, dying before they commit any actual evil, will be saved?</q></p>

<p>Her <q>Yes</q> is begrudging and clipped.</p>

<p>Like a scrivener replenishing his pen at an inkwell, Connie dips his thumb into the font. <q>Angela Dunfey, name this child of yours.</q></p>

<p><q>M-M-Madelaine Eileen Dunfey.</q></p>

<p><q>We welcome this sinner, Madelaine Eileen Dunfey, into the mystical body of Christ</q> &mdash; with his wet thumb Connie traces a plus sign on the infant's forehead &mdash; <q>and do mark her with the Sign of the Cross.</q></p>

<p>Unraveling Madelaine from her christening gown, Connie fixes on the waters. They are preternaturally still &mdash; as calm and quiet as the Sea of Galilee after the Savior rebuked the winds. For many years the priest wondered why Christ hadn't returned on the eve of the Greenhouse Deluge, dispersing the hydrocarbon vapors with a wave of his hand, ending global warming with a Heavenward wink, but recently Connie has come to feel that divine intervention entails protocols past human ken.</p>

<p>He contemplates his reflected countenance. Nothing about it &mdash; not the tiny eyes, thin lips, hawk's beak of a nose &mdash; pleases him. Now he begins the immersion, sinking Madelaine Dunfey to her skullcap &hellip; her ears cheeks &hellip; mouth &hellip; eyes.</p>

<p><q>No!</q> screams Angela.</p>

<p>As the baby's nose goes under, mute cries spurt from her lips: bubbles inflated with bewilderment and pain. <q>Madelaine Dunfey,</q> Connie intones, holding the infant down, <q>I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</q> The bubbles break the surface. The fluid pours into the infant's lungs. Her silent screams cease, but she still puts up a fight.</p>

<p><q>No! Please! No!</q></p>

<p>A full minute passes, marked by the rhythmic shuffling of the congregation and the choked sobs of the mother. A second minute &mdash; a third &mdash; and finally the body stops moving, a mere husk, no longer home to Madelaine Dunfey's indestructible soul.</p>

<p><q>No!</q></p>

<p>The Sacrament of Terminal Baptism, Connie knows, is rooted in both logic and history. Even today, he can recite verbatim the preamble to the Fourth Lateran Council's Pastoral Letter on the Rights of the Unconceived. (<q>Throughout her early years, Holy Mother Church tirelessly defended the Rights of the Born. Then, as the iniquitous institution of abortion spread across Western Europe and North America, she undertook to secure the Rights of the Unborn. Now, as a new era dawns for the Church and her servants, she must make even greater efforts to propagate the gift of life everlasting, championing the Rights of the Unconceived through a Doctrine of Affirmative Fertility.</q>) The subsequent sentence has always given Connie pause. It stopped him when he was a seminarian. It stops him today. (<q>This Council therefore avers that, during a period such as that in which we find ourselves, when God has elected to discipline our species through a Greenhouse Deluge and its concomitant privations, a society can commit no greater crime against the future than to squander provender on individuals congenitally incapable of procreation.</q>) Quite so. Indeed. And yet Connie has never performed a terminal baptism without misgivings.</p>

<p>He scans the faithful. Valerie Gallogher, his nephews' zaftig kindergarten teacher, seems on the verge of tears. Keye Sung frowns. Teresa Curtoni shudders. Michael Hines moans softly. Stephen O'Rourke and his wife both wince.</p>

<p><q>We give thanks, most merciful Father</q> &mdash; Connie lifts the corpse from the water &mdash; <q>that it pleases you to regenerate this infant and take her unto your bosom.</q> Placing the dripping flesh on the altar, he leans toward Lorna Dunfey and lays his palm on Merribell's brow. <q>Angela Dunfey, name this child of yours.</q></p>

<p><q>M-M-Merribell S-Siobhan &hellip;</q> With a sharp reptilian hiss, Angela wrests Merribell from her cousin and pulls the infant to her breast. <q>Merribell Siobhan Dunfey!</q></p>

<p>The priest steps forward, caressing the wisp of tawny hair sprouting from Merribell's cranium. <q>We welcome this sinner&mdash;</q></p>

<p>Angela whirls around and, still sheltering her baby, leaps from the podium to the aisle &mdash; the very aisle down which Connie hopes one day to see her parade in prelude to receiving the Sacrament of Qualified Monogamy.</p>

<p><q>Stop!</q> cries Connie.</p>

<p><q>Angela!</q> shouts Lorna.</p>

<p><q>No!</q> yells the altar boy.</p>

<p>For someone who has recently given birth to twins, Angela is amazingly spry, rushing pell-mell past the stupefied congregation and straight through the narthex.</p>

<p><q>Please!</q> screams Connie.</p>

<p>But already she is out the door, bearing her unsaved daughter into the teeming streets of Boston Isle.</p>

<p>AT 8:17 P.M., Eastern Standard Time, Stephen O'Rourke's fertility reaches its weekly peak. The dial on his wrist tells him so, buzzing like a tortured hornet as he scrubs his teeth with baking soda. Skreee, says the sperm counter, reminding Stephen of his ineluctable duty. Skreee, skreee: go find us an egg.</p>

<p>He pauses in the middle of a brush stroke and, without bothering to rinse his mouth, strides into the bedroom.</p>

<p>Kate lies on the sagging mattress, smoking an unfiltered cigarette as she balances her nightly dose of iced Arbutus rum on her stomach. Baby Malcolm cuddles against his mother, gums fastened onto her left nipple. She stares at the far wall, where the cracked and scabrous plaster frames the video monitor, its screen displaying the regular Sunday night broadcast of Keep Those Kiddies Coming. Archbishop Xallibos, seated, dominates a TV studio appointed like a day-care center: stuffed animals, changing table, brightly colored alphabet letters. Preschoolers crawl across thc prelate's Falstaffian body, sliding down his thighs and swinging from his arms as if he's a piece of playground equipment.</p>

<p><q>Did you know that a single act of onanism kills up to four hundred million babies in a matter of seconds?</q> asks Xallibos from the monitor. <q>As Jesus remarks in the Gospel According to Saint Andrew, 'Masturbation is murder.'</q></p>

<p>Stephen coughs. <q>I don't suppose you're &hellip;</q></p>

<p>His wife thrusts her index finger against her pursed lips. Even when engaged in shutting him out, she still looks beautiful to Stephen. Her huge eyes and high cheekbones, her elegant swanlike neck. <q>Shhh &mdash; </q></p>

<p><q>Please check,</q> says Stephen, swallowing baking soda.</p>

<p>Kate raises her bony wrist and glances at her ovulation gauge. <q>Not for three days. Maybe four.</q></p>

<p><q>Damn.</q></p>

<p>He loves her so dearly. He wants her so much &mdash; no less now than when they received the Sacrament of Qualified Monogamy. It's fine to have a connubial conversation, but when you utterly adore your wife, when you crave to comprehend her beyond all others, you need to speak in flesh as well.</p>

<p><q>Will anyone deny that Hell's hottest quadrant is reserved for those who violate the rights of the unconceived?</q> asks Xallibos, playing peeka-boo with a cherubic toddler. <q>Who will dispute that contraception, casual sex, and nocturnal emissions place their perpetrators on a one-way cruise to Perdition?</q></p>

<p><q>Honey, I have to ask you something,</q> says Stephen.</p>

<p><q>Shhh &mdash; </q></p>

<p><q>That young woman at Mass this morning, the one who ran away &hellip; .</q></p>

<p><q>She went crazy because it was twins.</q> Kate slurps down her remaining rum. The ice fragments clink against each other. <q>If it'd been just the one, she probably could've coped.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, yes, of course,</q> says Stephen, gesturing toward Baby Malcolm. <q>But suppose one of your newborns&hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>Heaven is forever, Stephen,</q> says Kate, filling her mouth with ice, <q>and Hell is just as long.</q> She chews, her molars grinding the ice. Dribbles of rum-tinted water spill from her lips. <q>You'd better get to church.</q></p>

<p><q>Farewell, friends,</q> says Xallibos as the theme music swells. He dandles a Korean three-year-old on his knee. <q>And keep those kiddies coming!</q></p>

<p>The path to the front door takes Stephen through the cramped and fetid living room &mdash; functionally the nursery. All is quiet, all is well. The fourteen children, one for every other year of Kate's post-menarche, sleep soundly. Nine-year-old Roger is quite likely his, product of the time Stephen and Kate got their cycles in synch; the boy boasts Stephen's curly blond hair and riveting green eyes. Difficult as it is, Stephen refuses to accord Roger any special treatment &mdash; no private trips to the frog pond, no second candy cane at Christmas. A good stepfather didn't indulge in favoritism.</p>

<p>Stephen pulls on his mended galoshes, fingerless gloves, and torn pea jacket. Ambling out of the apartment, he joins the knot of morose pedestrians as they shuffle along Winthrop Street. A fog descends, a steady rain falls: reverberations from the Deluge. Pushed by expectant mothers, dozens of shabby, black-hooded baby buggies squeak mournfully down the asphalt. The sidewalks belong to adolescent girls, gang after gang, gossiping among themselves and stomping on puddles as they show off their pregnancies like Olympic medals.</p>

<p>Besmirched by two decades of wind and drizzle, a limestone Madonna stands outside the Church of the Immediate Conception. Her expression lies somewhere between a smile and a smirk. Stephen climbs the steps, enters the narthex, removes his gloves, and, dipping his fingertips into the nearest font, decorates the air with the Sign of the Cross.</p>

<p>Every city, Stephen teaches his students at Cardinal Dougherty High School, boasts its own personality. Extroverted Rio, pessimistic Prague, paranoid New York. And Boston Isle? What sort of psyche inhabits the Hub and its surrounding reefs? Schizoid, Stephen tells them. Split. The Boston that battled slavery and stoked the fires beneath the American melting pot was the same Boston that massacred the Pequots and sent witchfinders to Salem. But here, now, which side of the city is emergent? The bright one, Stephen decides, picturing the hundreds of Heaven-bound souls who each day exit Boston's innumerable wombs, flowing forth like the bubbles that so recently streamed from Madelaine Dunfey's lips.</p>

<p>Blessing the Virgin's name, he descends the concrete stairs to the copulatorium. A hundred votive candles pierce the darkness. The briny scent of incipient immortality suffuses the air. In the far corner, a CD player screeches out the Apostolic Succession doing their famous rendition of <q>Ave Maria.</q></p>

<p>The Sacrament of Extramarital Intercourse has always reminded Stephen of a junior high prom. Girls strung along one side of the room, boys along the other, gyrating couples in the center. He takes his place in the line of males, removes his jacket, shirt, trousers, and underclothes, and hangs them on the nearest pegs. He stares through the gloom, locking eyes with Roger's old kindergarten teacher, Valerie Gallogher, a robust thirtyish woman whose incandescent red hair spills all the way to her hips. Grimly they saunter toward each other, following the pathway formed by the mattresses, until they meet amid the morass of writhing soulmakers.</p>

<p><q>You're Roger Mulcanny's stepfather, aren't you?</q> asks the ovulating teacher.</p>

<p><q>Father, quite possibly. Stephen O'Rourke. And you're Miss Gallogher, right?</q></p>

<p><q>Call me Valerie.</q></p>

<p><q>Stephen.</q></p>

<p>He glances around, noting to his infinite relief that he recognizes no one. Sooner or later, he knows, a familiar young face will appear at the copulatorium, a notion that never fails to make him wince. How could he possibly explicate the Boston Massacre to a boy who'd recently beheld him in the procreative act? How could he render the Battle of Lexington lucid to a girl whose egg he'd attempted to quicken the previous night?</p>

<p>For ten minutes he and Valerie make small talk, most of it issuing from Stephen, as was proper. Should the coming sacrament prove fruitful, the resultant child will want to know about the handful of men with whom his mother connected during the relevant ovulation. (Beatrice, Claude, Tommy, Laura, Yolanda, Willy, and the others were forever grilling Kate for facts about their possible progenitors.) Stephen tells Valerie about the time his students gave him a surprise birthday party. He describes his rock collection. He mentions his skill at trapping the singularly elusive species of rat that inhabits Charlestown Parish.</p>

<p><q>I have a talent too,</q> says Valerie, inserting a coppery braid into her mouth. Her areolas seem to be staring at him.</p>

<p><q>Roger thought you were a terrific teacher.</q></p>

<p><q>No &mdash; something else.</q> Valerie tugs absently on her ovulation gauge. <q>A person twitches his lips a certain way, and I know what he's feeling. He darts his eyes in an odd manner &mdash; I sense the drift of his thoughts.</q> She lowers her voice. <q>I watched you during the baptism this morning. Your reaction would've angered the archbishop &mdash; am I right?</q></p>

<p>Stephen looks at his bare toes. Odd that a copulatorium partner should be demanding such intimacy of him.</p>

<p><q>Am I?</q> Valerie persists, sliding her index finger along her large, concave bellybutton.</p>

<p>Fear rushes through Stephen. Does this woman work for the Immortality Corps? If his answer smacks of heresy, will she arrest him on the spot?</p>

<p><q>Well, Stephen? Would the archbishop have been angry?</q></p>

<p><q>Perhaps,</q> he confesses. In his mind he sees Madelaine Dunfey's submerged mouth, bubble following bubble like beads strung along a rosary.</p>

<p><q>There's no microphone in my navel,</q> Valerie asserts, alluding to a common Immortality Corps ploy. <q>I'm not a spy.</q></p>

<p><q>Never said you were.</q></p>

<p><q>You were thinking it. I could tell by the cant of your eyebrows.</q> She kisses him on the mouth, deeply, wetly. <q>Did Roger ever learn to hold his pencil correctly?</q></p>

<p><q>'Fraid not.</q></p>

<p><q>Too bad.</q></p>

<p>At last the mattress to Stephen's left becomes free, and they climb on top and begin reifying the Doctrine of Affirmative Fertility. The candle flames look like spear points. Stephen closes his eyes, but the effect is merely to intensify the fact that he's here. The liquid squeal of flesh against flesh grows louder, the odor of hot paraffin and warm semen more pungent. For a few seconds he manages to convince himself that the woman beneath him is Kate, but the illusion proves as tenuous as the surrounding wax.</p>

<p>When the sacrament is accomplished, Valerie says, <q>I have something for you. A gift.</q></p>

<p><q>What's the occasion?</q></p>

<p><q>Saint Patrick's Day is less than a week away.</q></p>

<p><q>Since when is that a time for gifts?</q></p>

<p>Instead of answering, she strolls to her side of the room, rummages through her tangled garments, and returns holding a pressed flower sealed in plastic.</p>

<p><q>Think of it as a ticket,</q> she whispers, lifting Stephen's shirt from its peg and slipping the blossom inside the pocket.</p>

<p><q>To where?</q></p>

<p>Valerie holds an erect index finger to her lips. <q>We'll know when we get there.</q></p>

<p>Stephen gulps audibly. Sweat collects beneath his sperm counter. Only fools consider fleeing Boston Isle. Only lunatics risk the retributions meted out by the Corps. Displayed every Sunday night on Keep Those Kiddies Coming, the classic images &mdash; men submitting to sperm siphons, women locked in the rapacious embrace of artificial inseminators haunt every parishioner's imagination, instilling the same levels of dread as Spinelli's sculpture of the archangel Chamuel strangling David Hume. There were rumors, of course, unconfirmable accounts of parishioners who've outmaneuvered the patrol boats and escaped to Quebec Cay, Seattle Reef, or the Texas Archipelago. But to credit such tales was itself a kind of sin, jeopardizing your slot in Paradise as surely as if you'd denied the unconceived their rights.</p>

<p><q>Tell me something, Stephen.</q> Valerie straps herself into her bra. <q>You're a history teacher. Did Saint Patrick really drive the snakes out of Ireland, or is that just a legend?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm sure it never happened literally,</q> says Stephen. <q>I suppose it could be true in some mythic sense.</q></p>

<p><q>It's about penises, isn't it?</q> says Valerie, dissolving into the darkness. <q>It's about how our saints have always been hostile to cocks.</q></p>

<p>ALTHOUGH HARBOR Authority Tower was designed to house the merchant-shipping aristocracy on whose ambitions the decrepit Boston economy still depended, the building's form, Connie now realizes, perfectly fits its new, supplemental function: sheltering the offices, courts, and archives of the archdiocese. As he lifts his gaze along the soaring facade, Connie thinks of sacred shapes &mdash; of steeples and vaulted windows, of Sinai and Zion, of Jacob's Ladder and hands pressed together in prayer. Perhaps it's all as God wants, he muses, flashing his ecclesiastical pass to the guard. Perhaps there's nothing wrong with commerce and grace being transacted within the same walls.</p>

<p>Connie has seen Archbishop Xallibos in person only once before, five years earlier, when the stately prelate appeared as an <q>honorary Irishman</q> in Charlestown Parish's annual Saint Patrick's Day Parade. Standing on the sidewalk, Connie observed Xallibos gliding down Lynde Street atop a huge motorized shamrock. The archbishop looked impressive then, and he looks impressive now &mdash; six foot four at least, Connie calculates, and not an ounce under three hundred pounds. His eyes are as red as a lab rat's.</p>

<p><q>Father Cornelius Dennis Monaghan,</q> the priest begins, following the custom whereby a visitor to an archbishop's chambers initiates the interview by naming himself.</p>

<p><q>Come forward, Father Cornelius Dennis Monaghan.</q></p>

<p>Connie starts into the office, boots clacking on the polished bronze floor. Xallibos steps from behind his desk, a glistery cube of black marble.</p>

<p><q>Charlestown Parish holds a special place in my affections,</q> says the archbishop. <q>What brings you to this part of town?</q></p>

<p>Connie fidgets, shifting first left, then right, until his face lies mirrored in the hubcap-size Saint Cyril medallion adorning Xallibos's chest. <q>My soul is in torment, Your Grace.</q></p>

<p><q>'Torment.' Weighty word.</q></p>

<p><q>I can find no other. Last Tuesday I laid a two-week-old infant to rest.</q></p>

<p><q>Terminal baptism?</q></p>

<p>Connie ponders his reflection. It is wrinkled and deflated, like a helium balloon purchased at a carnival long gone. <q>My eighth.</q></p>

<p><q>I know how you feel. After I dispatched my first infertile &mdash; no left testicle, right one shriveled beyond repair &mdash; I got no sleep for a week.</q> Eyes glowing like molten rubies, Xallibos stares directly at Connie. <q>Where did you attend seminary?</q></p>

<p><q>Isle of Denver.</q></p>

<p><q>And on the Isle of Denver did they teach you that there are in fact two Churches, one invisible and eternal, the other &mdash; </q></p>

<p><q>Temporal and finite.</q></p>

<p><q>Then they also taught you that the latter Church is empowered to revise its sacraments according to the imperatives of the age.</q> The archbishop's stare grows brighter, hotter, purer. <q>Do you doubt that present privations compel us to arrange early immortality for those who cannot secure the rights of the unconceived?</q></p>

<p><q>The problem is that the infant I immortalized has a twin.</q> Connie swallows nervously. <q>Her mother stole her away before I could perform the second baptism.</q></p>

<p><q>Stole her away?</q></p>

<p><q>She fled in the middle of the sacrament.</q></p>

<p><q>And the second child is likewise arid?</q></p>

<p><q>Left ovary, two hundred ninety primordials. Right ovary, three hundred ten.</q></p>

<p><q>Lord &hellip;</q> A high whistle issues from the archbishop, like water vapor escaping a tea kettle. <q>Does she intend to quit the island?</q></p>

<p><q>I certainly hope not, Your Grace,</q> says the priest, wincing at the thought. <q>She probably has no immediate plans beyond protecting her baby and trying to &mdash;</q></p>

<p>Connie cuts himself off, intimidated by the sudden arrival of a roly-poly man in a white hooded robe.</p>

<p><q>Friar James Wolfe, M.D.,</q> says the monk.</p>

<p><q>Come forward, Friar Doctor James Wolfe,</q> says Xallibos.</p>

<p><q>It would be well if you validated this posthaste.</q> James Wolfe draws a parchment sheet from his robe and lays it on the archbishop's desk. Connie steals a glance at the report, hoping to learn the baby's fertility quotient, but the relevant statistics are too faint. <q>The priest in question, he's celebrating Mass in</q> &mdash; sliding a loose sleeve upward, James Wolfe consults his wristwatch &mdash; <q>less than an hour. He's all the way over in Brookline.</q></p>

<p>Striding back to his desk, the archbishop yanks a silver fountain pen from its holder and decorates the parchment with his famous spidery signature.</p>

<p><q>Dominus vobiscum, Friar Doctor Wolfe,</q> he says, handing over the document.</p>

<p>As Wolfe rushes out of the office, Xallibos steps so close to Connie that his nostrils fill with the archbishop's lemon-scented aftershave lotion.</p>

<p><q>That man never has any fun,</q> says Xallibos, pointing toward the vanishing friar. <q>What fun do you have, Father Monaghan?</q></p>

<p><q>Fun, Your Grace?</q></p>

<p><q>Do you eat ice cream? Follow the fortunes of the Celtics?</q> He pronounces <q>Celtics</q> with the hard C mandated by the Third Lateran Council.</p>

<p>Connie inhales a hearty quantity of citrus fumes. <q>I bake.</q></p>

<p><q>Bake? Bake what? Bread?</q></p>

<p><q>Cookies, Your Grace. Brownies, cheesecake, pies. For the Feast of the Nativity, I make gingerbread magi.</q></p>

<p><q>Wonderful. I like my priests to have fun. Listen, no matter what, the rite must be performed. If Angela Dunfey won't come to you, then you must go to her.</q></p>

<p><q>She'll simply run away again.</q></p>

<p><q>Perhaps so, perhaps not. I have great faith in you, Father Cornelius Dennis Monaghan.</q></p>

<p><q>More than I have in myself,</q> says the priest, biting his inner cheeks so hard that his eyes fill with tears.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> says Kate for the third time that night.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> insists Stephen, savoring the dual satisfactions of Kate's thigh beneath his palm and Arbutus rum washing through his brain.</p>

<p>Pinching her cigarette in one hand, Kate strokes Baby Malcolm's forehead with the other, lulling him to sleep. <q>It's wicked,</q> she protests as she places Malcolm on the rug beside the bed. <q>A crime against the future.</q></p>

<p>Stephen grabs the Arbutus bottle, pours himself another glass, and, adding a measure of Dr. Pepper, takes a greedy gulp. He sets the bottle back on the nightstand, next to Valerie Gallogher's enigmatic flower.</p>

<p><q>Screw the unconceived,</q> he says, throwing himself atop his wife.</p>

<p>On Friday he'd shown the blossom to Gall Whittington, Dougherty High School's smartest science teacher, but her verdict proved unenlightening. Epigaea repens, <q>trailing arbutus,</q> a species with at least two claims to fame: it is the state flower of the Massachusetts Archipelago, and it has lent its name to the very brand of alcohol Stephen now consumes.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> says Kate once again. She drops her cigarette on the floor, crushes it with her shoe, and wraps her arms around him. <q>I'm not ovulating,</q> she avers, forcing her stiff and slippery tongue inside his mouth. <q>Your sperm aren't &hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>Last night, the Holy Father received a vision,</q> Xallibos announces from the video monitor. <q>Pictures straight from Satan's flaming domain. Hell is a fact, friends. It's as real as a stubbed toe.</q></p>

<p>Stephen whips off Kate's chemise with all the dexterity of Father Monaghan removing a christening gown. The rum, of course, has much to do with their mutual willingness (four glasses each, only mildly diluted with Dr. Pepper), but beyond the Arbutus the two of them have truly earned this moment. Neither has ever skipped Mass. Neither has ever missed a Sacrament of Extramarital Intercourse. And while any act of nonconceptual love technically lies beyond the Church's powers of absolution, surely Christ will forgive them a solitary lapse. And so they go at it, this sterile union, this forbidden fruitlessness, this coupling from which no soul can come.</p>

<p><q>Hedonists dissolving in vats of molten sulfur,</q> says Xallibos.</p>

<p>The bedroom door squeals open. One of Kate's middle children, Beatrice, a gaunt six-year-old with flaking skin, enters holding a rude toy boat whittled from a hunk of bark.</p>

<p><q>Look what I made in school yesterday!</q></p>

<p><q>We're busy,</q> says Kate, pulling the tattered muslin sheet over her nakedness.</p>

<p><q>Do you like my boat, Stephen?</q> asks Beatrice.</p>

<p>He slams a pillow atop his groin. <q>Lovely, dear.</q></p>

<p><q>Go back to bed,</q> Kate commands her daughter.</p>

<p><q>Onanists drowning in lakes of boiling semen,</q> says Xallibos.</p>

<p>Beatrice fixes Stephen with her receding eyes. <q>Can we sail it tomorrow on Parson's Pond?</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly. Of course. Please go away.</q></p>

<p><q>Just you and me, right, Stephen? Not Claude or Tommy or Yolanda or anybody.</q></p>

<p><q>Flaying machines,</q> says Xallibos, <q>peeling the damned like ripe bananas.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you want a spanking?</q> seethes Kate. <q>That's exactly what you're going to get, young lady, the worst spanking of your whole life!</q></p>

<p>The child issues an elaborate shrug and strides off in a huff.</p>

<p><q>I love you,</q> Stephen tells his wife, removing the pillow from his privates like a chef lifting the lid from a stew pot.</p>

<p>Again they press together, throwing all they have into it, every limb and gland and orifice, no holds barred, no positions banned.</p>

<p><q>Unpardonable,</q> Kate groans.</p>

<p><q>Unpardonable,</q> Stephen agrees. He's never been so excited. His entire body is an appendage to his loins.</p>

<p><q>We'll be damned,</q> she says.</p>

<p><q>Forever,</q> he echoes.</p>

<p><q>Kiss me,</q> she commands.</p>

<p><q>Farewell, friends,</q> says Xallibos. <q>And keep those kiddies coming!</q></p>

<p>WRESTLING THE resin baptismal font from the trunk of his car, Connie ponders the vessel's resemblance to a birdbath &mdash; a place, he muses, for pious sparrows to accomplish their avian ablutions. As he sets the vessel on his shoulder and starts away, its edges digging into his flesh, a different metaphor suggests itself. But if the font is Connie's Cross, and Constitution Road his Via Dolorosa, where does that leave his upcoming mission to Angela Dunfey? Is he about to perform some mysterious act of vicarious atonement?</p>

<p><q>Morning, Father.</q></p>

<p>He slips the font from his shoulder, standing it upright beside a fire hydrant. His parishioner Valerie Gallogher weaves amid the mob, dressed in a threadbare woolen parka.</p>

<p><q>Far to go?</q> she asks brightly.</p>

<p><q>End of the block.</q></p>

<p><q>Want help?</q></p>

<p><q>I need the exercise.</q></p>

<p>Valerie extends her arm and they shake hands, mitten clinging to mitten. <q>Made any special plans for Saint Patrick's Day?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm going to bake shamrock cookies.</q></p>

<p><q>Green?</q></p>

<p><q>Can't afford food coloring.</q></p>

<p><q>I think I've got some green &mdash; you're welcome to it. Who's at the end of the block?</q></p>

<p><q>Angela Dunfey.</q></p>

<p>A shadow flits across Valerie's face. <q>And her daughter?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> moans Connie. His throat constricts. <q>Her daughter.</q></p>

<p>Valerie lays a sympathetic hand on his arm. <q>If I don't have green, we can probably fake it.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, Valerie, Valerie &mdash; I wish I'd never taken Holy Orders.</q></p>

<p><q>We'll mix yellow with orange. I'm sorry, Father.</q></p>

<p><q>I wish this cup would pass.</q></p>

<p><q>I mean yellow with blue.</q></p>

<p>Connie loops his arms around the font, embracing it as he might a frightened child. <q>Stay with me.</q></p>

<p>Together they walk through the serrated March air and, reaching the Warren Avenue intersection, enter the tumble-down pile of bricks labeled No. 47. The foyer is as dim as a crypt. Switching on his penlight, Connie holds it aloft until he discerns the label A. Dunfey glued to a dented mailbox. He begins the climb to apartment 8-C, his parishioner right behind. On the third landing, Connie stops to catch his breath. On the sixth, he sets down the font. Valerie wipes his brow with her parka sleeve. She takes up the font, and the two of them resume their ascent.</p>

<p>Angela Dunfey's door is wormy, cracked, and hanging by one hinge. The mere act of knocking swings it open.</p>

<p>They find themselves in the kitchen &mdash; a small musty space that would have felt claustrophobic were it not so sparely furnished. A saucepan hangs over the stove; a frying pan sits atop the icebox; the floor is a mottle of splinters, tar paper, and leprous shards of linoleum. Valerie places the font next to the sink. The basin in which Angela Dunfey washes her dishes, Connie notes, is actually smaller than the one in which the Church of the Immediate Conception immortalizes infertiles.</p>

<p>He tiptoes into the bedroom. His parishioner sleeps soundly, her terrycloth bathrobe parted down the middle to accommodate her groggy, nursing infant; milk trickles from her breasts, streaking her belly with white rivulets. He must move now, quickly and deliberately, so there'll be no struggle, no melodramatic replay of 1 Kings 3:27, the desperate whore trying to tear her baby away from Solomon's swordsman.</p>

<p>Inhaling slowly, Connie leans toward the mattress and, with the dexterity of a weasel extracting the innards from an eggshell, slides the barren baby free and carries her into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Beside the icebox Valerie sits glowering on a wobbly three-legged stool.</p>

<p><q>Dearly beloved, forasmuch as all humans enter the world in a state of depravity,</q> Connie whispers, casting a wary eye on Valerie, <q>and forasmuch as they cannot know the grace of our Lord except they be born anew of water</q> &mdash; he lays the infant on the floor near Valerie's feet &mdash;<q>I beseech you to call upon God the Father that, through this baptism, Merribell Dunfey may gain the divine kingdom.</q></p>

<p><q>Don't beseech me,</q> snaps Valerie.</p>

<p>Connie fills the saucepan, dumps the water into the font, and returns to the sink for another load &mdash; not exactly holy water, he muses, not remotely chrism, but presumably not typhoidal either, the best the underbudgeted Boston Water Authority has to offer. He deposits the load, then fetches another.</p>

<p>A wide, milky yawn twists Merribell's face, but she does not cry out.</p>

<p>At last the vessel is ready. <q>Bless these waters, 0 Lord, that they might grant this sinner the gift of life everlasting.</q></p>

<p>Dropping to his knees, Connie begins removing the infant's diaper. The first pin comes out easily. As he pops the second, the tip catches the ball of his thumb. Crown of thorns, he decides, feeling the sting, seeing the blood.</p>

<p>He bears the naked infant to the font. Wetting his punctured thumb, he touches Merribell's brow and draws the sacred plus sign with a mixture of blood and water. <q>We receive this sinner unto the mystical body of Christ, and do mark her with the Sign of the Cross.</q></p>

<p>He begins the immersion. Skullcap. Ears. Cheeks. Mouth. Eyes. 0 Lord, what a monstrous trust, this power to underwrite a person's soul. <q>Merribell Dunfey, I baptize you in the name of the Father &hellip;</q></p>

<p>Now comes the nausea, excavating Stephen's alimentary canal as he kneels before the porcelain toilet bowl. His guilt pours forth in a searing flood &mdash; acidic strands of cabbage, caustic lumps of potato, glutinous strings of bile. Yet these pains are nothing, he knows, compared with what he'll experience on passing from this world to the next.</p>

<p>Drained, he stumbles toward the bedroom. Somehow Kate has bundled the older children off to school before collapsing on the floor alongside the baby. She shivers with remorse. Shrieks and giggles pour from the nursery: the preschoolers engaged in a raucous game of Blind Man's Bluff.</p>

<p><q>Flaying machines,</q> she mutters. Her tone is beaten, bloodless. She lights a cigarette. <q>Peeling the damned like &hellip;</q></p>

<p>Will more rum help, Stephen wonders, or merely make them sicker? He extends his arm. Passing over the nightstand, his fingers touch a box of aspirin, brush the preserved Epigaea repens, and curl around the neck of the half-full Arbutus bottle. A ruddy cockroach scurries across the doily.</p>

<p><q>I kept Willy home today,</q> says Kate, taking a drag. <q>He says his stomach hurts.</q></p>

<p>As he raises the bottle, Stephen realizes for the first time that the label contains a block of type headed The Story of Trailing Arbutus. <q>His stomach always hurts.</q> He studies the breezy little paragraph.</p>

<p><q>I think he's telling the truth.</q></p>

<p>Epigaea repens. Trailing arbutus. Mayflower. And suddenly everything is clear.</p>

<p><q>What's today's date?</q> asks Stephen.</p>

<p><q>Sixteenth.</q></p>

<p><q>March sixteenth?</q></p>

<p><q>Yeah.</q></p>

<p><q>Then tomorrow's Saint Patrick's Day.</q></p>

<p><q>So what?</q></p>

<p><q>Tomorrow's Saint Patrick's Day</q> &mdash; like an auctioneer accepting a final bid, Stephen slams the bottle onto the nightstand &mdash; <q>and Valerie Gallogher will be leaving Boston Isle.</q></p>

<p><q>Roger's old teacher? Leaving?</q></p>

<p><q>Leaving.</q> Snatching up the preserved flower, he dangles it before his wife. <q>Leaving &hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>&hellip; and of the Son,</q> says Connie, raising the sputtering infant from the water, <q>and of the Holy Ghost.</q></p>

<p>Merribell Dunfey screeches and squirms. She's slippery as a bar of soap. Connie manages to wrap her in a dish towel and shove her into Valerie's arms.</p>

<p><q>Let me tell you who you are,</q> she says.</p>

<p><q>Father Cornelius Dennis Monaghan of Charlestown Parish.</q></p>

<p><q>You're a tired and bewildered pilgrim, Father. You're a weary wayfarer like myself.</q></p>

<p>Dribbling milk, Angela Dunfey staggers into the kitchen. Seeing her priest, she recoils. Her mouth flies open, and a howl rushes out, a cry such as Connie imagines the damned spew forth while rotating on the spits of Perdition. <q>Not her too! Not Merribell! No!</q></p>

<p><q>Your baby's all right,</q> says Valerie.</p>

<p>Connie clasps his hands together, fingers knotted in agony and supplication. He stoops. His knees hit the floor, crashing against the fractured linoleum. <q>Please,</q> he groans.</p>

<p>Angela plucks Merribell from Valerie and affixes the squalling baby to her nipple. <q>Oh, Merribell, Merribell &hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>Please.</q> Connie's voice is hoarse and jagged, as if he's been shot in the larynx. <q>Please &hellip; please,</q> he beseeches. Tears roll from his eyes, tickling his cheeks as they fall.</p>

<p><q>It's not her job to absolve you,</q> says Valerie.</p>

<p>Connie snuffles the mucus back into his nose. <q>I know.</q></p>

<p><q>The boat leaves tomorrow.</q></p>

<p><q>Boat?</q> Connie runs his sleeve across his face, blotting his tears.</p>

<p><q>A rescue vessel,</q> his parishioner explains. Sliding her hands beneath his armpits, she raises him inch by inch to his feet. <q>Rather like Noah's Ark.</q></p>

<p><q>Mommy, I want to go home.</q></p>

<p><q>Tell that to your stepfather.</q></p>

<p><q>It's cold.</q></p>

<p><q>I know, sweetheart.</q></p>

<p><q>And dark.</q></p>

<p><q>Try to be patient.</q></p>

<p><q>Mommy, my stomach hurts.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm sorry.</q></p>

<p><q>My head too.</q></p>

<p><q>You want an aspirin?</q></p>

<p><q>I want to go home.</q></p>

<p>Is this a mistake? wonders Stephen. Shouldn't they all be in bed right now instead of tromping around in this nocturnal mist, risking flu and possibly pneumonia? And yet he has faith. Somewhere in the labyrinthine reaches of the Hoosac Docks, amid the tang of salt air and the stink of rotting cod, a ship awaits.</p>

<p>Guiding his wife and stepchildren down Pier 7, he studies the possibilities &mdash; the scows and barges, the tugs and trawlers, the reefers and bulk carriers. Gulls and gannets hover above the wharfs, squawking their chronic disapproval of the world. Across the channel, lit by a sodium-vapor searchlight, the U.S. Constitution bobs in her customary berth beside Charlestown Navy Yard.</p>

<p><q>What're we doing here, anyway?</q> asks Beatrice.</p>

<p><q>Your stepfather gets these notions in his head.</q> Kate presses the baby tight against her chest, shielding him from the sea breeze.</p>

<p><q>What's the name of the boat?</q> asks Roger.</p>

<p><q>Mayflower,</q> answers Stephen.</p>

<p>Epigaea repens, trailing arbutus, mayflower.</p>

<p><q>How do you spell it?</q> Roger demands.</p>

<p><q>M-a-y &hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>&hellip; f-l-o-w-e-r?</q></p>

<p><q>Good job, Roger,</q> says Stephen.</p>

<p><q>I read it,</q> the boy explains indignantly, pointing straight ahead with the collective fingers of his right mitten.</p>

<p>Fifty yards away, moored between an oil tanker and a bait shack, a battered freighter rides the incoming tide. Her stern displays a single word, Mayflower, a name that to the inhabitants of Boston Isle means far more than the sum of its letters.</p>

<p><q>Now can we go home?</q> asks Roger.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> says Stephen. He has taught the story countless times. The Separatists' departure from England for Virginia &hellip; their hazardous voyage &hellip; their unplanned landing on Plymouth Rock &hellip; the signing of the covenant whereby the non-Separatists on board agreed to obey whatever rules the Separatists imposed. <q>Now we can go on a nice long voyage.</q></p>

<p><q>On that thing?</q> asks Willy.</p>

<p><q>You're not serious,</q> says Laura.</p>

<p><q>Not me,</q> says Claude.</p>

<p><q>Forget it,</q> says Yolanda.</p>

<p><q>Sayonara,</q> says Tommy.</p>

<p><q>I think I'm going to throw up,</q> says Beatrice.</p>

<p><q>It's not your decision,</q> Stephen tells his stepchildren. He stares at the ship's hull, blotched with rust, blistered with decay, another victim of the Deluge. A passenger whom he recognizes as his neighbor Michael Hines leans out a porthole like a prairie dog peering from its burrow. <q>Until further notice, I make all the rules.</q></p>

<p>Half by entreaty, half by coercion, he leads his disgruntled family up the gangplank and onto the quarterdeck, where a squat man in an orange raincoat and a maroon watch cap demands to see their ticket.</p>

<p><q>Happy Saint Patrick's Day,</q> says Stephen, flourishing the preserved blossom.</p>

<p><q>We're putting you people on the fo'c'sle deck,</q> the man yells above the growl of the idling engines. <q>You can hide behind the pianos. At ten o'clock you get a bran muffin and a cup of coffee.</q></p>

<p>As Stephen guides his stepchildren in a single file up the forward ladder, the crew of the Mayflower reels in the mooring lines and ravels up the anchor chains, setting her adrift. The engines kick in. Smoke pours from the freighter's twin stacks. Sunlight seeps across the bay, tinting the eastern sky hot pink and making the island's many-windowed towers glitter like Christmas trees.</p>

<p>A sleek Immortality Corps cutter glides by, headed for the wharfs, evidently unaware that enemies of the unconceived lie close at hand.</p>

<p>Slowly, cautiously, Stephen negotiates the maze of wooden crates it seems as if every piano on Boston Isle is being exported today &mdash; until he reaches the starboard bulwark. As he curls his palm around the rail, the Mayflower cruises past the Mystic Shoals, maneuvering amid the rocks like a skier following a slalom course.</p>

<p><q>Hello, Stephen.</q> A large woman lurches into view, abruptly kissing his cheek.</p>

<p>He gulps, blinking like a man emerging into sunlight from the darkness of a copulatorium. Valerie Gallogher's presence on the May. flower doesn't surprise him, but he's taken aback by her companions. Angela Dunfey, suckling little Merribell. Her cousin, Lorna, still spectacularly pregnant. And, most shocking of all, Father Monaghan, leaning his frail frame against his baptismal font.</p>

<p>Stephen says, <q>Did we &hellip;? Are you &hellip;?</q></p>

<p><q>My blood has spoken,</q> Valerie Gallogher replies, her red hair flying like a pennant. <q>In nine months I give birth to our child.</q></p>

<p>Whereupon the sky above Stephen's head begins swarming with tiny black birds. No, not birds, he realizes: devices. Ovulation gauges sail through the air, a dozen at first, then scores, then hundreds, immediately pursued by equal numbers of sperm counters. As the little machines splash down and sink, darkening the harbor like the contraband tea from an earlier moment in the history of Boston insurgency, a muffled but impassioned cheer arises among the stowaways.
</p>
<p><q>Hello, Father Monaghan.</q> Stephen unstraps his sperm counter. <q>Didn't expect to find you here.</q></p>

<p>The priest smiles feebly, drumming his fingers on the lip of the font. <q>Valerie informs me you're about to become a father again. Congratulations.</q></p>

<p><q>My instincts tell me it's a boy,</q> says Stephen, leaning over the rail. <q>He's going to get a second candy cane at Christmas,</q> asserts the bewildered pilgrim as, with a wan smile and a sudden flick of his wrist, he breaks his bondage to the future.</p>

<p>IF I DON'T ACT now, thinks Connie as he pivots toward Valerie Gallogher, I'll never find the courage again.</p>

<p><q>Do we have a destination?</q> he asks. Like a bear preparing to ascend a tree, he hugs the font, pulling it against his chest.</p>

<p><q>Only a purpose.</q> Valerie sweeps her hand across the horizon. <q>We won't find any Edens out there, Father. The entire Baltimore Reef has become a wriggling mass of flesh, newborns stretching shore to shore.</q> She removes her ovulation gauge and throws it over the side. <q>In the Minneapolis Keys, the Corps routinely casts homosexual men and menopausal women into the sea. On the California Archipelago, male parishioners receive periodic potency tests and &mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>The Atlanta Insularity?</q></p>

<p><q>A nightmare.</q></p>

<p><q>Miami Isle?</q></p>

<p><q>Forget it.</q></p>

<p>Connie lays the font atop the bulwark, then clambers onto the rail, straddling it like a child riding a see-saw. A loop of heavy-duty chain encircles the font, the steel links flashing in the rising sun. <q>Then what's our course?</q></p>

<p><q>East,</q> says Valerie. <q>Toward Europe. What are you doing?</q></p>

<p><q>East,</q> Connie echoes, tipping the font seaward. <q>Europe.</q></p>

<p>A muffled, liquid crash reverberates across the harbor. The font disappears, dragging the chain behind it.</p>

<p><q>Father!</q></p>

<p>Drawing in a deep breath, Connie studies the chain. The spiral of links unwinds quickly and smoothly, like a coiled rattlesnake striking its prey. The slack vanishes. Connie feels the iron shackle seize his ankle. He flips over. He falls.</p>

<p><q>Bless these waters, O Lord, that they might grant this sinner the gift of life everlasting &hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>Father!</q></p>

<p>He plunges into the harbor, penetrating its cold hard surface: an experience, he decides, not unlike throwing oneself through a plate glass window. The waters envelop him, filling his ears and stinging his eyes.</p>

<p>We welcome this sinner into the mystical body of Christ, and do mark him with the Sign of the Cross, Connie recites in his mind, reaching up and drawing the sacred plus sign on his forehead.</p>

<p>He exhales, bubble following bubble.</p>

<p>Cornelius Dennis Monaghan, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, he concludes, and as the black wind sweeps through his brain, sucking him toward immortality, he knows that he's never been happier.</p>
