<i><b>About the Author</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Robert B. Cialdini is Regents'&nbsp;Professor of Psychology at&nbsp;Arizona State University,&nbsp;<br>where he has also been named Graduate Distinguished Research Professor. He received&nbsp;<br>undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate training in psychology from&nbsp;the University&nbsp;<br>of Wisconsin, the University&nbsp;of North Carolina, and Columbia University, respectively.&nbsp;<br>He is past president of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology.&nbsp;<br>
He attributes his long-standing interest in the&nbsp;intricacies of social&nbsp;influence to the fact&nbsp;<br>that he was raised in an entirely Italian family, in a predominantly Polish neighborhood,&nbsp;<br>in a historically German city (Milwaukee), in an otherwise rural state.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name=7></a><i><b>Preface</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
The initial version of&nbsp;<i>Influence&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>was designed for the popular&nbsp;reader, and as such, an&nbsp;<br>attempt was made to write it in an&nbsp;engaging style. In the subsequent&nbsp;versions, that style&nbsp;<br>is retained,&nbsp;but in addition,&nbsp;I&nbsp;present&nbsp;the research evidence for my statements,&nbsp;<br>recommendations, and conclusions. Although&nbsp;they are dramatized and corroborated&nbsp;<br>through such devices as interviews, quotes,&nbsp;and systematic personal observations, the&nbsp;<br>conclusions of&nbsp;<i>Influence&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>are based on controlled, psychological research. This fact&nbsp;<br>allows the instructor, the student, and the popular reader to&nbsp;feel confident that the book&nbsp;<br>is not &quot;pop&quot; psychology but represents work that is scientifically grounded. The&nbsp;<br>subsequent versions also provide new and updated material, chapter summaries, and&nbsp;<br>study questions to enhance its classroom&nbsp;utility.&nbsp;<br>
A potentially attractive feature of the present version&nbsp;<i>of Influence&nbsp;</i>lies in its ability to&nbsp;<br>serve as an&nbsp;enjoyable, practical, yet scientifically documented text&nbsp;for both students&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br>the general reader. For students, one way to view the book, then, is to see it as a&nbsp;<br>refreshing change of pace (from&nbsp;standard text material) that does not retreat from&nbsp;<br>scientific respectability.&nbsp;In a related&nbsp;vein, for both students&nbsp;and the general reader, the&nbsp;<br>book might be seen as a way to demonstrate&nbsp;that, properly presented, what often seems&nbsp;<br>like dry science can actually prove to be lively, useful, and relevant to all readers'&nbsp;<br>personal lives.&nbsp;<br>
<b>COMMENT ON THE FOURTH EDITION</b>&nbsp;<br>
<b>OF&nbsp;<i>INFLUENCE: SCIENCE AND PRACTICE</i></b><b>_________________</b>&nbsp;<br>
It has been some time since&nbsp;<i>Influence&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>was last&nbsp;published. In&nbsp;the interim, some things&nbsp;<br>have happened that deserve a place in this&nbsp;new edition. First,&nbsp;we now know more about&nbsp;<br>the influence process than before. The study&nbsp;of persuasion, compliance, and change has&nbsp;<br>advanced, and the pages that follow have been adapted to reflect that progress.&nbsp;In&nbsp;<br>addition to an overall update of the material, I have expanded a feature that was&nbsp;<br>stimulated by the responses of prior readers.&nbsp;<br>
This feature highlights&nbsp;the experiences of individuals who have read&nbsp;<i>Influence,&nbsp;<br></i>recognized how one of the principles worked&nbsp;on (or for) them in a particular instance,&nbsp;<br>and wrote to me&nbsp;describing the event. Their&nbsp;descriptions, which appear in&nbsp;the &quot;Reader's&nbsp;<br>Reports&quot; in each chapter, illustrate how easily and frequently we can fall victim&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<br>influence process in&nbsp;our everyday lives.&nbsp;<br>
An array of people deserve and have my&nbsp;appreciation for their aid in making&nbsp;<i>Influence&nbsp;<br></i>possible. Several of my&nbsp;academic colleagues read and provided perceptive comments on&nbsp;<br>the entire manuscript in its initial draft&nbsp;form, greatly strengthening the subsequent&nbsp;<br>version. They are Gus Levine, Doug Kenrick, Art Beaman, and Mark Zanna. In&nbsp;<br>addition, the first draft was read by&nbsp;a few family members and friends.&nbsp;<br>

A second, larger group provided helpful suggestions for selected chapters or groups of&nbsp;<br>chapters: Todd Anderson, Sandy Braver, Catherine Chambers, Judi&nbsp;Cialdini, Nancy&nbsp;<br>Eisenberg, Larry Ettkin, Joanne Gersten, Jeff Goldstein, Betsy Hans, Valerie Hans, Joe&nbsp;<br>Hepworth, Holly Hunt, Ann Inskeep, Barry&nbsp;Leshowitz, Darwyn Under, Debbie Littler,&nbsp;<br>John Mowen, Igor Pavlov, Janis Posner, Trish Puryear, Marilyn Rail, John Reich, Peter&nbsp;<br>Reingen, Diane Ruble, Phyllis Sensenig, Roman Sherman, and Henry Wellman.&nbsp;<br>
Certain people were instrumental at the&nbsp;beginning stages. John Staley was the first&nbsp;<br>publishing professional to recognize the project's potential.&nbsp;Jim&nbsp;Sherman, Al Goethals,&nbsp;<br>John Keating, Dan Wagner, Dalmas Taylor, Wendy Wood, and David Watson provided&nbsp;<br>early, positive reviews that encouraged author&nbsp;and editors alike. My&nbsp;editors at Allyn and&nbsp;<br>Bacon, Carolyn Merrill and Jodi&nbsp;Devine, were consistently&nbsp;congenial, helpful, and&nbsp;<br>insightful. I&nbsp;would like&nbsp;to thank the following&nbsp;users of&nbsp;the third edition for their&nbsp;<br>feedback during a telephone survey: Emory Griffin, Wheaton College; Robert Levine,&nbsp;<br>California State, Fresno; Jeffrey Lewin,&nbsp;Georgia State University; David Miller,&nbsp;<br>Daytona Beach Community College; Lois Mohr,&nbsp;Georgia State University; and Richard&nbsp;<br>Rogers, Daytona Beach&nbsp;Community College.&nbsp;The third edition benefited substantially&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;the reviews of Assaad Azzi,&nbsp;Yale University; Robert M. Brady,&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>Arkansas; Brian M. Cohen, University of Texas at San Antonio; Christian B. Crandall,&nbsp;<br>University of Florida; Catherine Goodwin, University of&nbsp;Alaska; Robert G. Lowder,&nbsp;<br>Bradley University; James W.&nbsp;Michael, Jr., Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State&nbsp;<br>University; Eugene P. Sheehan, University&nbsp;of Northern Colorado; Jefferson A. Singer,&nbsp;<br>Connecticut College; and Sandi W.&nbsp;Smith, Michigan State University.&nbsp;<br>
Finally, throughout the project, no one was more on my&nbsp;side than Bobette Gor-den, who&nbsp;<br>lived every word with me.&nbsp;<br>
I wish to thank the following individuals who—either directly or&nbsp;through their course&nbsp;<br>instructors—contributed the &quot;Reader's Reports&quot; used in this edition:&nbsp;Pat Bobbs, Annie&nbsp;<br>Carlo, William&nbsp;Cooper, Alicia Friedman, William&nbsp;Graziano,&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;Hastings, Endayehu&nbsp;<br>Kendie, Danuta Lubnicka, James Michaels, Steven Moysey, Paul Nail, Alan J.

<a name=9></a><i><b>Introduction</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>I&nbsp;</i>can&nbsp;admit it freely now. All my&nbsp;life I've been&nbsp;a patsy. For as long&nbsp;as&nbsp;I can recall, I've&nbsp;<br>been an easy mark for the pitches of&nbsp;peddlers,&nbsp;fund-raisers, and operators of one sort or&nbsp;<br>another. True, only some of these people&nbsp;have had dishonorable motives. The others—<br>representatives of certain charitable agencies, for instance—have had the best of&nbsp;<br>intentions.&nbsp;No matter. With personally&nbsp;disquieting frequency, I have always found&nbsp;<br>myself in possession of unwanted magazine&nbsp;subscriptions or tickets to the sanitation&nbsp;<br>workers'&nbsp;ball. Probably this long-standing status as sucker accounts for my interest in&nbsp;<br>the study of compliance: Just what are the factors that cause one person to say yes to&nbsp;<br>another person?&nbsp;And which techniques most effectively use these factors to bring about&nbsp;<br>such compliance?&nbsp;I have wondered why it is that a request stated in&nbsp;a certain way will&nbsp;<br>be rejected, but a request that&nbsp;asks for the&nbsp;same favor in a slightly&nbsp;different fashion&nbsp;will&nbsp;<br>be successful.&nbsp;<br>
So in my&nbsp;role as an&nbsp;experimental social psychologist, I began to research the&nbsp;<br>psychology of compliance. At first the research took&nbsp;the form of experiments&nbsp;<br>performed, for the most part, in my laboratory and on college students.&nbsp;I wanted to find&nbsp;<br>out which psychological principles influenced&nbsp;the tendency to comply with a request.&nbsp;<br>Right now, psychologists know quite a bit about these principles—what they are and&nbsp;<br>how they work. I have characterized such principles as weapons of influence and will be&nbsp;<br>discussing some&nbsp;of the most important of them&nbsp;in this book.&nbsp;<br>
After a time, though, I began to realize that&nbsp;the experimental work, while necessary,&nbsp;<br>wasn't&nbsp;enough. It didn't allow me&nbsp;to judge the importance of the principles in the world&nbsp;<br>beyond the psychology building and the campus where I was examining them. It&nbsp;<br>became clear that if I was to understand fully the psychology of compliance, I would&nbsp;<br>need to broaden my scope of investigation. I would need to look to the compliance&nbsp;<br>professionals—the people who had been using the principles on me&nbsp;all my life. They&nbsp;<br>know what works and what doesn't; the law of&nbsp;survival of&nbsp;the fittest assures it. Their&nbsp;<br>business is to make us comply, and their livelihoods depend on it. Those who don't&nbsp;<br>know how to get people to say yes soon fall away; those who do, stay and flourish.&nbsp;<br>
Of course, the compliance professionals aren't&nbsp;the only ones who know about and use&nbsp;<br>these principles to&nbsp;help them&nbsp;get their way.&nbsp;We all employ them&nbsp;and fall victim&nbsp;to them&nbsp;<br>to some&nbsp;degree in our daily interactions with neighbors, friends, lovers, and family.&nbsp;But&nbsp;<br>the compliance practitioners&nbsp;have much&nbsp;more than the vague and amateurish&nbsp;<br>understanding of what works than the rest of&nbsp;us have. As I thought about it, I knew that&nbsp;<br>they represented the richest vein of information about compliance available to me. For&nbsp;<br>nearly three years, then, I combined my&nbsp;experimental studies with a decidedly more&nbsp;<br>entertaining&nbsp;program: I systematically immersed myself&nbsp;in the world of&nbsp;compliance&nbsp;<br>professionals—salespeople, fund-raisers, advertisers, and others.&nbsp;<br>
My purpose was to observe, from the inside, the techniques and strategies most&nbsp;<br>commonly and effectively used by a broad&nbsp;range of compliance practitioners. That&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=10></a>program&nbsp;of observation sometimes took the form&nbsp;of interviews with&nbsp;the practitioners&nbsp;<br>themselves and sometimes with the natural enemies (for&nbsp;example, police bunco-squad&nbsp;<br>officers, consumer agencies) of certain of&nbsp;the practitioners. At other times, it involved&nbsp;<br>an intensive&nbsp;examination of&nbsp;the written materials by which&nbsp;compliance&nbsp;techniques are&nbsp;<br>passed down from&nbsp;one generation to another—sales manuals and the like.&nbsp;<br>
Most frequently, though, it took the form&nbsp;of participant observation. Participant&nbsp;<br>observation is a research approach in which the researcher becomes a&nbsp;spy of sorts. With&nbsp;<br>disguised identity and intent, the investigator infiltrates the setting of&nbsp;interest and&nbsp;<br>becomes a full-fledged participant in the group&nbsp;to be studied. So when I wanted to learn&nbsp;<br>about the compliance tactics of encyclopedia (or vacuum cleaner, or portrait&nbsp;<br>photography, or dance lesson)&nbsp;sales organizations, I would&nbsp;answer a newspaper ad for&nbsp;<br>sales trainees and have them&nbsp;teach me&nbsp;their methods. Using similar but not identical&nbsp;<br>approaches, I was able to penetrate advertising, public relations, and fund-raising&nbsp;<br>agencies to examine their techniques. Much&nbsp;of the evidence presented in this book, then,&nbsp;<br>comes from&nbsp;my experience posing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;compliance professional, or aspiring&nbsp;<br>professional, in a large variety of organizations dedicated to getting us to say yes.&nbsp;<br>
One aspect of what I learned&nbsp;in this three-year&nbsp;period of&nbsp;participant observation was&nbsp;<br>most instructive. Although there are thousands of different tactics that compliance&nbsp;<br>practitioners employ to produce yes, the majority fall within&nbsp;six basic categories. Each&nbsp;<br>of these categories is governed by a fundamental psychological principle that directs&nbsp;<br>human behavior and, in so doing, gives the tactics their power. This book is organized&nbsp;<br>around these six principles. The principles—reciprocation, consistency, social proof,&nbsp;<br>liking,&nbsp;authority,&nbsp;and scarcity—are each&nbsp;discussed in&nbsp;terms of their function in&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>society and in terms of how their enormous force can be commissioned by a compliance&nbsp;<br>professional who deftly incorporates them&nbsp;into requests for purchases, donations,&nbsp;<br>concessions, votes, or assent.1&nbsp;<br>
Finally, each&nbsp;principle is examined as to its ability to produce a distinct&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;<br>automatic, mindless compliance from&nbsp;people, that is, a willingness&nbsp;to say yes without&nbsp;<br>thinking first. The evidence suggests that&nbsp;the ever-accelerating pace and informational&nbsp;<br>crush of modern life will make this particular form&nbsp;of unthinking compliance more and&nbsp;<br>more prevalent in the future.&nbsp;It will be increasingly important for the society,&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;<br>to understand the how and why of automatic influence.&nbsp;<br>
'it is worth noting that I have not included among the six principles the&nbsp;simple rule&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>material self-interest: that people want to&nbsp;get the most and pay the least for their&nbsp;<br>choices. This omission does not stem from&nbsp;any&nbsp;perception on my part that the desire to&nbsp;<br>maximize benefits and minimize costs is unimportant in driving our decisions. Nor does&nbsp;<br>it come from&nbsp;any evidence that I have that&nbsp;compliance professionals&nbsp;ignore the power of&nbsp;<br>this rule. Quite the opposite: in my&nbsp;investigations, I frequently saw practitioners use&nbsp;<br>(sometimes honestly, sometimes not) the compelling &quot;I can give you a good deal&quot;&nbsp;<br>approach. I chose not to treat&nbsp;the&nbsp;material self-interest rule separately in this&nbsp;hook&nbsp;<br>because I see it as&nbsp;a motivational given, as&nbsp;a goes-without-saying factor&nbsp;that&nbsp;deserves&nbsp;<br>acknowledgment, but not extensive description.&nbsp;<br>

<i>Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without&nbsp;<br>thinking about them.</i>&nbsp;<br>
—ALFRED NORTH WHITEHEAD&nbsp;<br>
I got a phone call one day from&nbsp;a friend who had recently&nbsp;opened an Indian jewelry&nbsp;<br>store in Arizona. She was giddy with a curious piece of news. Something fascinating&nbsp;<br>had just happened, and she thought that, as a&nbsp;psychologist, I might be able to explain it&nbsp;<br>to her. The story involved a&nbsp;certain allotment of turquoise&nbsp;jewelry she had been having&nbsp;<br>trouble selling. It was the peak of the tourist season, the store was unusually full of&nbsp;<br>customers, the turquoise pieces were of good&nbsp;quality for the prices she was asking; yet&nbsp;<br>they had not sold. My friend had attempted a couple of standard sales tricks to get them&nbsp;<br>moving. She tried calling attention to them&nbsp;by&nbsp;shifting their location to a more central&nbsp;<br>display area; no luck. She even told her sales staff&nbsp;to &quot;push&quot; the items hard—again&nbsp;<br>without success.&nbsp;<br>
Finally, the night before leaving on an&nbsp;out-of-town buying trip, she scribbled an&nbsp;<br>exasperated note to her head saleswoman, &quot;Everything in this&nbsp;display case, price x Vi,&quot;&nbsp;<br>hoping just to be rid of the offending pieces, even if at a loss. When she returned a few&nbsp;<br>days later, she was not surprised to find&nbsp;that every article had been&nbsp;sold. She was&nbsp;<br>shocked, though, to discover that,&nbsp;because the employee had read the&nbsp;<i>&quot;W&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>in her&nbsp;<br>scrawled message as a &quot;2,&quot; the entire allotment had sold at twice the original price!&nbsp;<br>
That's&nbsp;when she called me. I thought I knew what had happened but&nbsp;told her that, if I&nbsp;<br>were to explain things properly, she would have to listen to&nbsp;a story of mine. Actually, it&nbsp;<br>isn't my&nbsp;story; it's about mother turkeys, and it belongs to the relatively new science of&nbsp;<br>ethology—the study of animals in their natural settings. Turkey mothers are good&nbsp;<br>mothers—loving, watchful, and protective.&nbsp;They spend much of their time tending,&nbsp;<br>warming, cleaning, and huddling their young beneath them; but there is something odd&nbsp;<br>about their method. Virtually all of this mothering is triggered by one&nbsp;thing: the &quot;cheep-<br>cheep&quot; sound of young turkey chicks. Other identifying features of the chicks, such as&nbsp;<br>their smell, touch, or appearance, seem to play&nbsp;minor roles in the mothering process. If a&nbsp;<br>chick makes the cheep-cheep noise,&nbsp;its mother&nbsp;will care for&nbsp;it; if&nbsp;not, the mother will&nbsp;<br>ignore or sometimes kill it.&nbsp;<br>
The extreme reliance of maternal turkeys upon this one sound was dramatically&nbsp;<br>illustrated by&nbsp;animal behaviorist M.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Fox (1974) in his description of&nbsp;an experiment&nbsp;<br>involving&nbsp;a mother turkey and a stuffed polecat. For a mother turkey, a polecat is a&nbsp;<br>natural enemy whose approach is to be greeted with squawking, pecking, clawing rage.&nbsp;<br>Indeed, the experiments found that even a stuffed model of a polecat, when drawn by a&nbsp;<br>string to a mother turkey,&nbsp;received an immediate and furious attack. When, however, the&nbsp;<br>same stuffed replica carried inside it a small&nbsp;recorder that played the cheep-cheep sound&nbsp;<br>of baby turkeys, the mother not only accepted the oncoming&nbsp;<br>

<b>CLICK, WHIRR</b>&nbsp;<br>
How ridiculous a mother turkey seems under these circumstances: She will embrace a&nbsp;<br>natural enemy just because it goes&nbsp;cheep-cheep&nbsp;and she will mistreat or murder one of&nbsp;<br>her chicks just because it does not.&nbsp;She acts&nbsp;like an automaton whose maternal instincts&nbsp;<br>are under the automatic&nbsp;control of that single sound. The&nbsp;ethol-ogists tell us that this&nbsp;<br>sort of thing is far from&nbsp;unique to the turkey. They have begun to identify regular,&nbsp;<br>blindly mechanical patterns of action in a wide variety of species.&nbsp;<br>
<i>Called fixed-action patterns,&nbsp;</i>they can involve intricate sequences of behavior, such as&nbsp;<br>entire courtship or mating rituals. A fundamental characteristic of these patterns is that&nbsp;<br>the behaviors comprising them&nbsp;occur in virtually&nbsp;the&nbsp;same fashion and&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;same order&nbsp;<br>every time. It is almost as if the patterns&nbsp;were recorded on tapes within&nbsp;the animals.&nbsp;<br>When a situation calls for courtship, a courtship tape gets played; when a&nbsp;situation calls&nbsp;<br>for mothering, a maternal behavior tape gets played.&nbsp;<i>Click&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>and the appropriate tape is&nbsp;<br>activated;&nbsp;<i>whirr&nbsp;</i>and out rolls the standard&nbsp;sequence of behaviors.&nbsp;<br>
The most interesting aspect of&nbsp;all this is the&nbsp;way the tapes are activated. When an&nbsp;<br>animal acts to defend its&nbsp;territory for instance,&nbsp;it is the intrusion of&nbsp;another animal of the&nbsp;<br>same species that cues the territorial-defense&nbsp;tape of rigid vigilance, threat, and if need&nbsp;<br>be, combat behaviors; however, there is a quirk&nbsp;in the system. It is not the rival as a&nbsp;<br>whole that is&nbsp;the trigger; it is,&nbsp;rather, some&nbsp;specific feature, the&nbsp;<i>trigger feature.&nbsp;</i>Often the&nbsp;<br>trigger feature will be just one tiny aspect of&nbsp;the totality that is the approaching intruder.&nbsp;<br>Sometimes a shade of color is the trigger feature. The experiments of ethologists have&nbsp;<br>shown, for instance, that a male robin, acting as&nbsp;if&nbsp;a rival robin had entered its territory,&nbsp;<br>will vigorously attack&nbsp;nothing more than a&nbsp;clump of&nbsp;robin red breast feathers placed&nbsp;<br>there. At the same&nbsp;time, it will virtually ignore a perfect stuffed replica of a male robin&nbsp;<br><i>without&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>red breast feathers (Lack, 1943). Similar&nbsp;results have been found in another&nbsp;<br>species of bird, the bluethroat, where it appears&nbsp;that the trigger for territorial&nbsp;defense is a&nbsp;<br>specific shade of blue breast feathers (Peipo-nen, 1960).&nbsp;<br>
Before we enjoy too smugly the ease with which trigger features can trick lower animals&nbsp;<br>into reacting in ways wholly inappropriate to&nbsp;the situation, we should realize two things.&nbsp;<br>First, the automatic, fixed-action patterns of&nbsp;these animals work very well most of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>time. For example, because only normal, healthy turkey chicks make the peculiar sound&nbsp;<br>of&nbsp;baby turkeys, it makes sense for mother turkeys to respond maternally to that single&nbsp;<br>cheep-cheep&nbsp;noise.&nbsp;By reacting to&nbsp;just that one&nbsp;stimulus, the average mother turkey&nbsp;will&nbsp;<br>nearly always behave correctly. It takes a trickster like a&nbsp;<br>

scientist to make her tapelike response seem&nbsp;silly. The&nbsp;second important thing to&nbsp;<br>understand is that we, too, have our preprogrammed tapes;&nbsp;and, although they usually&nbsp;<br>work to our advantage, the trigger features that&nbsp;activate them&nbsp;can dupe us into playing&nbsp;<br>the tapes at the wrong times.1&nbsp;<br>
This parallel&nbsp;form&nbsp;of&nbsp;human automaticity is aptly demonstrated in an experiment by&nbsp;<br>social psychologist Ellen Langer and her&nbsp;co-workers (Langer, Blank, &amp; Chanowitz,&nbsp;<br>1978). A well-known principle of human behavior&nbsp;says that when we ask someone to do&nbsp;<br>us a favor we will be more successful if we&nbsp;provide a reason. People simply like to have&nbsp;<br>reasons for what they do. Langer demonstrated&nbsp;this unsurprising fact by asking a small&nbsp;<br>favor of people waiting in line to use a&nbsp;library copying machine: &quot;Excuse me, I have&nbsp;<br>five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I'm&nbsp;in a rush?&quot; The effectiveness of&nbsp;<br>this request plus-reason was nearly total: 94 percent of those&nbsp;asked let her skip ahead of&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;in line.&nbsp;Compare this success rate&nbsp;to&nbsp;the results&nbsp;when she made the request only:&nbsp;<br>&quot;Excuse me, I have five pages. May&nbsp;I use the Xerox machine?&quot; Under those&nbsp;<br>circumstances only 60 percent of those asked&nbsp;complied. At first glance, it appears that&nbsp;<br>the crucial difference between the two requests was the&nbsp;additional information&nbsp;provided&nbsp;<br>by the words&nbsp;<i>because I'm in a rush.&nbsp;</i>However, a third type of request tried by Langer&nbsp;<br>showed that this was not the case. It seems that it was not the whole series&nbsp;of words, but&nbsp;<br>the first one,&nbsp;<i>because,&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>that made the difference. Instead of including a real reason for&nbsp;<br>compliance, Langer's third type&nbsp;of request used the word&nbsp;<i>because&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>and then, adding&nbsp;<br>nothing new, merely restated the obvious: &quot;Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the&nbsp;<br>Xerox machine because I have to make some&nbsp;copies?&quot;&nbsp;The result&nbsp;was that once again&nbsp;<br>nearly all (93 percent) agreed, even though no real&nbsp;reason, no new information was&nbsp;<br>added to justify their compliance. Just as the cheep-cheep sound of turkey chicks&nbsp;<br>triggered an automatic mothering response from&nbsp;mother turkeys, even when it emanated&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;a stuffed polecat, so&nbsp;the word&nbsp;<i>because&nbsp;</i>triggered an automatic compliance response&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;Langer's subjects,&nbsp;even when&nbsp;they were given no subsequent&nbsp;reason to comply.&nbsp;<br><i>Click, whirr.2</i>&nbsp;<br>
Although some of Langer's additional findings&nbsp;show that there are many situations&nbsp;in&nbsp;<br>which human behavior does not work in a&nbsp;mechanical, tape-activated way, she is&nbsp;<br>convinced that most of the time it does (Langer, 1989). For instance, consider the&nbsp;<br>strange behavior of those jewelry store&nbsp;customers who swooped down on an allotment&nbsp;<br>of turquoise pieces only after the items had been mistakenly offered at double their&nbsp;<br>original price. I can&nbsp;make&nbsp;no sense of their behavior&nbsp;unless&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;viewed&nbsp;in&nbsp;<i>click, whirr&nbsp;<br></i>terms.&nbsp;<br>
'Although several important similarities exist between this kind&nbsp;of automaticity in&nbsp;<br>humans and lower animals, there are some&nbsp;important differences as well.&nbsp;The automatic&nbsp;<br>behavior patterns of humans tend to be learned rather than inborn, more flexible than&nbsp;<br>the lock-step patterns of the lower animals, and responsive to a larger number&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>triggers.&nbsp;<br>
2Perhaps the common &quot;because ... just because&quot; response of children asked to explain&nbsp;<br>their behavior can be traced&nbsp;to their shrewd recognition&nbsp;of the unusual amount of power&nbsp;<br>adults appear to assign to the word&nbsp;<i>because.</i>&nbsp;<br>

The customers, mostly well-to-do vacationers&nbsp;with little knowledge of turquoise,&nbsp;were&nbsp;<br>using a standard principle—a stereotype—to&nbsp;guide their buying: expensive = good.&nbsp;<br>Much research shows that people who are unsure of&nbsp;an item's quality often use this&nbsp;<br>stereotype (for a review, see Olson, 1977). Thus the vacationers, who wanted &quot;good&quot;&nbsp;<br>jewelry,&nbsp;saw the turquoise pieces&nbsp;as decidedly more valuable and desirable when&nbsp;<br>nothing about them&nbsp;was enhanced but the price. Price alone had become a trigger&nbsp;<br>feature for quality, and a dramatic increase in&nbsp;price alone had&nbsp;led to a dramatic increase&nbsp;<br>in sales among the quality-hungry buyers.3&nbsp;<br>
<b>READER'S&nbsp;REPORT 1.1</b>&nbsp;<br>
<b>From a Management Doctoral Student</b>&nbsp;<br>
A man who owns an antique jewelry store in&nbsp;my town tells a story of how he learned&nbsp;<br>the expensive = good lesson of social influence. A friend of his wanted a special&nbsp;<br>birthday present for his fiancee. So, the jeweler picked out a necklace that would have&nbsp;<br>sold in his store for $500 but that he was&nbsp;willing to let his friend have for $250. As soon&nbsp;<br>as he saw it, the friend was enthusiastic about the piece. But when the jeweler quoted&nbsp;<br>the $250 price, the man's face fell,&nbsp;and he began&nbsp;backing&nbsp;away from&nbsp;the deal because he&nbsp;<br>wanted something &quot;really nice&quot; for his intended bride.&nbsp;<br>
When a day later it dawned on the jeweler what had happened, he called his friend and&nbsp;<br>asked him&nbsp;to come&nbsp;back to the store because&nbsp;he&nbsp;had another necklace to show him.&nbsp;This&nbsp;<br>time, he introduced the new piece at its regular $500 price.&nbsp;His friend liked it enough&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>buy it on the spot. But before any money was exchanged, the jeweler told him that, as a&nbsp;<br>wedding gift, he would drop the price to $250.&nbsp;The man was thrilled. Now, rather than&nbsp;<br>finding the $250 sales price offensive, he&nbsp;was overjoyed— and grateful—to have it.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Author's note:&nbsp;</b>Notice&nbsp;that, as in&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;the turquoise jewelry&nbsp;buyers, it was&nbsp;<br>someone who wanted to be assured of good&nbsp;merchandise who disdained the low-priced&nbsp;<br>item. I'm confident that besides the &quot;expensive = good&quot; rule, there's a flip side,&nbsp;<br>&quot;inexpensive&nbsp;</i>=&nbsp;<i>bad&quot; rule that applies to our thinking&nbsp;as well. After all, in English, the&nbsp;<br>word&nbsp;</i>cheap&nbsp;<i>doesn't just mean inexpensive; it&nbsp;has come to mean inferior, too.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<b>BETTING THE SHORTCUT ODDS</b>&nbsp;<br>
It is easy to fault the tourists for their foolish purchase decisions, but a close look offers&nbsp;<br>a kinder view. These were people who&nbsp;had been brought up on the rule, &quot;You&nbsp;<br>
3In marketing lore, the classic case of this&nbsp;phenomenon is that of Chivas Regal Scotch&nbsp;<br>Whiskey, which had been a struggling brand until its managers&nbsp;decided&nbsp;to raise its&nbsp;price&nbsp;<br>to a level far above its competitors. Sales skyrocketed, even though nothing was&nbsp;<br>changed in the product itself (Aaker, 1991).&nbsp;<br>

get what you pay for&quot; and who&nbsp;had seen that rule borne out&nbsp;over and over in their lives.&nbsp;<br>Before long, they had translated the rule to mean expensive = good. The expensive =&nbsp;<br>good stereotype had worked quite well for them&nbsp;in the past, since normally the price of&nbsp;<br>an item&nbsp;increases along with its worth; a higher price typically reflects higher quality.&nbsp;<br>So when they found themselves in the position of wanting good turquoise jewelry but&nbsp;<br>not having much knowledge of turquoise, they&nbsp;understandably relied on the old standby&nbsp;<br>feature of cost to determine the jewelry's merits (Rao &amp; Monroe, 1989).&nbsp;<br>
Although they probably did not realize it, by&nbsp;reacting solely to the price of the&nbsp;<br>turquoise, they were playing a shortcut version of betting the odds. Instead of stacking&nbsp;<br>all the odds in their favor by trying&nbsp;painstakingly to master each feature that indicates&nbsp;<br>the worth of turquoise jewelry, they were&nbsp;counting on just one—the one they knew to&nbsp;<br>be usually associated with the quality of any item. They were betting that price alone&nbsp;<br>would tell them&nbsp;all they&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;know. This time, because someone mistook a &quot;Vz&quot;&nbsp;<br>for a &quot;2,&quot; they bet wrong. In the long run, over&nbsp;all the past and future&nbsp;situations of their&nbsp;<br>lives, betting those shortcut odds may represent the most rational approach possible.&nbsp;<br>
In fact, automatic, stereotyped behavior is&nbsp;prevalent in much human action, because in&nbsp;<br>many cases, it is the most efficient form&nbsp;of behaving (Gigerenzer&nbsp;&amp; Goldstein, 1996),&nbsp;<br>and in other cases it is simply necessary (Bodenhausen, Macrae, &amp; Sherman, 1999;&nbsp;<br>Fiske &amp; Neuberg, 1990). You and I exist in an extraordinarily complicated&nbsp;<br>environment, easily the most rapidly moving&nbsp;and complex that has ever existed on this&nbsp;<br>planet.&nbsp;To deal with it, we&nbsp;<i>need&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>shortcuts. We can't&nbsp;be&nbsp;expected to recognize and&nbsp;<br>analyze all the aspects in each person, event,&nbsp;and situation&nbsp;we encounter in&nbsp;even&nbsp;one&nbsp;<br>day. We&nbsp;haven't the time, energy, or capacity for it. Instead, we must very often use our&nbsp;<br>stereotypes, our rules of&nbsp;thumb, to classify&nbsp;things according to a few key features and&nbsp;<br>then to respond without thinking when one or another of&nbsp;these trigger features is&nbsp;<br>present.&nbsp;<br>
Sometimes the behavior that unrolls&nbsp;will not&nbsp;be appropriate for the situation,&nbsp;because&nbsp;<br>not even&nbsp;the&nbsp;best stereotypes&nbsp;and trigger features work every time. We will accept&nbsp;their&nbsp;<br>imperfections since there is&nbsp;really no other choice. Without these features we would&nbsp;<br>stand frozen—cataloging, appraising, and&nbsp;calibrating—as the time for action sped by&nbsp;<br>and away. From&nbsp;all indications, we will be relying on these stereotypes to an even&nbsp;<br>greater extent in the future. As the stimuli&nbsp;saturating our lives continue to grow more&nbsp;<br>intricate and&nbsp;variable, we will have to depend increasingly on our shortcuts to handle&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;all.4&nbsp;<br>
4Take, by way of illustration, the case (Zimmatore, 1983) of the automatic, mindless&nbsp;<br>consumer response to a standard trigger&nbsp;for buying in our society—the discount coupon.&nbsp;<br>A tire company found that mailed-out coupons which, because of a printing error,&nbsp;<br>offered no savings to recipients produced just as much customer response as did the&nbsp;<br>error-free coupons that offered substantial savings.&nbsp;<br>

Psychologists have recently uncovered a number&nbsp;of mental shortcuts that we employ in&nbsp;<br>making our everyday judgments (Chaiken&nbsp;&amp; Trope, 1999; Kahneman, Slovic, &amp;&nbsp;<br>Tversky, 1982).&nbsp;<i>Termed judgmental heuristics,&nbsp;</i>these shortcuts operate in much the&nbsp;<br>same&nbsp;fashion as the expensive = good rule,&nbsp;allowing for simplified thinking that works&nbsp;<br>well most of the time but leaves us open to&nbsp;occasional, costly mistakes. Especially&nbsp;<br>relevant to this book are those&nbsp;heuristics that tell us when&nbsp;to believe or do what we are&nbsp;<br>told. Consider, for example, the&nbsp;shortcut rule that goes, &quot;If an expert said so, it must be&nbsp;<br>true.&quot;&nbsp;As we will see&nbsp;in Chapter&nbsp;6, there is an unsettling tendency in our society to&nbsp;<br>accept unthinkingly the statements and directions of individuals who&nbsp;appear to be&nbsp;<br>authorities on the topic. That&nbsp;is, rather than thinking about&nbsp;an expert's&nbsp;arguments and&nbsp;<br>being convinced (or not), we frequently ignore the arguments and allow ourselves to be&nbsp;<br>convinced just by the expert's status as &quot;expert.&quot; This tendency to&nbsp;respond mechanically&nbsp;<br>to one piece&nbsp;of&nbsp;information in a situation&nbsp;is what&nbsp;we have been calling&nbsp;automatic or&nbsp;<br><i>click, whirr&nbsp;</i>responding; the tendency to&nbsp;react on the basis of a&nbsp;thorough analysis of all&nbsp;<br>of the information can be referred to as&nbsp;<i>controlled responding&nbsp;</i>(Chaiken &amp; Trope, 1999).&nbsp;<br>

Quite a lot of laboratory research has shown&nbsp;that people are more likely to deal with&nbsp;<br>information in a controlled fashion when they have both the desire and the ability to&nbsp;<br>analyze it carefully; otherwise, they&nbsp;are likely to use the easier&nbsp;<i>click, whirr&nbsp;</i>approach&nbsp;<br>(for reviews, see Chen &amp; Chaiken, 1999; Petty &amp; Wegener, 1999). For instance, in one&nbsp;<br>study (Petty, Cacioppo, &amp; Goldman, 1981), students at the University of Missouri&nbsp;<br>listened to a recorded speech that supported&nbsp;the idea of requiring all seniors to&nbsp;pass&nbsp;<br>comprehensive examinations before they would be allowed to graduate. The issue&nbsp;<br>affected some of them&nbsp;personally, because they&nbsp;were told that the exams could go into&nbsp;<br>effect in the next year—before they had the chance to graduate. Of course, this news&nbsp;<br>made them&nbsp;want to analyze the arguments carefully. However, for other subjects in the&nbsp;<br>study, the issue had little personal importance—because they were told that the exams&nbsp;<br>would not begin until long after they had graduated; consequently, they&nbsp;had no strong&nbsp;<br>need to carefully consider the argument's validity. The study's results were quite&nbsp;<br>straightforward: Those subjects with no personal stake in&nbsp;the topic were primarily&nbsp;<br>persuaded&nbsp;by&nbsp;the speaker's expertise in the field&nbsp;of&nbsp;education;&nbsp;they used&nbsp;the &quot;If an&nbsp;expert&nbsp;<br>said so, it must be true&quot; rule, paying little&nbsp;attention to the strength of the speaker's&nbsp;<br>arguments. Those subjects for whom the issue mattered personally, on the other hand,&nbsp;<br>ignored the speaker's&nbsp;expertise and were&nbsp;persuaded primarily by the quality of the&nbsp;<br>speaker's arguments.&nbsp;<br>
So, it appears that when&nbsp;it comes to the dangerous business of&nbsp;<i>click, whirr&nbsp;</i>responding,&nbsp;<br>we give ourselves a safety net: We resist&nbsp;the seductive luxury of&nbsp;registering and reacting&nbsp;<br>to just a single (trigger)&nbsp;feature of the available information when an issue is important&nbsp;<br>to us. No doubt this is often the case&nbsp;(Leippe &amp; Elkin, 1987). Yet, I am&nbsp;not fully&nbsp;<br>comforted. Recall that earlier we learned&nbsp;that people are likely to respond in a&nbsp;<br>controlled, thoughtful fashion only when they have both the desire&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>the ability to&nbsp;do&nbsp;<br>so. I have recently become&nbsp;impressed by evidence suggesting that the form and pace of&nbsp;<br>modern life is not allowing&nbsp;us to make fully thoughtful decisions, even on many&nbsp;<br>personally relevant topics (Cohen, 1978; Milgram, 1970). That is, sometimes the issues&nbsp;<br>may be so complicated, the time so tight, the&nbsp;distractions so intrusive,&nbsp;the emotional&nbsp;<br>arousal so strong, or the mental fatigue so deep that we are in no cognitive condition to&nbsp;<br>operate mindfully. Important topic or&nbsp;not, we have to take the shortcut.5&nbsp;<br>
Perhaps nowhere is this last&nbsp;point&nbsp;driven home more dramatically&nbsp;than&nbsp;in the life-and-<br>death consequences of a phenomenon that airline industry officials have labeled&nbsp;<br><i>Captainitis&nbsp;</i>(Foushee, 1984). Accident investigators from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Federal Aviation&nbsp;<br>
5It's&nbsp;instructive that even though we often&nbsp;don't take a complex approach to personally&nbsp;<br>important topics, we wish our advisors—our physicians, accountants, lawyers, and&nbsp;<br>brokers—to do precisely that&nbsp;for us (Kahn &amp; Baron, 1995).&nbsp;When feeling overwhelmed&nbsp;<br>by a complicated and consequential choice, we&nbsp;still want&nbsp;a&nbsp;fully considered, point-by-<br>point analysis of it—an analysis we may&nbsp;not&nbsp;be able to achieve except, ironically&nbsp;<br>enough, through a shortcut:&nbsp;reliance on an expert.&nbsp;<br>

Administration have noted that, frequently,&nbsp;an obvious error made&nbsp;by a flight captain&nbsp;<br>was not corrected by the other crew members and resulted in a crash.&nbsp;It seems that,&nbsp;<br>despite the clear and strong personal importance of the issues, the crew members were&nbsp;<br>using the shortcut &quot;If an expert&nbsp;says so, it must be true&quot; rule in failing to attend&nbsp;or&nbsp;<br>respond to the captain's&nbsp;disastrous mistake (Harper, Kidera, &amp; Cullen, 1971).&nbsp;<br>
An account by John Watson, Jr., the former chairman of IBM, offers graphic evidence&nbsp;<br>of the phenomenon. During World War II, he was assigned to investigate plane crashes&nbsp;<br>in which high-ranking officers were killed&nbsp;or injured. One case involved a famous&nbsp;air.&nbsp;<br>force general named Uzal Ent whose copilot got&nbsp;sick before a flight. Ent was assigned a&nbsp;<br>replacement who felt honored to be flying&nbsp;alongside the legendary general. During&nbsp;<br>takeoff, Ent began singing to himself, nodding in time to a song in his head. The new&nbsp;<br>copilot interpreted the gesture as a signal&nbsp;to him&nbsp;to lift the wheels. Even though they&nbsp;<br>were going much too slowly to fly, he raised&nbsp;the landing gear, causing the plane to drop&nbsp;<br>immediately onto its belly. In the wreck, a&nbsp;propeller blade sliced into Ent's back,&nbsp;<br>severing his spine and rendering him&nbsp;a&nbsp;paraplegic. Watson (1990) described the&nbsp;<br>copilot's explanation for his action:&nbsp;<br>
<i>When I&nbsp;took&nbsp;the copilot's testimony, I asked&nbsp;him,&nbsp;&quot;If you knew the plane wasn 't going to&nbsp;<br>fly, why did you put the gear up ? &quot;</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>He said, &quot;I thought the general wanted&nbsp;me to.&quot; He was stupid, (p. 117)</i>&nbsp;<br>
Stupid?&nbsp;In that singular set of circumstances, yes. Understandable?&nbsp;In the shortcut-<br>demanding maze of modern life, also&nbsp;yes.&nbsp;<br>
<b>THE PROFITEERS</b>&nbsp;<br>
It is odd that despite their current widespread use and looming future importance, most&nbsp;<br>of us know very little about our&nbsp;automatic behavior patterns.&nbsp;Perhaps that is so precisely&nbsp;<br>because of the mechanistic, unthinking manner in which they occur.&nbsp;Whatever the&nbsp;<br>reason, it is vital that we clearly recognize one of&nbsp;their properties. They make us terribly&nbsp;<br>vulnerable to anyone who&nbsp;<i>does&nbsp;</i>know how they work.&nbsp;<br>
To understand fully the nature of our vulnerability, let us take another glance at the&nbsp;<br>work of the&nbsp;ethologists. It turns out that these animal behaviorists with their recorded&nbsp;<br>cheep-cheeps and their clumps of colored breast&nbsp;feathers are not the only ones who have&nbsp;<br>discovered how to activate the behavior&nbsp;tapes of various species. One group of&nbsp;<br>organisms, often termed&nbsp;<i>mimics,&nbsp;</i>copy the trigger features of&nbsp;other animals in an attempt&nbsp;<br>to trick these animals into mistakenly playing the right behavior tapes at the wrong&nbsp;<br>times. The mimics then exploit this altogether&nbsp;inappropriate action for their own benefit.&nbsp;<br>
Take, for example, the deadly trick played by&nbsp;the&nbsp;killer&nbsp;females of&nbsp;one genus of firefly&nbsp;<br><i>(Photuris)&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>on the males of another firefly genus&nbsp;<i>(Photinus).&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Understandably, the&nbsp;<br><i>Photinus&nbsp;</i>males scrupulously avoid contact with the bloodthirsty&nbsp;<i>Photuris&nbsp;</i>fe-&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

males. However, through centuries of natural selection, the&nbsp;<i>Photuris&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>female hunters&nbsp;<br>have located a weakness in&nbsp;their prey—a special blinking courtship code by which&nbsp;<br>members of the victims' species tell one another they are ready to mate. By mimicking&nbsp;<br>the flashing mating signals of her prey, the murderess is able to feast on the bodies of&nbsp;<br>males whose triggered courtship tapes cause them&nbsp;to fly mechanically into death's, not&nbsp;<br>love's, embrace (Lloyd, 1965).6&nbsp;<br>
In the struggle for survival, nearly every&nbsp;form&nbsp;of life has its mimics—right down to&nbsp;<br>some&nbsp;of the most primitive pathogens. By adopting certain critical&nbsp;features of useful&nbsp;<br>hormones or nutrients, these clever bacteria&nbsp;and viruses can gain entry into a healthy&nbsp;<br>host cell.&nbsp;The result is that the healthy cell&nbsp;eagerly and naively sweeps into&nbsp;itself&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>causes of such diseases as rabies,&nbsp;mononucleosis, and the common cold (Goodenough,&nbsp;<br>1991).7&nbsp;It should come&nbsp;as no surprise, then, that&nbsp;there is a strong but sad parallel in the&nbsp;<br>human jungle. We too have profiteers who mimic trigger features for our own brand of&nbsp;<br>automatic responding. Unlike the mostly instinctive response sequences of nonhumans,&nbsp;<br>however, our automatic tapes usually develop from&nbsp;psychological principles or&nbsp;<br>stereotypes we have learned to&nbsp;accept. Although they&nbsp;vary in their force, some&nbsp;of these&nbsp;<br>principles possess a tremendous ability to direct human action. We&nbsp;have been subjected&nbsp;<br>to them&nbsp;from such an early point in our&nbsp;lives, and they have moved us about so&nbsp;<br>pervasively since then, that you&nbsp;and I rarely perceive their power. In the eyes of others,&nbsp;<br>though, each such principle is&nbsp;a detectable and ready weapon, a weapon of automatic&nbsp;<br>influence.&nbsp;<br>
There are some&nbsp;people who know very well&nbsp;where the weapons of&nbsp;automatic influence&nbsp;<br>lie and who employ them&nbsp;regularly and expertly to get what they want. They go from&nbsp;<br>social encounter to social encounter, requesting others to comply with their wishes; their&nbsp;<br>frequency of success is dazzling. The secret of&nbsp;their effectiveness lies in&nbsp;the way that&nbsp;<br>they structure their requests, the way that they arm&nbsp;themselves with one or another&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>the weapons of influence that&nbsp;exist is the social environment. To do this may take no&nbsp;<br>more than one correctly chosen word that&nbsp;engages a strong psychological principle and&nbsp;<br>sets rolling one of our automatic behavior tapes. Trust the&nbsp;<br>
Apparently, the tendency of males to&nbsp;be bamboozled by powerful mating signals&nbsp;<br>extends to humans. Two University of Vienna biologists, Astrid Juette and Karl&nbsp;<br>Grammer secretly exposed young men to airborne chemicals (called copulins) that&nbsp;<br>mimic human vaginal scents. The men then&nbsp;rated the attractiveness of women's faces.&nbsp;<br>Exposure to the copulins increased the judged attractiveness of all the women and&nbsp;<br>masked the genuine physical attractiveness differences among them&nbsp;(&quot;For Women,&quot;&nbsp;<br>1999).&nbsp;<br>
7As exploitative as these creatures seem, they are topped in&nbsp;this respect by an insect&nbsp;<br>known as the rove beetle. By using a variety&nbsp;of triggers involving smell and touch, the&nbsp;<br>rove beetles&nbsp;get two species of&nbsp;ants to protect,&nbsp;groom, and feed them&nbsp;as larvae and&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>harbor them for the winter as adults. Responding mechanically to&nbsp;the beetles'&nbsp;trick&nbsp;<br>trigger features, the ants treat the beetles as though they were fellow ants. Inside the ant&nbsp;<br>nests, the beetles respond to&nbsp;their hosts'&nbsp;hospitality by&nbsp;eating ant eggs and young; yet&nbsp;<br>they are never harmed (Holldobler, 1971).&nbsp;<br>

human profiteers to learn quickly exactly how&nbsp;to benefit from our tendency to respond&nbsp;<br>mechanically according to these principles.&nbsp;<br>
Remember my friend the jewelry store owner?&nbsp;Although she benefited&nbsp;by accident the&nbsp;<br>first time, it did not take&nbsp;her long to begin exploiting the expensive =&nbsp;good stereotype&nbsp;<br>regularly and intentionally. Now during the tourist season, she first tries to speed the&nbsp;<br>sale of an item that has been difficult to&nbsp;move by increasing&nbsp;its price substantially. She&nbsp;<br>claims that this is marvelously cost-effective. When it works on the unsuspecting&nbsp;<br>vacationers—as it frequently does—it results in an enormous profit margin.&nbsp;<br>
And even when it is&nbsp;not initially&nbsp;successful, she can then mark the article &quot;Reduced&quot;&nbsp;<br>and sell it to bargain-hunters at its original&nbsp;price while still taking advantage of their&nbsp;<br>expensive = good reaction to&nbsp;the inflated figure.&nbsp;<br>
By no means is my&nbsp;friend original in this last use of the expensive = good rule to snare&nbsp;<br>those seeking a bargain. Culturist and author Leo Rosten gives the example of the&nbsp;<br>Drubeck brothers, Sid and Harry, who owned a men's&nbsp;tailor shop in Rosten's&nbsp;<br>neighborhood in the 1930s. Whenever Sid had a&nbsp;new customer trying&nbsp;on suits in front of&nbsp;<br>the shop's three-sided mirror, he would admit to a hearing problem&nbsp;and repeatedly&nbsp;<br>request that the man speak more loudly to&nbsp;him. Once the customer had found a suit he&nbsp;<br>liked and&nbsp;asked for the price, Sid would call to&nbsp;his brother, the head tailor, at the back of&nbsp;<br>the room, &quot;Harry, how much for this suit?&quot; Looking up from&nbsp;his work— and greatly&nbsp;<br>exaggerating the suit's true&nbsp;price—Harry would call back, &quot;For that&nbsp;beautiful, all wool&nbsp;<br>suit, forty-two dollars.&quot; Pretending not to&nbsp;have heard and cupping&nbsp;his hand to his ear,&nbsp;<br>Sid would ask again. Once more Harry would reply, &quot;Forty-two dollars.&quot; At this point,&nbsp;<br>Sid would turn to the customer and report,&nbsp;&quot;He says twenty-two dollars.&quot; Many a man&nbsp;<br>would hurry to buy the suit and scramble out of the&nbsp;shop with his&nbsp;expensive = good&nbsp;<br>bargain before poor Sid discovered the &quot;mistake.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<b>JUJITSU</b>&nbsp;<br>
A woman employing the Japanese martial art form called jujitsu would use her own&nbsp;<br>strength only minimally against an opponent. Instead, she would exploit the power&nbsp;<br>inherent&nbsp;in&nbsp;such naturally present principles as gravity, leverage, momentum, and&nbsp;<br>inertia. If she knows how and where to engage&nbsp;the action of these principles she can&nbsp;<br>easily defeat a physically stronger rival. And so&nbsp;it is for the exploiters of the weapons of&nbsp;<br>automatic influence that exist naturally around us. The profiteers can commission the&nbsp;<br>power of these weapons for use against their&nbsp;targets while exerting little personal force.&nbsp;<br>This last&nbsp;feature of the process gives&nbsp;the profiteers an enormous additional benefit— the&nbsp;<br>ability to manipulate without the appearance of manipulation. Even the victims&nbsp;<br>themselves tend to&nbsp;see their compliance as&nbsp;a result of&nbsp;the action of&nbsp;natural forces rather&nbsp;<br>than the designs of the person who profits from&nbsp;that compliance.&nbsp;<br>
An example is in order. There is a principle in human perception, the contrast principle,&nbsp;<br>that affects the way we see the difference between two things that are pre-&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

sented one after another.&nbsp;Simply put, if&nbsp;the&nbsp;second&nbsp;item&nbsp;is fairly different from&nbsp;the first,&nbsp;<br>we will tend&nbsp;to see it as&nbsp;<i>more&nbsp;</i>different than it actually&nbsp;is.&nbsp;So if&nbsp;we lift a&nbsp;light object first&nbsp;<br>and then lift a heavy object, we will estimate&nbsp;the second object to be heavier than if we&nbsp;<br>had lifted it without first lifting the light one. The contrast principle is well established&nbsp;<br>in the field of psychophysics and&nbsp;applies to all sorts&nbsp;of perceptions besides weight. If we&nbsp;<br>are talking&nbsp;to a very&nbsp;attractive individual&nbsp;at a party and are then&nbsp;joined by&nbsp;an&nbsp;<br>unattractive individual, the second&nbsp;will strike us as less attractive than he&nbsp;or she actually&nbsp;<br>is.8&nbsp;<br>
Another demonstration of perceptual contrast is sometimes employed in psychophysics&nbsp;<br>laboratories to introduce students to&nbsp;the principle. Each student takes a turn sitting&nbsp;in&nbsp;<br>front of three pails of water—one cold, one&nbsp;at room&nbsp;temperature, and one hot. After&nbsp;<br>placing one hand in the cold water and one in the hot water, the student is told to place&nbsp;<br>both hands in the room-temperature water simultaneously. The look of amused&nbsp;<br>bewilderment that immediately registers tells the story:&nbsp;Even though both hands are in&nbsp;<br>the same&nbsp;bucket, the hand that has been in the cold water feels&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it is now in hot&nbsp;<br>water, while&nbsp;the one&nbsp;that&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the&nbsp;hot water feels as if&nbsp;it is now in cold water. The&nbsp;<br>point is that the same&nbsp;thing—in this instance, room-temperature water—can be made to&nbsp;<br>seem&nbsp;very different depending on the nature of the event that precedes it.&nbsp;<br>
Be assured that the nice little weapon of influence provided by the contrast principle&nbsp;<br>does not go unexploited. The great&nbsp;advantage of this principle is not only that it works&nbsp;<br>but also that it is virtually undetectable. Those who employ it can cash in on its&nbsp;<br>influence without any appearance of having structured the situation in their favor. Retail&nbsp;<br>clothiers are a good example. Suppose a man enters a fashionable men's store and says&nbsp;<br>that he wants to buy a three-piece suit and&nbsp;a sweater. If you were the salesperson, which&nbsp;<br>would you show him&nbsp;first to make him&nbsp;likely&nbsp;to spend the most money?&nbsp;Clothing stores&nbsp;<br>instruct their sales personnel to sell the costly item&nbsp;first. Common sense might suggest&nbsp;<br>the reverse:&nbsp;If&nbsp;a man has just spent a lot of money to purchase a suit, he may be&nbsp;<br>reluctant to&nbsp;spend much more on the purchase of a sweater; but the&nbsp;clothiers&nbsp;know&nbsp;<br>better. They behave in&nbsp;accordance with what the contrast principle would suggest: Sell&nbsp;<br>the suit first,&nbsp;because when it comes time to&nbsp;look at sweaters, even expensive ones, their&nbsp;<br>prices&nbsp;will not&nbsp;<i>seem&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>as high in comparison. The same&nbsp;principle applies to a man who&nbsp;<br>wishes to buy the accessories (shirt, shoes,&nbsp;belt) to go along with&nbsp;his new suit. Contrary&nbsp;<br>to the commonsense view, the evidence supports the contrast principle prediction.&nbsp;<br>According to sales motivation analysts&nbsp;<br>
8Some&nbsp;researchers warn that the unrealistically attractive people portrayed in the&nbsp;<br>popular media (actors, actresses, models) may&nbsp;cause us to be less satisfied with the&nbsp;<br>looks of the genuinely available romantic possibilities&nbsp;around us. For instance, one&nbsp;<br>study demonstrated that exposure to the exaggerated sexual attractiveness of nude pinup&nbsp;<br>bodies (in such magazines as&nbsp;<i>Playboy&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Play girl)&nbsp;</i>causes people to become less&nbsp;<br>pleased with the sexual desirability of their current spouse or live-in mate (Kenrick,&nbsp;<br>Gutierres, &amp; Goldberg, 1989).&nbsp;<br>

Whitney, Hubin, and Murphy (1965), &quot;The interesting thing is that even when a man&nbsp;<br>enters a clothing store with the express purpose of&nbsp;purchasing a suit,&nbsp;he will almost&nbsp;<br>always&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>pay more&nbsp;</i>for whatever accessories he buys&nbsp;if he buys them&nbsp;after the suit&nbsp;<br>purchase than before.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
It is much more profitable for salespeople to&nbsp;present the expensive item&nbsp;first; to fail to&nbsp;<br>do so will lose the influence of&nbsp;the contrast&nbsp;principle and will also cause the principle to&nbsp;<br>work actively against them. Presenting an&nbsp;inexpensive product first and following it&nbsp;<br>with an expensive one&nbsp;will make the expensive item&nbsp;seem even more costly as a&nbsp;<br>result—hardly a desirable consequence for most&nbsp;sales organizations. So, just as it is&nbsp;<br>possible to make the same&nbsp;bucket of water appear to be hotter or&nbsp;colder depending on&nbsp;<br>the temperature of previously presented water, it is possible to&nbsp;make the price of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>same item&nbsp;seem&nbsp;higher or lower depending on the price of a previously presented item.&nbsp;<br>
Clever use of&nbsp;perceptual contrast&nbsp;is by&nbsp;no&nbsp;means confined to clothiers. (See Figure 1.1.)&nbsp;<br>I came across a technique that engaged the contrast principle while I was investigating,&nbsp;<br>undercover, the compliance tactics of real estate companies. To &quot;learn the ropes,&quot; I&nbsp;<br>accompanied a salesman on a weekend of showing houses to prospective home buyers.&nbsp;<br>The salesman—we can call him&nbsp;Phil—was to give me&nbsp;tips to help me&nbsp;through my&nbsp;<br>break-in period. One thing I quickly noticed&nbsp;was that whenever Phil began showing a&nbsp;<br>new set of customers potential buys, he would start with a couple of undesirable houses.&nbsp;<br>I asked him&nbsp;about it, and he laughed. They were what he called &quot;setup&quot; properties. The&nbsp;<br>company maintained a run-down house or two on its&nbsp;lists&nbsp;at inflated&nbsp;prices. These&nbsp;<br>houses were not intended to be sold to customers but only to be shown to them, so that&nbsp;<br>the genuine properties in the company's inventory would benefit from&nbsp;the comparison.&nbsp;<br>Not all the sales&nbsp;staff&nbsp;made use of&nbsp;the&nbsp;setup houses, but Phil did. He said he liked to&nbsp;<br>watch his prospects'&nbsp;&quot;eyes light up&quot; when&nbsp;<br>

he showed the places he really wanted to sell&nbsp;them&nbsp;after they had seen the rundown&nbsp;<br>houses. &quot;The house I got them&nbsp;spotted for looks&nbsp;really great after they've first looked at&nbsp;<br>a couple of dumps.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Automobile dealers use the contrast principle by waiting until the price of a car has been&nbsp;<br>negotiated before suggesting one option after&nbsp;another. In the wake of a many-thousand-<br>dollar deal, the hundred or&nbsp;so dollars extra for a nicety&nbsp;like a CD player seems almost&nbsp;<br>trivial in comparison. The same will be true&nbsp;of the added expense of accessories like&nbsp;<br>tinted windows, dual side-view mirrors, better tires, or special trim&nbsp;that the dealer might&nbsp;<br>suggest in sequence. The trick&nbsp;is to bring up the options independently of one another so&nbsp;<br>that each small price will seem&nbsp;petty when&nbsp;compared to the already determined much&nbsp;<br>larger price. As veteran car buyers can attest, many a budget-sized final price figure has&nbsp;<br>ballooned out of proportion from&nbsp;the addition of all those seemingly little options.&nbsp;<br>While the customers stand, signed contract in hand, wondering what happened and&nbsp;<br>finding no one to blame but themselves, the&nbsp;car dealer stands smiling the knowing smile&nbsp;<br>of&nbsp;the jujitsu&nbsp;master.&nbsp;<br>
<b>READER'S&nbsp;REPORT 1.2</b>&nbsp;<br>
<b>From a University of Chicago Business School Student</b>&nbsp;<br>
While waiting to board a flight at O'Hare,&nbsp;I heard a desk agent announce that the flight&nbsp;<br>was overbooked and that, if passengers were willing to take a later plane, they would be&nbsp;<br>compensated with a voucher worth $10,000! Of&nbsp;course, this exaggerated amount was a&nbsp;<br>joke. It was supposed to make people laugh. It&nbsp;did. But I noticed that when he then&nbsp;<br>revealed the&nbsp;<i>actual&nbsp;</i>offer (a $200 voucher), there were no takers. In fact, he had to raise&nbsp;<br>the offer twice, to $300 and then $500, before&nbsp;he got any volunteers. I was reading your&nbsp;<br>book at the time, and I realized that, although&nbsp;he got his laugh, according&nbsp;to the contrast&nbsp;<br>principle he screwed up. He'd&nbsp;arranged things so that compared to $10,000, a couple&nbsp;<br>hundred bucks seemed like a pittance. That was&nbsp;an expensive laugh. It cost&nbsp;his airline an&nbsp;<br>extra $300 per volunteer.&nbsp;<br>
<i>Author's note: Any ideas on how the desk agent could have used the contrast principle&nbsp;<br>to his advantage rather than his detriment?&nbsp;Perhaps he could have started with a $5&nbsp;<br>joke offer and then revealed the true&nbsp;(and now much more attractive-sounding)&nbsp;$200&nbsp;<br>amount. Under those circumstances, I'm pretty&nbsp;sure he would have secured his laugh&nbsp;<br>and his volunteers.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<b>SUMMARY</b>&nbsp;<br>
Ethologists, researchers who study animal behavior in the natural environment, have&nbsp;<br>noticed that among&nbsp;many animal species&nbsp;behavior often occurs in rigid and&nbsp;<br>

mechanical patterns. Called&nbsp;<b>fixed-action patterns,&nbsp;</b>these mechanical behavior&nbsp;<br>sequences are noteworthy in&nbsp;their similarity&nbsp;to certain&nbsp;automatic&nbsp;<i>(click, whirr)&nbsp;<br></i>responding by humans. For both humans and subhumans, the automatic behavior&nbsp;<br>patterns tend to be triggered by a single feature of&nbsp;the relevant information in the&nbsp;<br>situation. This single feature, or trigger&nbsp;feature, can often prove very valuable by&nbsp;<br>allowing an individual to decide on a correct course of action without having to analyze&nbsp;<br>carefully and completely each of the other pieces of information in the situation.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;The advantage of such shortcut responding lies in its efficiency and economy;&nbsp;by&nbsp;<br>reacting automatically to a usually&nbsp;informative trigger feature, an&nbsp;individual preserves&nbsp;<br>crucial time, energy, and mental capacity. The disadvantage of such responding lies in&nbsp;<br>its vulnerability to silly and costly mistakes; by&nbsp;reacting to only a piece&nbsp;of&nbsp;the available&nbsp;<br>information (even a normally predictive piece),&nbsp;an individual increases the chances of&nbsp;<br>error, especially when responding in an automatic, mindless fashion. The chances of&nbsp;<br>error increase even further when other individuals seek to profit by arranging (through&nbsp;<br>manipulation of trigger features) to stimulate a desired behavior at inappropriate times.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;Much of the compliance process&nbsp;(wherein&nbsp;one person is spurred to comply with&nbsp;<br>another person's request) can be understood in terms of a human tendency for&nbsp;<br>automatic, shortcut responding. Most individuals&nbsp;in our culture have developed a set of&nbsp;<br>trigger features for compliance, that is, a&nbsp;set of specific pieces of information that&nbsp;<br>normally tell us when compliance with a request is likely to be correct and beneficial.&nbsp;<br>Each of these trigger features for compliance can be used like a weapon (of influence)&nbsp;<br>to stimulate people to agree to requests.&nbsp;<br>

—RALPH WALDO EMERSON&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=30></a>Several years ago, a university professor tried a little experiment. He sent Christmas&nbsp;<br>cards to a sample of&nbsp;perfect strangers. Although he expected some reaction, the&nbsp;<br>response he received was amazing—holiday cards addressed to him&nbsp;came&nbsp;pouring back&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;people who had never met nor heard of&nbsp;him. The great majority of those who&nbsp;<br>returned cards never inquired&nbsp;into the identity of&nbsp;the unknown professor. They received&nbsp;<br>his holiday greeting card,&nbsp;<i>click,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>whirr,&nbsp;</i>they automatically sent cards in return&nbsp;(Kunz&nbsp;<br>&amp; Woolcott, 1976).&nbsp;<br>
While small in scope, this study shows the&nbsp;action of one of the&nbsp;most&nbsp;potent of the&nbsp;<br>weapons of influence around us—the rule of reciprocation. The rule&nbsp;says that we should&nbsp;<br>try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us. If a woman does us a favor,&nbsp;<br>we should do her one in return; if a man sends us a birthday present, we should&nbsp;<br>remember his birthday with a gift of our own; if a couple invites us to a party, we&nbsp;<br>should be sure to invite them&nbsp;to one of ours. By virtue of&nbsp;the reciprocity rule, then, we&nbsp;<br>are&nbsp;<i>obligated&nbsp;</i>to the future repayment of&nbsp;favors, gifts, invitations, and the like. So typical&nbsp;<br>is it for indebtedness to accompany the receipt of&nbsp;such things that a phrase like &quot;much&nbsp;<br>obliged&quot; has become&nbsp;a synonym&nbsp;for &quot;thank you,&quot; not only in the English language but&nbsp;<br>in others as well.&nbsp;<br>
The impressive aspect of reciprocation with&nbsp;its accompanying sense of obligation is its&nbsp;<br>pervasiveness in human culture. It is so&nbsp;widespread that, after intensive study, Alvin&nbsp;<br>Gouldner (1960), along with other sociologists,&nbsp;report that all human societies subscribe&nbsp;<br>to the rule.1&nbsp;Within each society it seems pervasive also; it permeates&nbsp;exchanges of&nbsp;<br>every kind. Indeed, it may well be that a developed system of indebtedness flowing&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;the rule of reciprocation is a unique property of human culture. The noted&nbsp;<br>archaeologist&nbsp;Richard Leakey ascribes the essence of what makes us&nbsp;human to the&nbsp;<br>reciprocity system. He claims that we are&nbsp;human because our ancestors learned to share&nbsp;<br>food and skills &quot;in an honored network of&nbsp;obligation&quot; (Leakey &amp; Lewin, 1978). Cultural&nbsp;<br>anthropologists view this &quot;web of indebtedness&quot; as a unique adaptive mechanism of&nbsp;<br>human beings, allowing for the division of&nbsp;labor, the exchange&nbsp;of diverse forms of&nbsp;<br>goods and different services, and the creation of&nbsp;<br>
Certain societies have formalized the rule into ritual. Consider for example the Vartan&nbsp;<br>Bhanji, an&nbsp;institutionalized custom&nbsp;of&nbsp;gift&nbsp;exchange common to parts&nbsp;of&nbsp;Pakistan and&nbsp;<br>India. In commenting upon the Vartan&nbsp;Bhanji, Gouldner (1960) remarks:&nbsp;<br>
<i>It is .&nbsp;.. notable that the system&nbsp;painstakingly prevents the total elimination of&nbsp;<br>outstanding obligations. Thus, on the occasion of a marriage, departing guests are&nbsp;<br>given gifts of&nbsp;sweets. In weighing them out, the hostess may say, &quot;These five are yours,&quot;&nbsp;<br>meaning &quot;These are a repayment&nbsp;for what you formerly gave me,&quot; and then she adds an&nbsp;<br>extra measure, saying, &quot;These are mine.&quot; On the next occasion, she will receive these&nbsp;<br>back along with an additional measure which&nbsp;she later returns, and so on.

interdependencies that bind individuals together into highly efficient units (Ridley,&nbsp;<br>1997; Tiger &amp; Fox, 1989).&nbsp;<br>
It is a sense&nbsp;of&nbsp;future obligation that is critical&nbsp;to produce social&nbsp;advances of&nbsp;the sort&nbsp;<br>described by Tiger and Fox. A widely shared and strongly held feeling of future&nbsp;<br>obligation made an enormous difference in human social evolution because it meant that&nbsp;<br>one person could give something (for example,&nbsp;food, energy, care) to another with&nbsp;<br>confidence that the gift was not being lost. For the&nbsp;first&nbsp;tune&nbsp;in&nbsp;evolutionary&nbsp;history, one&nbsp;<br>individual could give away&nbsp;any of a variety of resources without actually giving them&nbsp;<br>away. The result was the lowering of&nbsp;the natural inhibitions against transactions that&nbsp;<br>must be&nbsp;<i>begun&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>by one person's providing personal resources to another. Sophisticated&nbsp;<br>and coordinated systems of aid, gift giving, defense, and trade became&nbsp;possible,&nbsp;<br>bringing immense benefits to the societies that possessed them. With such clearly&nbsp;<br>adaptive consequences for the culture, it is not&nbsp;surprising that the rule for reciprocation&nbsp;<br>is so deeply implanted in us by the process of socialization we all undergo. I know of no&nbsp;<br>better illustration of the way reciprocal obligations can reach&nbsp;long and powerfully into&nbsp;<br>the future than the perplexing story of $5,000&nbsp;of relief aid that was exchanged between&nbsp;<br>Mexico and Ethiopia. In 1985, Ethiopia could justly lay claim&nbsp;to the greatest suffering&nbsp;<br>and privation in the world. Its economy was&nbsp;in ruin. Its food supply had been ravaged&nbsp;<br>by years of drought and internal war. Its inhabitants were dying&nbsp;by the thousands from&nbsp;<br>disease and starvation. Under&nbsp;these circumstances, I would not&nbsp;have been surprised to&nbsp;<br>learn of a $5,000 relief&nbsp;donation from&nbsp;Mexico&nbsp;to that wrenchingly needy country. I&nbsp;<br>remember my feeling of amazement, though,&nbsp;when a brief newspaper item&nbsp;I was&nbsp;<br>reading insisted that the aid had gone in&nbsp;the opposite direction. Native officials of the&nbsp;<br>Ethiopian Red Cross had decided to send the money to help the victims of that year's&nbsp;<br>earthquakes in Mexico City.&nbsp;<br>
It is both a personal bane and a professional&nbsp;blessing that whenever I am confused by&nbsp;<br>some aspect of human behavior, I feel driven&nbsp;to investigate further.&nbsp;In this instance, I&nbsp;<br>was able to track down a fuller account of&nbsp;the story. Fortunately, a journalist who had&nbsp;<br>been as bewildered&nbsp;as I by the Ethiopians'&nbsp;actions had asked for an explanation. The&nbsp;<br>answer he received offered eloquent validation&nbsp;of the reciprocity&nbsp;rule: Despite the&nbsp;<br>enormous needs prevailing in Ethiopia, the money was being sent to Mexico because, in&nbsp;<br>1935, Mexico had sent aid to Ethiopia when&nbsp;it was invaded by Italy (&quot;Ethiopian Red&nbsp;<br>Cross,&quot; 1985). So informed, I remained awed, but I was no longer puzzled. The need to&nbsp;<br>reciprocate had transcended great cultural differences, long&nbsp;distances,&nbsp;acute famine,&nbsp;<br>many years, and immediate self-interest. Quite&nbsp;simply, a half-century later, against all&nbsp;<br>countervailing forces, obligation triumphed.&nbsp;<br>
<b>HOW THE RULE WORKS</b>&nbsp;<br>
Make no mistake, human societies derive a truly significant competitive advantage from&nbsp;<br>the reciprocity rule and,&nbsp;consequently, they make sure&nbsp;their members are trained to&nbsp;<br>comply with and believe in it. Each of us&nbsp;has been taught to live up to the rule,&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<a name=32></a>22&nbsp;<i>Chapter 2</i>&nbsp;<br>
and each of us knows the social sanctions and derision applied to anyone who violates&nbsp;<br>it. Because there is a general distaste for those who take and make no effort to give in&nbsp;<br>return, we will often go to great lengths to avoid being considered a moocher, ingrate,&nbsp;<br>or freeloader. It is to those lengths that we&nbsp;will often be taken and, in the process, be&nbsp;<br>&quot;taken&quot; by individuals who stand to&nbsp;gain from&nbsp;our indebtedness.&nbsp;<br>
To understand how the rule of reciprocation can be exploited by one who recognizes it&nbsp;<br>as the weapon of influence it certainly is, we might closely examine an experiment&nbsp;<br>conducted by psychologist Dennis Regan (1971). A subject who participated in the&nbsp;<br>study rated, along with another&nbsp;subject, the quality of some&nbsp;paintings as part of an&nbsp;<br>experiment on &quot;art appreciation.&quot; The other rater—we can call him&nbsp;Joe—was only&nbsp;<br>posing as a fellow subject and was actually&nbsp;Dr. Regan's assistant. For our purposes, the&nbsp;<br>experiment took place under two different conditions. In some&nbsp;cases, Joe did a small,&nbsp;<br>unsolicited favor for the true subject. During a short rest period, Joe left the room&nbsp;for a&nbsp;<br>couple of minutes and returned with&nbsp;two bottles&nbsp;of Coca-Cola, one for the subject and&nbsp;<br>one for himself, saying &quot;I asked him&nbsp;[the experimenter] if I could get myself a Coke,&nbsp;<br>and he said it was OK, so I bought one for&nbsp;you, too.&quot; In other cases, Joe did not provide&nbsp;<br>the subject with a favor; he simply returned from the two-minute break empty-handed.&nbsp;<br>In all other respects, however, Joe behaved identically.&nbsp;<br>
Later on,&nbsp;after the paintings&nbsp;had all been rated&nbsp;and the experimenter had momentarily&nbsp;<br>left the room, Joe asked the subject to do&nbsp;<i>him&nbsp;</i>a favor. He indicated that he was selling&nbsp;<br>raffle tickets for a new car and that if he sold the most tickets, he would win a $50 prize.&nbsp;<br>Joe's request was for the subject to buy some&nbsp;raffle tickets at 25 cents apiece: &quot;Any&nbsp;<br>would help, the more the better.&quot; The major&nbsp;finding of the study concerns the number of&nbsp;<br>tickets subjects purchased from&nbsp;Joe under&nbsp;the two conditions. Without question, Joe was&nbsp;<br>more successful in selling his raffle tickets&nbsp;to&nbsp;the subjects who had received his earlier&nbsp;<br>favor. Apparently feeling that they owed&nbsp;him&nbsp;something, these subjects bought twice as&nbsp;<br>many tickets as the subjects who had not&nbsp;been given the prior favor. Although the&nbsp;<br>Regan study represents a fairly simple demonstration of&nbsp;the workings of&nbsp;the rule of&nbsp;<br>reciprocation, it illustrates several important characteristics of the rule&nbsp;that, upon further&nbsp;<br>consideration, help us to understand how it may be profitably used.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>The Rule Is Overpowering</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
One of the reasons&nbsp;reciprocation can be used so effectively as a device for gaining&nbsp;<br>another's compliance is its power. The&nbsp;rule possesses awesome strength, often&nbsp;<br>producing a yes response to&nbsp;a request that, except for an existing feeling of&nbsp;<br>indebtedness, would have surely been refused. Some&nbsp;evidence of how the rule's force&nbsp;<br>can overpower the influence of other factors that normally determine compliance with a&nbsp;<br>request can be seen in a second result of the Regan study.&nbsp;Besides his interest in the&nbsp;<br>impact of the reciprocity&nbsp;rule on compliance, Regan was also investigating how liking&nbsp;<br>for a person affects the tendency to comply&nbsp;with that person's request. To mea-&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<a name=33></a><i>Reciprocation&nbsp;</i>23&nbsp;<br>
sure how liking toward Joe affected the subjects'&nbsp;decisions to buy&nbsp;his raffle tickets,&nbsp;<br>Regan had them&nbsp;fill out several rating scales&nbsp;indicating how much they had liked Joe.&nbsp;<br>He then compared their liking responses with&nbsp;the number of tickets they had purchased&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;Joe. There was a significant tendency for&nbsp;subjects to buy more&nbsp;raffle tickets&nbsp;from&nbsp;<br>Joe the more they liked&nbsp;him.&nbsp;This alone is hardly a startling finding, since most of us&nbsp;<br>would have guessed that&nbsp;people are more willing to do a favor for someone they like.&nbsp;<br>
The interesting finding of the Regan experiment, however, was that the relationship&nbsp;<br>between liking and compliance was completely&nbsp;wiped out in the condition under which&nbsp;<br>subjects had been given a Coke by Joe. For those who owed&nbsp;him a favor, it made no&nbsp;<br>difference whether they liked him&nbsp;or not; they&nbsp;felt a sense of&nbsp;obligation&nbsp;to repay&nbsp;him,&nbsp;<br>and they did. The subjects who indicated that&nbsp;they disliked Joe bought just as many of&nbsp;<br>his tickets as did those who indicated that&nbsp;they&nbsp;liked&nbsp;him.&nbsp;The rule&nbsp;for reciprocity was&nbsp;<br>so strong that it simply overwhelmed the influence of a factor— liking for the&nbsp;<br>requester—that normally affects the decision to comply.&nbsp;<br>
Think of the implications. People we might&nbsp;ordinarily dislike—unsavory or unwelcome&nbsp;<br>sales operators, disagreeable acquaintances, representatives of strange or unpopular&nbsp;<br>organizations—can greatly increase the chance&nbsp;that we will do what they wish merely&nbsp;<br>by providing&nbsp;us with a small favor prior to their requests. Let's take a recent historical&nbsp;<br>example. The Hare Krishna Society is an Eastern religious sect with&nbsp;centuries-old roots&nbsp;<br>traceable to the Indian city of&nbsp;Calcutta. Its&nbsp;spectacular modern-day&nbsp;story occurred in the&nbsp;<br>1970s when it experienced a remarkable growth, not only in followers, but also in&nbsp;<br>wealth and property. The economic growth was funded through a variety of activities,&nbsp;<br>the principal and most visible of which&nbsp;was society members'&nbsp;requests for donations&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;passers by in public places. During the&nbsp;early history of the group in this country,&nbsp;<br>the solicitation for contributions was attempted in a fashion memorable for anyone who&nbsp;<br>saw it. Groups of Krishna devotees—often with&nbsp;shaved heads, and wearing ill-fitting&nbsp;<br>robes, leg wrappings, beads, and bells—&nbsp;would canvass a city street, chanting and&nbsp;<br>bobbing in unison while begging for funds.&nbsp;<br>
Although highly effective as an attention-getting technique, this practice did not work&nbsp;<br>especially well for fund-raising. The average&nbsp;American considered the Krishnas weird,&nbsp;<br>to say the least, and was&nbsp;reluctant to&nbsp;provide money to support them. It quickly became&nbsp;<br>clear to the society that it&nbsp;had a considerable public-relations problem. The people being&nbsp;<br>asked for contributions did not like the way the members looked, dressed, or acted. Had&nbsp;<br>the society been an ordinary commercial&nbsp;organization, the solution would have been&nbsp;<br>simple—change the things the public does not like. The Krishnas are a religious&nbsp;<br>organization, however, and the way members look, dress, and act is partially tied to&nbsp;<br>religious factors. Since religious factors are typically resistant to&nbsp;change because of&nbsp;<br>worldly considerations, the Krishna leadership&nbsp;was faced with a real dilemma.&nbsp;On the&nbsp;<br>one hand were beliefs, modes of dress, and hairstyles that had&nbsp;religious significance.&nbsp;On&nbsp;<br>the other, and threatening the organization's financial welfare, were the less-than-<br>positive feelings of&nbsp;the American public toward&nbsp;these things. What's a sect to do?&nbsp;<br>

<i>Reciprocation 24&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;<br>
The Krishnas'&nbsp;resolution&nbsp;was brilliant. They switched to a fund-raising tactic that made&nbsp;<br>it unnecessary for their targets to have positive feelings toward the fundraisers. They&nbsp;<br>began to employ a donation-request procedure&nbsp;that engaged the rule for reciprocation,&nbsp;<br>which, as demonstrated by the Regan study,&nbsp;was strong enough to overcome dislike for&nbsp;<br>the requester. The new strategy&nbsp;still involved the solicitation of contributions in public&nbsp;<br>places with much pedestrian traffic (airports&nbsp;were a favorite),&nbsp;but, before a donation was&nbsp;<br>requested, the target person was given a &quot;gift&quot;—a book&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
(usually the&nbsp;<i>Bhagavod Gita),&nbsp;</i>the&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Back to Godhead&nbsp;</i>magazine of the society, or, in the&nbsp;<br>most cost-effective version, a flower. The unsuspecting passersby who suddenly found&nbsp;<br>flowers pressed into their hands or pinned&nbsp;to their jackets were&nbsp;under no circumstances&nbsp;<br>allowed to give them&nbsp;back, even if they asserted&nbsp;that they did not want them. &quot;No, it is&nbsp;<br>our gift to you,&quot; said the solicitor, refusing to take it back. Only after the Krishna&nbsp;<br>member had thus brought the force of the reciprocation rule to bear&nbsp;on the situation was&nbsp;<br>the target asked to provide a contribution to&nbsp;the society. This bene-factor-before-beggar&nbsp;<br>strategy was wildly successful for the Hare Krishna Society, producing large-scale&nbsp;<br>economic gains and funding, the ownership of&nbsp;temples, businesses, houses, and property&nbsp;<br>in 321 centers in the United States and abroad.&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=35></a><i>Reciprocation 25&nbsp;</i><br>
As an aside,&nbsp;it is instructive that&nbsp;the reciprocation&nbsp;rule has outlived&nbsp;its usefulness for the&nbsp;<br>Krishnas, not because the rule itself has become&nbsp;any less potent societally, but because&nbsp;<br>we have found ways to prevent the Krishnas from&nbsp;using it on us. After once falling&nbsp;<br>victim&nbsp;to their tactic, many travelers became alert to the presence of robed Krishna&nbsp;<br>Society solicitors in airports and train stations, adjusting&nbsp;their paths&nbsp;to avoid an&nbsp;<br>encounter and preparing beforehand to ward&nbsp;off a solicitor's &quot;gift.&quot; Although the society&nbsp;<br>tried to counter this increased vigilance&nbsp;by instructing members to be dressed and&nbsp;<br>groomed in modern styles to avoid immediate recognition&nbsp;when soliciting (some&nbsp;<br>actually carried flight bags or suitcases), even disguise did not work especially well for&nbsp;<br>the Krishnas. Too many individuals now&nbsp;know better than to&nbsp;accept unrequested&nbsp;<br>offerings in public places such as airports. In addition, after a flood of complaints,&nbsp;<br>airports began banning the Society's fund-raising&nbsp;efforts from their premises.&nbsp;<br>
As a result,&nbsp;the Krishnas experienced a severe financial reversal. In North America,&nbsp;<br>nearly 30 percent of their temples have been closed for economic reasons, and the&nbsp;<br>number of devotees staffing the remaining&nbsp;temples has plummeted from&nbsp;a high of 5,000&nbsp;<br>to an estimated 800. The Krishnas are a resilient group, though. Officials admit that the&nbsp;<br>organization&nbsp;is struggling to maintain its&nbsp;long-standing presence in North America, but&nbsp;<br>they report that it is thriving in the newly opened &quot;markets&quot; of Eastern Europe—where,&nbsp;<br>apparently, people haven't yet caught on to&nbsp;the Krishnas'&nbsp;strategic benevolence.&nbsp;<br>
Although the Krishnas have moved on to &quot;greener&quot; pastures,&nbsp;we would be foolish to&nbsp;<br>think that&nbsp;they've taken all the effective reciprocation tactics with&nbsp;them. Survey&nbsp;<br>researchers have discovered that sending a monetary gift (a silver dollar or a $5 check)&nbsp;<br>in an envelope with a mailed questionnaire&nbsp;greatly increases survey completion rates,&nbsp;<br>compared to offering the same monetary amount as an after-the-fact reward (Church,&nbsp;<br>1993; Warriner, Goyder, Gjertsen, Horner, &amp; McSpurren, 1996). Indeed, one study&nbsp;<br>showed that mailing a $5 &quot;gift&quot; check along&nbsp;with an insurance survey was twice as&nbsp;<br>effective as offering a $50 payment for sending back a completed survey (James &amp;&nbsp;<br>Bolstein, 1992). Similarly, food servers have&nbsp;learned that simply giving customers a&nbsp;<br>candy or mint along with their bill significantly increases tips (Lynn &amp; McCall, 1998).&nbsp;<br>In general, business operators have found that, after accepting a gift, customers are&nbsp;<br>willing to purchase products and services they would have otherwise declined (Gruner,&nbsp;<br>1996).&nbsp;<br>

It appears that the give-and-take&nbsp;of&nbsp;social interaction is recognized well before&nbsp;<br>adulthood. One fifth-grade teacher&nbsp;wrote to me about a test she gives her students on the&nbsp;<br>proper use of the past, present, and future tenses. To the question, The future of &quot;I give&quot;&nbsp;<br>is_____?, one enterprising young man wrote,&nbsp;&quot;I take.&quot; He may have gotten that&nbsp;<br>particular grammatical rule&nbsp;wrong, but he got a larger societal rule precisely right.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Politics</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Politics is another arena in which the power&nbsp;of&nbsp;the reciprocity rule shows itself.&nbsp;<br>Reciprocation tactics appear at every level:&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;At the top,&nbsp;elected officials engage&nbsp;in&nbsp;&quot;logrolling&quot; and&nbsp;the exchange of favors that&nbsp;<br>makes politics the&nbsp;place of strange&nbsp;bedfellows, indeed. The out-of-character vote&nbsp;of one&nbsp;<br>of our elected representatives on a bill or measure can often be understood as a favor&nbsp;<br>returned to&nbsp;the bill's sponsor. Political analysts were amazed at Lyndon Johnson's&nbsp;<br>success in getting so many of his programs through Congress during his early&nbsp;<br>administration. Even members of Congress who were thought to be strongly opposed to&nbsp;<br>the proposals were voting for them. Close examination by political scientists has found&nbsp;<br>the cause to be not so much Johnson's political&nbsp;savvy as the large score of favors he had&nbsp;<br>been able to provide to other legislators during his many&nbsp;years of power in the House&nbsp;<br>and Senate. As president, he was able to produce a truly remarkable amount of&nbsp;<br>legislation in a short time&nbsp;by calling in those favors. It is interesting&nbsp;that this same&nbsp;<br>process may account for the problems Jimmy Carter had in getting&nbsp;his programs&nbsp;<br>through Congress during his early administration, despite heavy Democratic majorities&nbsp;<br>in both the House and Senate. Carter came to&nbsp;the presidency from&nbsp;outside the Capitol&nbsp;<br>Hill establishment. He campaigned on his outside-Washington identity, saying that he&nbsp;<br>was indebted to no one. Much of his legislative difficulty upon arriving may be traced&nbsp;<br>to the fact that no one there was indebted to&nbsp;<i>him.&nbsp;</i>Much the same may be said about the&nbsp;<br>first-term&nbsp;legislation record of&nbsp;Washington outsider Bill Clinton.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;At another level, we can see the recognized&nbsp;strength of the reciprocity rule in the&nbsp;<br>desire of corporations&nbsp;and individuals to provide judicial and legislative officials&nbsp;with&nbsp;<br>gifts and favors and in the series of legal restrictions against such gifts and favors. Even&nbsp;<br>with legitimate political contributions, the&nbsp;stockpiling of obligations often underlies the&nbsp;<br>stated purpose of supporting a favorite candidate. One look at the lists of companies and&nbsp;<br>organizations that contribute to the campaigns of&nbsp;<i>both&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>major candidates in important&nbsp;<br>elections&nbsp;gives evidence of such motives.&nbsp;A&nbsp;skeptic, requiring direct evidence of the&nbsp;<br><i>quid pro quo&nbsp;</i>expected by political contributors, might look&nbsp;to the remarkably bald-<br>faced admission by businessman Roger Tamraz at congressional hearings on campaign&nbsp;<br>finance reform. When asked if he felt he&nbsp;received a good return&nbsp;on his contribution of&nbsp;<br>$300,000, he smiled and replied, &quot;I think next time, I'll give $600,000.&quot;&nbsp;<br>

Honesty of this sort is rare&nbsp;in politics. For the&nbsp;most part, the givers and takers join&nbsp;<br>voices to dismiss the idea that campaign contributions, free trips, and Super Bowl&nbsp;<br>tickets would bias the opinions of &quot;sober,&nbsp;conscientious&quot; government&nbsp;officials. As the&nbsp;<br>head of one lobbying organization insisted, there is no cause for concern because&nbsp;<br>&quot;These [government officials] are smart,&nbsp;mature, sophisticated men and women at the&nbsp;<br>top of their professions, disposed by training to be discerning, critical, and alert&quot;&nbsp;<br>(Barker, 1998). And, of course, the politicians concur. Regularly, we hear them&nbsp;<br>proclaiming total independence from the feelings&nbsp;of obligation that influence everyone&nbsp;<br>else. One of my&nbsp;own state representatives&nbsp;left no room for&nbsp;doubt&nbsp;when describing his&nbsp;<br>accountability to gift-givers, &quot;It gets them&nbsp;exactly what it gets everybody else: nothing&quot;&nbsp;<br>(Foster, 1991).&nbsp;<br>
Excuse me if&nbsp;I, as a scientist, laugh. Sober, conscientious scientists know better. One&nbsp;<br>reason they know better is that these &quot;smart, mature, sophisticated men and women at&nbsp;<br>the top of their [scientific] professions&quot; have&nbsp;found themselves to be&nbsp;as susceptible as&nbsp;<br>anyone else to the process. Take the case of the medical controversy surrounding the&nbsp;<br>safety of calcium-channel blockers, a class of drugs for heart disease. One study&nbsp;<br>discovered that 100 percent of the scientists who found and published results supportive&nbsp;<br>of the drugs had received prior support (free trips, research&nbsp;funding, or employment)&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;the pharmaceutical companies; but only 37&nbsp;percent of those critical of the drugs&nbsp;<br>had received any such prior support&nbsp;(Stelfox, Chua, O'Rourke, &amp; Detsky, 1998). If&nbsp;<br>scientists, &quot;disposed by&nbsp;training to be discerning, critical,&nbsp;and alert,&quot; can be swayed by&nbsp;<br>the insistent undertow of&nbsp;exchange, we should&nbsp;fully expect that politicians will be, too.&nbsp;<br>Elected and appointed officials&nbsp;often see themselves as immune to the rules that apply&nbsp;<br>to rest of us—parking regulations&nbsp;and the like. But, to indulge them&nbsp;in this conceit when&nbsp;<br>it comes to the rule of&nbsp;reciprocity is&nbsp;not only laughable, it's&nbsp;dangerous.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>The Not-So-Free Sample</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Of course, the power of reciprocity can be&nbsp;found in the merchandising field as well.&nbsp;<br>Although the number of examples is large, let's examine a pair of familiar ones. As a&nbsp;<br>marketing technique, the free sample has a long and effective history.&nbsp;In&nbsp;most instances,&nbsp;<br>a small amount of the relevant&nbsp;product is given to potential&nbsp;customers to see if&nbsp;they&nbsp;like&nbsp;<br>it. Certainly&nbsp;this is a legitimate desire of the manufacturer—to expose the public to the&nbsp;<br>qualities of the product. The beauty of the free sample, however,&nbsp;is that it is also a gift&nbsp;<br>and, as such, can engage the reciprocity rule. In true jujitsu fashion, a promoter who&nbsp;<br>provides free samples can release the natural in-debting force inherent in a gift, while&nbsp;<br>innocently appearing to have&nbsp;only the intention to inform.&nbsp;<br>
A favorite place for free samples is the supermarket, where customers are frequently&nbsp;<br>given small amounts of a certain product to&nbsp;try. Many people find it difficult to accept&nbsp;<br>samples from&nbsp;the always smiling attendant, return only the toothpicks or cups, and walk&nbsp;<br>away. Instead, they buy some&nbsp;of the product, even if they might not have liked it very&nbsp;<br>much. A highly effective variation on this marketing procedure is&nbsp;<br>

illustrated in&nbsp;the case, cited by Vance Packard in&nbsp;<i>The Hidden Persuaders&nbsp;</i>(1957), of the&nbsp;<br>Indiana supermarket operator who sold an&nbsp;astounding 1,000 pounds&nbsp;of cheese in a few&nbsp;<br>hours one day by putting&nbsp;out the cheese and inviting customers to cut off slivers for&nbsp;<br>themselves as free samples.&nbsp;<br>
A different version of the free-sample tactic&nbsp;is used by the Amway Corporation, a rapid-<br>growth company that manufacturers and distributes household and personal-&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

care products in a vast national network of door-to-door&nbsp;neighborhood sales. The&nbsp;<br>company, which has grown from&nbsp;a basement-run operation to a $1.5 billion yearly sales&nbsp;<br>business, makes use of the free sample in a device called the BUG. The BUG consists&nbsp;<br>of a collection of Amway products—bottles of furniture polish, detergent, or shampoo,&nbsp;<br>spray containers of deodorizers, insect killers, or window cleaners— carried to a&nbsp;<br>customer's home&nbsp;in a specially designed&nbsp;tray or just a polyethylene bag. The&nbsp;<br>confidential Amway Career Manual then instructs the salesperson to&nbsp;leave the&nbsp;BUG&nbsp;<br>with the customer &quot;for 24,48, or 72 hours, at no&nbsp;cost or obligation to&nbsp;her. Just tell her&nbsp;<br>you would like her to try the products.... That's an offer no one can refuse.&quot; At the end&nbsp;<br>of the trial period, the&nbsp;Amway representative is to return and pick up orders for the&nbsp;<br>products the customer wishes to purchase. Since few customers use up the entire&nbsp;<br>contents of even one of the product containers&nbsp;in such a short time, the salesperson may&nbsp;<br>then take the remaining product portions in&nbsp;the BUG to the next potential customer&nbsp;<br>down the line or across the street and start the process again. Many Amway&nbsp;<br>representatives have several BUGS circulating in their districts at one time. Of course,&nbsp;<br>by now you and I know that the customer who has accepted and used the BUG products&nbsp;<br>has been trapped by the reciprocity rule. Many such customers yield&nbsp;to a sense of&nbsp;<br>obligation to order the products that they&nbsp;have tried and partially consumed—and, of&nbsp;<br>course, by now the Amway Corporation knows that to be the case. Even in a company&nbsp;<br>with as excellent&nbsp;a growth record as Amway, the BUG device has created a big stir.&nbsp;<br>Reports by state distributors to the parent company record a remarkable effect:&nbsp;<br>
<i>Unbelievable! We've never seen such excitement. Product is moving at an unbelievable&nbsp;<br>rate, and we've only just begun. . .. Local distributors took the BUGS, and we've had an&nbsp;<br>unbelievable increase in sales [from Illinois distributor].&nbsp;The&nbsp;most fantastic retail idea&nbsp;<br>we've ever had!. . . On the average, customers purchased about half the total amount of&nbsp;<br>the BUG when it is picked up.... In one word, tremendous! We've never seen a response&nbsp;<br>within our entire organization like this [from Massachusetts distributor].</i>&nbsp;<br>
The Amway distributors appear to be&nbsp;bewildered—happily so, but nonetheless&nbsp;<br>bewildered—by the startling power of the BUG. Of course, by now you and I should&nbsp;<br>not be.&nbsp;<br>
The reciprocity rule governs many situations&nbsp;of&nbsp;a purely&nbsp;interpersonal nature where&nbsp;<br>neither&nbsp;money nor commercial exchange is at&nbsp;issue. Perhaps my&nbsp;favorite illustration&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>the enormous force available from&nbsp;the reciprocation weapon of influence comes from&nbsp;<br>such a situation. The European scientist Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1975) provides the account of a&nbsp;<br>German soldier during&nbsp;World War I whose&nbsp;job was to capture&nbsp;enemy soldiers&nbsp;for&nbsp;<br>interrogation. Because of&nbsp;the nature of the trench warfare&nbsp;at that time, it was extremely&nbsp;<br>difficult for armies to cross the no-man's-land between opposing front lines, but it was&nbsp;<br>not so difficult for a single soldier&nbsp;to crawl across&nbsp;and slip into an&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=40></a>30&nbsp;<i>Chapter 2</i>&nbsp;<br>
enemy trench position. The armies of the Great War had experts who regularly did so to&nbsp;<br>capture enemy soldiers, who would then be brought back for questioning. The German&nbsp;<br>expert had often successfully completed&nbsp;such&nbsp;missions in&nbsp;the past and was sent on&nbsp;<br>another. Once again, he skillfully negotiated the area between fronts&nbsp;and surprised&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>lone enemy soldier in his trench. The unsuspecting soldier, who had been eating at the&nbsp;<br>time, was easily disarmed. The frightened&nbsp;captive, with only a piece of bread in his&nbsp;<br>hand, then performed what may have been the&nbsp;most important act of his life. He gave&nbsp;<br>his enemy some&nbsp;of the bread. So affected was&nbsp;the German by this gift that he could not&nbsp;<br>complete his mission. He turned from&nbsp;his benefactor and recrossed the no-man's-land&nbsp;<br>empty-handed to face the wrath of his superiors.&nbsp;<br>
An equally compelling point regarding the power&nbsp;<b>of&nbsp;</b>reciprocity comes from an account&nbsp;<br>of a woman who saved her own life, not by&nbsp;<i>giving a&nbsp;</i>gift&nbsp;as did the captured soldier, but&nbsp;<br>by&nbsp;<i>refusing a&nbsp;</i>gift and the powerful obligations that&nbsp;went with it. In November 1978 Jim&nbsp;<br>Jones the leader of Jonestown,&nbsp;Guyana, called for the mass suicide of all residents, most&nbsp;<br>of whom compliantly drank and died from a&nbsp;vat of poison-laced Kool-Aid. Diane Louie,&nbsp;<br>a resident, however, rejected Jones's command and made her way out of Jonestown and&nbsp;<br>into the jungle. She attributes&nbsp;her&nbsp;willingness to do so&nbsp;to her earlier&nbsp;refusal to&nbsp;accept&nbsp;<br>special favors from&nbsp;him when she was in need. She turned&nbsp;down his offer of special&nbsp;<br>food while she was ill, because &quot;I knew once he gave me&nbsp;those privileges, he'd&nbsp;have me.&nbsp;<br>I didn't want to owe him&nbsp;nothin'&nbsp;&quot; (Anderson &amp; Zimbardo, 1984).&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>The Rule Enforces Uninvited Debts</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Earlier we suggested that the power of the reciprocity rule is&nbsp;such that, by first doing us&nbsp;<br>a favor, strange, disliked, or unwelcome&nbsp;others&nbsp;can enhance the chance that we will&nbsp;<br>comply with one of their requests. However,&nbsp;there is another aspect&nbsp;of&nbsp;the rule,&nbsp;in&nbsp;<br>addition to its power, that allows this&nbsp;phenomenon to occur. A person can trigger a&nbsp;<br>feeling of indebtedness by doing us an&nbsp;uninvited favor (Paese &amp; Gilin, 2000). Recall&nbsp;<br>that the rule states only that we should provide to others the kind&nbsp;of actions they have&nbsp;<br>provided us; it does not require us to&nbsp;have asked for what we have received in order to&nbsp;<br>feel obligated to&nbsp;repay.&nbsp;For instance, the&nbsp;American Disabled Veterans organization&nbsp;<br>reports that its simple mail appeal for donations produces a response rate of about 18&nbsp;<br>percent. But when the mailing also includes&nbsp;an unsolicited gift (gummed, individualized&nbsp;<br>address labels), the success rate nearly doubles to 35 percent. This is not to say that we&nbsp;<br>might not feel a stronger sense of obligation to return a favor we have requested, but&nbsp;<br>such a request is not necessary to&nbsp;produce our feeling of indebtedness.&nbsp;<br>
If we reflect for a moment about the social&nbsp;purpose of the reciprocity rule, we can see&nbsp;<br>why this is the case.&nbsp;The&nbsp;rule&nbsp;was established to promote the development of reciprocal&nbsp;<br>relationships between individuals so that one person could&nbsp;<i>initiate&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>such a relationship&nbsp;<br>without the fear of loss. If the rule&nbsp;is to serve that purpose, then an un&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

invited first favor must&nbsp;have the ability&nbsp;to create an obligation. Recall, also, that&nbsp;<br>reciprocal relationships confer an extraordinary advantage upon cultures that foster&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;and that, consequently, there will be strong pressures&nbsp;to ensure that the rule does&nbsp;<br>serve its purpose. Little wonder, then, that influential French anthropologist Marcel&nbsp;<br>Mauss (1954), in describing the social pressures surrounding the gift-giving process in&nbsp;<br>human culture, says that&nbsp;there is an obligation to give, an obligation to receive, and an&nbsp;<br>obligation to repay.&nbsp;<br>
Although an&nbsp;obligation to repay constitutes the&nbsp;essence of the reciprocity rule, it is the&nbsp;<br>obligation to receive that makes the rule so&nbsp;easy to exploit. An obligation to receive&nbsp;<br>reduces our ability to choose those to whom&nbsp;we wish to be indebted and puts the power&nbsp;<br>in the hands&nbsp;of others. Let's reexamine a pair of earlier examples to see how the process&nbsp;<br>works. First, in the Regan&nbsp;study, we find that the favor&nbsp;causing subjects to double the&nbsp;<br>number of raffle tickets&nbsp;purchased from&nbsp;Joe was not one they had requested. Joe had&nbsp;<br>voluntarily left the room&nbsp;and returned with one Coke for himself and one for the&nbsp;<br>subject. There was not a single subject who refused the Coke. It is easy to see why it&nbsp;<br>would have been awkward to turn down Joe's&nbsp;favor: Joe had already spent his money;&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>soft drink was an appropriate favor in the situation, especially&nbsp;since Joe had one&nbsp;<br>himself;&nbsp;it would have been considered impolite to reject Joe's thoughtful action.&nbsp;<br>Nevertheless, receipt of that&nbsp;Coke produced a feeling of&nbsp;indebtedness that became clear&nbsp;<br>when Joe announced his desire to sell some&nbsp;raffle tickets. Notice the important&nbsp;<br>asymmetry here—all the&nbsp;genuinely free choices were Joe's. He chose the form&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<br>initial favor, and he chose the form&nbsp;of the return favor. Of course,&nbsp;one could say that the&nbsp;<br>subject had the choice of refusing both of Joe's offers, but those would have been tough&nbsp;<br>choices.&nbsp;To have said no at either point&nbsp;would have required the&nbsp;subject to go against&nbsp;<br>the natural cultural forces&nbsp;favoring reciprocation.&nbsp;<br>
The extent to which even an unwanted favor, once received, can produce indebtedness&nbsp;<br>is aptly&nbsp;illustrated in the soliciting technique of the Hare Krishna Society. During&nbsp;<br>systematic observation of the Krishnas'&nbsp;soliciting strategy, I recorded a variety of&nbsp;<br>responses from&nbsp;target persons. One of the most regular was as follows:&nbsp;<br>
<i>An airport visitor</i>—<i>a businessman</i>—<i>is hurriedly walking along through a densely&nbsp;<br>peopled area. The Krishna solicitor steps in&nbsp;front of him and hands&nbsp;him a flower. The&nbsp;<br>man, reacting with surprise, takes it.2&nbsp;Almost immediately,</i>&nbsp;<br>
2Surprise is an effective compliance producer&nbsp;in its own right. People who are surprised&nbsp;<br>by a request&nbsp;will often comply because they are momentarily&nbsp;unsure of&nbsp;themselves and,&nbsp;<br>consequently, influenced easily. For example,&nbsp;social psychologists Stanley Milgram&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br>John Sabini (1975) have shown that people riding on the New York subway were twice&nbsp;<br>as likely to give up their seats to a person&nbsp;who surprised them with the request, &quot;Excuse&nbsp;<br>me. May I have your seat?&quot;&nbsp;than to one who forewarned them first by mentioning to a&nbsp;<br>fellow passenger that he or she was thinking of asking for someone's seat (56 versus 28&nbsp;<br>percent).&nbsp;<br>

<i>he tries to give it back, saying he does&nbsp;not want the flower. The Krishna member&nbsp;<br>responds that it is a gift from the Krishna Society and that it is the man's to keep . . .&nbsp;<br>however, a donation to further the Society's&nbsp;good works would be appreciated. Again&nbsp;<br>the target protests, &quot;I don't want this flower. Here, take it.&quot; And again the solicitor&nbsp;<br>refuses, &quot;It's&nbsp;our gift to you, sir.&quot; There&nbsp;is visible conflict on the businessman's face.&nbsp;<br>Should he keep the flower and walk away without giving anything in return, or should&nbsp;<br>he yield to the pressure&nbsp;of the deeply ingrained reciprocity rule&nbsp;and provide&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>contribution? By now, the conflict has spread from his face to his posture. He leans&nbsp;<br>away from his benefactor, seemingly about to&nbsp;break free, only to be drawn back again&nbsp;<br>by the pull of the rule. Once more&nbsp;his body tilts away, but it's no use; he cannot&nbsp;<br>disengage. With&nbsp;a nod of resignation, he fishes&nbsp;in his pocket and comes up with a dollar&nbsp;<br>or two that is graciously accepted. Now he can walk away freely, and he&nbsp;does, &quot;gift&quot; in&nbsp;<br>hand, until he&nbsp;encounters&nbsp;a waste container</i>—<i>where he throws the flower, with force.</i>&nbsp;<br>
Purely by accident, I happened to witness a scene that demonstrates that the Krishnas&nbsp;<br>know very well how frequently their gifts are unwanted by the people who receive&nbsp;<br>them. While spending a day observing a soliciting Krishna group at Chicago's O'Hare&nbsp;<br>International Airport a few years ago, I noticed that one of the group members would&nbsp;<br>frequently&nbsp;leave the central&nbsp;area&nbsp;and return&nbsp;with more&nbsp;flowers to resup-ply her&nbsp;<br>companions. As it happened, I had decided to&nbsp;take a break just as&nbsp;she was leaving on&nbsp;<br>one of her supply missions. Having nowhere&nbsp;to go, I followed her.&nbsp;Her journey turned&nbsp;<br>out to be a garbage route. She went from&nbsp;trash can to trash can beyond the immediate&nbsp;<br>area to retrieve all the flowers that had been discarded by&nbsp;Krishna targets. She then&nbsp;<br>returned with the cache of recovered&nbsp;flowers (some that had been recycled&nbsp;who knows&nbsp;<br>how many times) and distributed them to be&nbsp;profitably cycled through the reciprocation&nbsp;<br>process once more. What really impressed me&nbsp;about all this was that most of the&nbsp;<br>discarded flowers had brought donations from&nbsp;the people who had cast them&nbsp;away. The&nbsp;<br>nature of the reciprocity&nbsp;rule is such&nbsp;that a gift so&nbsp;unwanted that it was thrown away at&nbsp;<br>the first opportunity had nonetheless been effective and exploitable.&nbsp;<br>
The ability&nbsp;of&nbsp;uninvited&nbsp;gifts to produce feelings of&nbsp;obligation is recognized by&nbsp;a variety&nbsp;<br>of organizations besides&nbsp;the Krishnas. How&nbsp;many times has each of us received&nbsp;small&nbsp;<br>gifts through the mail—personalized address labels, greeting cards, key rings—from&nbsp;<br>charitable agencies that ask for funds in an&nbsp;accompanying note?&nbsp;I have received five in&nbsp;<br>just the past year, two from&nbsp;disabled veterans'&nbsp;groups and the others from&nbsp;missionary&nbsp;<br>schools and&nbsp;hospitals.&nbsp;In each case,&nbsp;there&nbsp;was a common thread in the accompanying&nbsp;<br>message. The goods that were enclosed were&nbsp;to be considered a gift from the&nbsp;<br>organization; and money I wished to send should not be regarded as payment but rather&nbsp;<br>as a return offering. As the letter from&nbsp;one&nbsp;of the missionary programs stated, the packet&nbsp;<br>of greeting cards I had been sent was not to be directly paid for&nbsp;<br>

but was designed &quot;to encourage your [my]&nbsp;kindness.&quot; If we look past the obvious tax&nbsp;<br>advantage,&nbsp;we can see why it would be beneficial for the organization to have the cards&nbsp;<br>viewed as a gift instead of&nbsp;merchandise: There is a strong cultural pressure to&nbsp;<br>reciprocate a gift, even&nbsp;an&nbsp;unwanted one; but there is no such pressure to purchase an&nbsp;<br><i>unwanted&nbsp;</i>commercial product.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>The Rule Can Trigger Unequal Exchanges</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
There is yet another feature of the reciprocity rule that&nbsp;allows it to be exploited for&nbsp;<br>profit. Paradoxically, although the rule developed to promote equal exchanges between&nbsp;<br>partners, it can be used to bring about decidedly unequal results. The rule demands that&nbsp;<br>one sort of action be reciprocated with a similar sort of&nbsp;action.&nbsp;A favor is to be met with&nbsp;<br>another&nbsp;favor; it is not to be met with neglect and certainly&nbsp;not with&nbsp;attack; however,&nbsp;<br>considerable&nbsp;flexibility is allowed. A small initial favor can produce a sense of&nbsp;<br>obligation to&nbsp;agree to&nbsp;a substantially larger&nbsp;return favor. Since, as&nbsp;we have already seen,&nbsp;<br>the rule allows one person to choose the nature of the indebting first favor&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>the&nbsp;<br>nature of the debt-canceling return favor, we&nbsp;could easily be manipulated into&nbsp;an unfair&nbsp;<br>exchange by those who might wish to exploit the rule.&nbsp;<br>
Once again, we turn to the Regan experiment&nbsp;for evidence. Remember in that study, Joe&nbsp;<br>gave one group of subjects a bottle of Coca-Cola&nbsp;as an initiating gift&nbsp;and later asked all&nbsp;<br>subjects to buy some&nbsp;of his raffle tickets at&nbsp;25 cents apiece. What I have so far neglected&nbsp;<br>to mention is that the study was done in the late 1960s, when the price of a Coke was a&nbsp;<br>dime. On the average, subjects who had been&nbsp;given a 10-cent drink bought two of Joe's&nbsp;<br>raffle tickets, although some&nbsp;bought as many as&nbsp;seven. Even if we look just at the&nbsp;<br>average, though, we can tell that Joe made&nbsp;quite a deal. A 500 percent return on&nbsp;<br>investment is respectable indeed!&nbsp;<br>
In Joe's case, though, even a 500 percent return amounted to only 50 cents. Can the&nbsp;<br>reciprocity rule produce meaningfully large&nbsp;differences in the sizes of the exchanged&nbsp;<br>favors? Under the right circumstances, it certainly can. Take, for instance, the account&nbsp;<br>of a student of mine concerning a day she remembers ruefully.&nbsp;<br>
<i>About one year ago, I couldn't start my car. As&nbsp;I was sitting there,&nbsp;a guy in the parking&nbsp;<br>lot came over and eventually jump-started the car. I said thanks, and he said you 're&nbsp;<br>welcome; as he was leaving, I&nbsp;said that if he ever&nbsp;needed a favor to stop by. About a&nbsp;<br>month later,&nbsp;the guy knocked on my door and asked to borrow my car for two hours as&nbsp;<br>his was in the shop. I felt somewhat obligated&nbsp;but uncertain, since&nbsp;the car was pretty&nbsp;<br>new and he looked very young. Later, I found out that he was underage and had no&nbsp;<br>insurance. Anyway, I lent&nbsp;him the car.&nbsp;He totaled it.</i>&nbsp;<br>
How could it happen that an intelligent&nbsp;young woman would agree to&nbsp;turn over her new&nbsp;<br>car to a virtual stranger (and a youngster&nbsp;at that) because he had done her a&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

small favor a month earlier? Or, more generally, why should it be that&nbsp;small first favors&nbsp;<br>often stimulate&nbsp;larger return&nbsp;favors?&nbsp;One important reason concerns the clearly&nbsp;<br>unpleasant character of the&nbsp;feeling of indebtedness.&nbsp;Most of us find it highly&nbsp;<br>disagreeable to be in a state of obligation.&nbsp;It weighs heavily on us and demands to be&nbsp;<br>removed. It is not difficult to trace the source of this feeling. Because reciprocal&nbsp;<br>arrangements are so vital in human social&nbsp;systems, we have been conditioned to feel&nbsp;<br>uncomfortable when beholden. If we were to ignore the need&nbsp;to return another's initial&nbsp;<br>favor, we would stop one reciprocal sequence dead and make it less likely that&nbsp;our&nbsp;<br>benefactor would do such favors&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;future.&nbsp;Neither&nbsp;event is in&nbsp;the best interests of&nbsp;<br>society. Consequently, we are trained from&nbsp;childhood to chafe, emotionally, under the&nbsp;<br>saddle of obligation. For this reason alone, then, we may be willing to agree to perform&nbsp;<br>a larger favor than the one we received, merely to relieve ourselves of the psychological&nbsp;<br>burden of debt.&nbsp;<br>
There is another reason as well. A person who violates the reciprocity rule by accepting&nbsp;<br>without attempting to return&nbsp;the good acts of others is disliked by the social group. The&nbsp;<br>exception, of course, occurs when a person is prevented from repayment by reasons of&nbsp;<br>circumstance or ability.&nbsp;For the most part,&nbsp;however, there is a genuine&nbsp;distaste&nbsp;for an&nbsp;<br>individual who fails to&nbsp;conform&nbsp;to the dictates of the reciprocity rule.3&nbsp;Moocher and&nbsp;<br>ingrate are unsavory labels&nbsp;to be scrupulously shunned. So&nbsp;undesirable are they that&nbsp;<br>people will sometimes agree to an unequal exchange in order to dodge them.&nbsp;<br>
In combination, the reality of internal discomfort and the possibility of external shame&nbsp;<br>can produce a heavy psychological cost. When seen&nbsp;in the light of this cost, it is not so&nbsp;<br>puzzling&nbsp;that, in&nbsp;the&nbsp;name of&nbsp;reciprocity,&nbsp;we will often give back&nbsp;more than we&nbsp;have&nbsp;<br>received. Neither is it so odd that we will&nbsp;often avoid asking for a needed favor if&nbsp;we&nbsp;<br>will not be in a position to repay it (De&nbsp;Paulo,&nbsp;Nadler, &amp; Fisher, 1983; Greenberg&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<br>Shapiro, 1971; Riley &amp; Eckenrode, 1986). The&nbsp;psychological cost may simply outweigh&nbsp;<br>the material&nbsp;loss.&nbsp;<br>
The risk of still other kinds&nbsp;of losses may also persuade people to decline certain gifts&nbsp;<br>and benefits. Women frequently comment&nbsp;on the uncomfortable sense of obligation&nbsp;<br>they can feel&nbsp;to return the favors of&nbsp;a&nbsp;man&nbsp;who has given them&nbsp;an expensive present or&nbsp;<br>paid for a costly evening out. Even something as small as the price of&nbsp;a drink can&nbsp;<br>produce a feeling of debt. A student in one of&nbsp;my classes expressed it quite plainly in a&nbsp;<br>paper she wrote: &quot;After learning the hard&nbsp;way, I no longer let a guy I meet&nbsp;in a club buy&nbsp;<br>me&nbsp;a drink because I don't want either of us&nbsp;to feel that I am&nbsp;obligated sexually.&quot;&nbsp;<br>Research suggests that there is a basis for her concern. If, in-&nbsp;<br>
3Interestingly enough, a cross-cultural study has shown that those who break the&nbsp;<br>reciprocity rule in the reverse direction—by giving without allowing the recipient an&nbsp;<br>opportunity to repay—are also disliked for it. This result was found to hold for each of&nbsp;<br>the three nationalities&nbsp;investigated—Americans, Swedes, and Japanese (Gergen,&nbsp;<br>Ellsworth, Maslach, &amp; Seipel, 1975).&nbsp;<br>

stead of paying for them herself, a woman allows a man to buy her drinks, she is&nbsp;<br>immediately judged (by both&nbsp;men and women) as more&nbsp;sexually available to him&nbsp;<br>(George, Gournic, &amp; McAfee, 1988).&nbsp;<br>
The rule for reciprocity applies to most relationships; however, in its purest form&nbsp;<br>reciprocity is unnecessary and&nbsp;undesirable in certain long-term&nbsp;relationships such as&nbsp;<br>families or established friendships. In these &quot;communal&quot; relationships (Clark &amp; Mills,&nbsp;<br>1979; Mills &amp; Clark, 1982), what is exchanged reciprocally is the willingness to provide&nbsp;<br>what the other needs, when&nbsp;it is needed (Clark, Mills,&nbsp;&amp; Corcoran, 1989). Under this&nbsp;<br>form&nbsp;of reciprocity, it is&nbsp;not necessary to calculate who has given more or less but only&nbsp;<br>whether both parties are living up to the&nbsp;more general rule (Clark, 1984; Clark &amp;&nbsp;<br>Waddell, 1985; Clark, Mills, &amp; Powell, 1986).&nbsp;Still,&nbsp;it appears that persistent&nbsp;inequities&nbsp;<br>can lead to dissatisfactions, even in friendships.&nbsp;<br>

<b>READER'S&nbsp;REPORT 2.1</b>&nbsp;<br>
<b>From a State of Oregon Employee</b>&nbsp;<br>
The person who used to have my&nbsp;job told&nbsp;me&nbsp;during my&nbsp;training that I would like&nbsp;<br>working for my&nbsp;boss because he is a very&nbsp;nice and generous person. She said that he&nbsp;<br>always gave her flowers and other gifts&nbsp;on different occasions. She decided to stop&nbsp;<br>working because she was going to have a child and wanted to stay&nbsp;home; otherwise I&nbsp;<br>am&nbsp;sure she would have stayed on&nbsp;at this job for many more years.&nbsp;<br>
I have been working for this same&nbsp;boss for six years now, and I&nbsp;have&nbsp;experienced&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>same&nbsp;thing. He gives me and my&nbsp;son gifts&nbsp;for Christmas and gives me presents on my&nbsp;<br>birthday. It has been over two years&nbsp;since I have reached the top of&nbsp;my classification for&nbsp;<br>a salary increase. There is no promotion for the type of job I have and my&nbsp;only choice is&nbsp;<br>to take a test with the state system&nbsp;and reapply to move to another department or maybe&nbsp;<br>find another job in a private company. But I find myself resisting trying to find another&nbsp;<br>job or move to another department. My boss&nbsp;is reaching&nbsp;retirement age and I am&nbsp;<br>thinking&nbsp;maybe I will be able to move out&nbsp;after he retires because for now I feel&nbsp;<br>obligated to stay since he has been so nice to me.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Author's note:&nbsp;</b>I am struck by this&nbsp;reader's language in describing her current&nbsp;<br>employment options, saying that she &quot;will be&nbsp;able&quot;&nbsp;to move to another job only after her&nbsp;<br>boss retires. It seems that his small kindnesses have nurtured a binding sense of&nbsp;<br>obligation that has made her&nbsp;</i>unable&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>to seek a better paying&nbsp;position. There is an&nbsp;<br>obvious lesson here for managers wishing to instill loyalty in employees. But there is a&nbsp;<br>larger lesson for all of us, as well:&nbsp;Little things are not always little</i>—<i>not when they link&nbsp;<br>to the&nbsp;</i>big&nbsp;<i>rules of life, like reciprocity.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<b>RECIPROCAL CONCESSIONS</b>&nbsp;<br>
There is a second way to employ the reciprocity&nbsp;rule to get someone to comply with a&nbsp;<br>request.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;more subtle&nbsp;than the direct&nbsp;route of providing that&nbsp;person with a favor and&nbsp;<br>then asking for one in return, yet in some&nbsp;ways it is much more effective. A personal&nbsp;<br>experience I had a few years ago gave me&nbsp;firsthand evidence of just how well this&nbsp;<br>compliance technique works.&nbsp;<br>
I was walking down the street when I was approached by an 11-&nbsp;or 12-year-old boy. He&nbsp;<br>introduced himself and said he was selling tickets to the annual Boy Scouts Circus to be&nbsp;<br>held on the upcoming Saturday night. He asked if I wished to buy any tickets at $5&nbsp;<br>apiece. Since one of the last places I wanted&nbsp;to spend Saturday evening&nbsp;was with the&nbsp;<br>Boy Scouts, I declined. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, if you don't want&nbsp;to buy any tickets, how about&nbsp;<br>buying some of our chocolate bars?&nbsp;They're only $1 each.&quot; I bought a couple and, right&nbsp;<br>away, realized that&nbsp;something noteworthy&nbsp;had happened. I knew that to be the case&nbsp;<br>because (a) I do not like chocolate bars; (b) I do like dol-&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=47></a><i>Reciprocation&nbsp;</i>37&nbsp;<br>
ars; (c) I was standing there&nbsp;with two of his chocolate bars; and (d) he was walking&nbsp;<br>away with two of my dollars.&nbsp;<br>
To try to understand precisely what had happened, I went to my&nbsp;office and called a&nbsp;<br>meeting of my research assistants. In discussing the situation, we began to see how the&nbsp;<br>reciprocity rule was implicated in my compliance with the request to buy the candy&nbsp;<br>bars. The general rule says that a person who acts in a certain&nbsp;way toward us is entitled&nbsp;<br>to a&nbsp;similar return&nbsp;action. We have already seen that one consequence&nbsp;of&nbsp;the rule is an&nbsp;<br>obligation to&nbsp;repay favors we have received. Another consequence of the rule, however,&nbsp;<br>is an obligation to make a concession&nbsp;to&nbsp;someone who has made a concession to us. As&nbsp;<br>my research&nbsp;group thought about it,&nbsp;we realized&nbsp;that was exactly&nbsp;the position&nbsp;the Boy&nbsp;<br>Scout had put me in. His request that I purchase some&nbsp;$1 chocolate bars had been put in&nbsp;<br>the form&nbsp;of a concession on his part; it&nbsp;was presented as a retreat from&nbsp;his request that I&nbsp;<br>buy some $5 tickets. If I were to live up to the dictates of the reciprocation rule, there&nbsp;<br>had to be a concession on my&nbsp;part.&nbsp;As we have seen,&nbsp;there was such a concession: I&nbsp;<br>changed from noncompliant to compliant when he moved from&nbsp;a larger to a smaller&nbsp;<br>request, even though I was not&nbsp;really interested in&nbsp;<i>either&nbsp;</i>of the things he offered.&nbsp;<br>
It was a classic example of the way a weapon of influence can infuse a compliance&nbsp;<br>request with its power. I had been moved to buy something, not because of any&nbsp;<br>favorable feelings toward the item,&nbsp;but because the purchase request had been presented&nbsp;<br>in a way that drew force from&nbsp;the reciprocity&nbsp;rule. It had not mattered that I do not like&nbsp;<br>chocolate bars; the Boy Scout had made a concession to me,&nbsp;<i>click,&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>whirr,&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>I&nbsp;<br>responded with a concession of my own. Of course, the tendency to reciprocate with a&nbsp;<br>concession is not so strong that it will work&nbsp;in all instances on&nbsp;all people; none of the&nbsp;<br>weapons of influence considered in this book&nbsp;is that strong. However, in my exchange&nbsp;<br>with the Boy Scout, the tendency had been sufficiently powerful to leave me&nbsp;in&nbsp;<br>mystified possession of a pair of&nbsp;unwanted and overpriced candy bars.&nbsp;<br>
Why should I feel obliged to&nbsp;reciprocate a concession? The&nbsp;answer rests once again in&nbsp;<br>the benefit of such a tendency to the society.&nbsp;It is in the interest&nbsp;of any human group to&nbsp;<br>have its members working together toward the achievement of common goals.&nbsp;<br>However, in many social interactions the&nbsp;participants begin with requirements and&nbsp;<br>demands that are unacceptable to one another.&nbsp;Thus, the society must arrange to have&nbsp;<br>these initial, incompatible desires&nbsp;set aside for the sake of socially beneficial&nbsp;<br>cooperation. This is accomplished through&nbsp;procedures that promote compromise.&nbsp;<br>Mutual concession is one important such procedure.&nbsp;<br>
The reciprocation rule brings&nbsp;about mutual concession in two ways. The first is obvious;&nbsp;<br>it pressures the recipient of&nbsp;an already-made concession to&nbsp;respond in kind. The second,&nbsp;<br>while not so obvious, is pivotally&nbsp;important. Because of a recipient's obligation&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>reciprocate, people are freed to make the&nbsp;<i>initial&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>concession and, thereby, to begin the&nbsp;<br>beneficial process of exchange. After all,&nbsp;if&nbsp;there were no social&nbsp;obligation&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>reciprocate a concession, who would want to&nbsp;make the first sacrifice? To do so would&nbsp;<br>be to risk giving up something and getting nothing back. However, with&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=48></a><i>Reciprocation&nbsp;</i>38&nbsp;<br>
the rule in effect, we can feel safe making&nbsp;the&nbsp;first sacrifice to our partner, who is&nbsp;<br>obligated to offer a return sacrifice.&nbsp;<br>
<b>REJECTION-THEN-RETREAT_______________________________</b>&nbsp;<br>
Because the rule for reciprocation governs the&nbsp;compromise process, it is possible to use&nbsp;<br>an initial concession as part of a highly&nbsp;effective&nbsp;compliance&nbsp;technique. The technique&nbsp;<br>is a simple one that we will call the rejection-then-retreat technique, although it is also&nbsp;<br>known as the door-in-the-face technique. Suppose you want me&nbsp;to agree to a certain&nbsp;<br>request.&nbsp;One way to increase the chances that&nbsp;I will comply is&nbsp;first to&nbsp;make a larger&nbsp;<br>request of me, one that I will most&nbsp;likely&nbsp;turn down. Then, after I have refused, you&nbsp;<br>make the smaller request that&nbsp;you were really interested&nbsp;in all along. Provided that you&nbsp;<br>structured your requests&nbsp;skillfully, I should view&nbsp;your second&nbsp;request as a concession&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>me&nbsp;and should feel inclined&nbsp;to respond with a&nbsp;concession of my&nbsp;own—compliance with&nbsp;<br>your second request.&nbsp;<br>
Was that the way the Boy Scout got me&nbsp;to&nbsp;buy his candy bars? Was his retreat from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>$5 request to the $1 request an artificial&nbsp;one that was intentionally designed to sell&nbsp;<br>candy bars? As one who has still refused to&nbsp;discard even his first Scout merit badge, I&nbsp;<br>genuinely hope not. Whether or not the large-request-then-small-request sequence was&nbsp;<br>planned, its effect was the same. It worked! Because it works, the rejection-then-retreat&nbsp;<br>technique can and will be&nbsp;<i>used purposely&nbsp;</i>by certain people to get their way. First let's&nbsp;<br>examine how this tactic can be used&nbsp;as a&nbsp;reliable compliance device.&nbsp;Later we&nbsp;will see&nbsp;<br>how it is already being used. Finally we can turn to a pair of&nbsp;little-known features of the&nbsp;<br>technique that make it one of the most&nbsp;influential compliance tactics available.&nbsp;<br>
Remember that after my encounter with the Boy&nbsp;Scout, I called my research assistants&nbsp;<br>together to try to understand what had happened to me—and, as it turned out, to eat the&nbsp;<br>evidence. Actually, we did more than that. We&nbsp;designed an experiment to test the&nbsp;<br>effectiveness of the procedure&nbsp;of moving to a desired request&nbsp;after a&nbsp;larger preliminary&nbsp;<br>request had been refused. We&nbsp;had two purposes&nbsp;in conducting the experiment. First, we&nbsp;<br>wanted to see whether this procedure worked&nbsp;on people besides me.&nbsp;(It certainly seemed&nbsp;<br>that the tactic had been effective on me&nbsp;earlier in the day, but then I have a history of&nbsp;<br>falling for compliance tricks of&nbsp;all sorts.)&nbsp;So&nbsp;the question remained, &quot;Does the rejection-<br>then-retreat technique work on enough people to&nbsp;make it a useful procedure for gaining&nbsp;<br>compliance?&quot; If so, it would definitely be something to be aware of in the future. Our&nbsp;<br>second reason for doing the study was to determine how powerful&nbsp;a compliance device&nbsp;<br>the technique was. Could it bring about compliance with a genuinely sizable request?&nbsp;In&nbsp;<br>other words, did the&nbsp;<i>smaller&nbsp;</i>request to which the requester&nbsp;retreated have&nbsp;to be&nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>small&nbsp;<br></i>request? If our thinking&nbsp;about what caused the technique to&nbsp;be effective was correct, the&nbsp;<br>second request did not actually have to be small; it only had to be smaller than the initial&nbsp;<br>one. It was our suspicion that the critical aspect of a requester's retreat from&nbsp;a larger to a&nbsp;<br>smaller&nbsp;<br>
favor was its appearance as a concession. So&nbsp;the second request could be an objectively&nbsp;<br>large one—as long as it was smaller than&nbsp;the first request—and the technique would&nbsp;<br>still work.&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=49></a>39<i>&nbsp;Chapter 2&nbsp;</i><br>
After a bit of thought, we decided to try the technique on a request that we felt few&nbsp;<br>people would agree to perform.&nbsp;Posing as&nbsp;representatives of the &quot;County Youth&nbsp;<br>Counseling Program,&quot; we approached college students walking on campus and asked if&nbsp;<br>they would be willing to chaperon a group of&nbsp;juvenile delinquents on a day trip to the&nbsp;<br>zoo. This idea of being responsible for a group of juvenile&nbsp;delinquents of unspecified&nbsp;<br>age for hours in a public place without pay&nbsp;was hardly an inviting one for these&nbsp;<br>students. As we expected, the great majority&nbsp;(83 percent) refused. Yet we obtained very&nbsp;<br>different results from&nbsp;a similar sample of&nbsp;college students who&nbsp;were asked the very&nbsp;<br>same question with one difference. Before we&nbsp;invited them&nbsp;to serve&nbsp;as unpaid chaperons&nbsp;<br>on the zoo trip, we asked them&nbsp;for an even&nbsp;larger favor—to spend two hours per week&nbsp;<br>as counselors to juvenile delinquents for a minimum&nbsp;of two years. It was only after they&nbsp;<br>refused this extreme request, as all did, that&nbsp;we made the small, zoo-trip request. But&nbsp;<br>presenting the zoo trip as a retreat from&nbsp;our&nbsp;initial request,&nbsp;our success&nbsp;rate&nbsp;increased&nbsp;<br>dramatically. Three times as many of the students approached in this manner&nbsp;<br>volunteered to serve as zoo chaperons (Cialdini,&nbsp;Vincent, Lewis, Catalan, Wheeler, &amp;&nbsp;<br>Darby, 1975).&nbsp;<br>
Be assured&nbsp;that&nbsp;any&nbsp;strategy able&nbsp;to triple&nbsp;the percentage of&nbsp;compliance with a&nbsp;<br>substantial request (from 17 to 50 percent in our experiment) will be used often in a&nbsp;<br>variety of natural settings. Labor negotiators, for instance, often use the tactic of making&nbsp;<br>extreme demands that they do not expect to&nbsp;win but from&nbsp;which they can retreat and&nbsp;<br>draw real concessions from&nbsp;the opposing side.&nbsp;It would appear, then, that the procedure&nbsp;<br>would be more effective the larger the initial request, since there&nbsp;would be more room&nbsp;<br>available for illusory concessions.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;true only up to a point, however. Research&nbsp;<br>conducted at Barllan University in Israel&nbsp;on the rejection-then-retreat technique shows&nbsp;<br>that if&nbsp;the first set of&nbsp;demands is so extreme as to be seen as unreasonable, the tactic&nbsp;<br>backfires (Schwarzwald, Raz, &amp; Zvibel, 1979). In such cases, the party who has made&nbsp;<br>the extreme first request is not seen to&nbsp;be bargaining in good faith. Any subsequent&nbsp;<br>retreat from&nbsp;that wholly unrealistic initial position is not viewed as a genuine concession&nbsp;<br>and, thus, is not reciprocated. The truly gifted negotiator,&nbsp;then, is one&nbsp;whose initial&nbsp;<br>position is exaggerated just enough to allow for&nbsp;a series of small reciprocal concessions&nbsp;<br>and counteroffers that will yield a desirable final offer from the opponent (Thompson,&nbsp;<br>1990).&nbsp;<br>
I witnessed another&nbsp;form&nbsp;of&nbsp;the rejection-then-retreat technique in&nbsp;my&nbsp;investigations of&nbsp;<br>door-to-door sales operations. These organizations used a less engineered, more&nbsp;<br>opportunistic version of the tactic. Of&nbsp;course, the most important goal for a door-to-door&nbsp;<br>salesperson&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;make the&nbsp;sale.&nbsp;However, the training&nbsp;programs of&nbsp;each of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>companies I investigated emphasized that&nbsp;a second important goal was to obtain from&nbsp;<br>prospects the names of referrals—friends, relatives, or neighbors, on whom the&nbsp;<br>salesperson could call. For a variety of reasons, which we will discuss in Chapter 5, the&nbsp;<br>percentage of successful door-to-door sales increases impressively when the&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

sales&nbsp;representative&nbsp;is&nbsp;able&nbsp;to&nbsp;mention the name of a familiar person who&nbsp;<br>&quot;recommended&quot; the sales visit.&nbsp;<br>
Never as a sales trainee was I taught to get the sales pitch refused so that I could then&nbsp;<br>retreat to a request for referrals. In several such programs, though, I was trained to take&nbsp;<br>advantage of the opportunity to secure referrals offered by a customer's&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;<br>refusal: &quot;Well, if&nbsp;it is your feeling that a fine&nbsp;set of encyclopedias is&nbsp;not right for you at&nbsp;<br>this time, perhaps you could help me by giving me&nbsp;the names of some&nbsp;others who might&nbsp;<br>wish to take advantage of our company's great&nbsp;offer. What would be the names of some&nbsp;<br>of these people you know?&quot; Many individuals&nbsp;who would not otherwise subject their&nbsp;<br>friends to a high-pressure sales presentation do agree to supply referrals when the&nbsp;<br>request is presented as a concession from&nbsp;a purchase request they have just refused.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Reciprocal Concessions, Perceptual&nbsp;Contrast, and the Watergate Mystery</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
We have already discussed one reason for&nbsp;the success of&nbsp;the rejection-then-retreat&nbsp;<br>technique—its incorporation of&nbsp;the reciprocity rule. This larger-then-smaller-request&nbsp;<br>

strategy is effective for a pair of other reasons as well. The first concerns&nbsp;the perceptual&nbsp;<br>contrast principle we encountered in Chapter 1. That principle accounted for, among&nbsp;<br>other things, the tendency of a man&nbsp;to spend more money on a sweater&nbsp;<i>following&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>his&nbsp;<br>purchase of a suit than before: After being exposed to&nbsp;the price&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;larger&nbsp;item,&nbsp;he&nbsp;<br>sees the price of the less expensive item&nbsp;as&nbsp;<i>appearing&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>smaller by comparison. In the&nbsp;<br>same&nbsp;way, the larger-then-smaller request procedure uses the contrast&nbsp;principle to make&nbsp;<br>the smaller request look even smaller by comparison with the larger&nbsp;one. If I want you&nbsp;<br>to lend me $5,1 can make the request seem&nbsp;smaller than it is by first asking you to lend&nbsp;<br>me&nbsp;$10. One of the beauties of&nbsp;this tactic is that, by&nbsp;first requesting $10 and then&nbsp;<br>retreating to $5,1 will have simultaneously engaged the force of&nbsp;both the reciprocity rule&nbsp;<br>and the contrast principle. Not only will my&nbsp;$5 request be viewed as a concession to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<br>reciprocated, it will also&nbsp;look like a smaller&nbsp;request than if I had just asked for $5&nbsp;<br>straightaway.&nbsp;<br>
In combination, the influences&nbsp;of reciprocity and perceptual contrast can present a&nbsp;<br>fearsomely powerful force. Embodied in the&nbsp;rejection-then-retreat&nbsp;sequence, they are&nbsp;<br>jointly capable of genuinely astonishing effects. It is my feeling that they provide the&nbsp;<br>only really plausible explanation of one of the most baffling political actions of our&nbsp;<br>time: the decision to break into the Watergate offices of the Democratic National&nbsp;<br>Committee that led to the ruin of Richard Nixon's presidency. One of&nbsp;the participants in&nbsp;<br>that decision, Jeb Stuart Magruder, upon hearing that the Watergate burglars had been&nbsp;<br>caught, responded with appropriate bewilderment, &quot;How could we have been so&nbsp;<br>stupid?&quot; Indeed, how?&nbsp;<br>
To understand how enormously ill-conceived an idea it&nbsp;was for the Nixon&nbsp;<br>administration to undertake the break-in, let's review a few facts:&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;The idea was that of G. Gordon Liddy, who&nbsp;was in charge of intelligence-gathering&nbsp;<br>operations for the Committee to Re-elect the President (CREEP).&nbsp;Liddy had gained a&nbsp;<br>reputation among administration higher-ups as&nbsp;&quot;flaky,&quot; and there were questions about&nbsp;<br>his stability and judgment.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;Liddy's proposal was extremely costly, requiring a budget of $250,000 in un-traceable&nbsp;<br>cash.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;In late March, when the proposal was approved in a meeting of the CREEP director,&nbsp;<br>John Mitchell, and his assistants Magruder and Frederick LaRue, the outlook for a&nbsp;<br>Nixon victory in the November election could not have been brighter. Edmund Muskie,&nbsp;<br>the only announced candidate the early polls had given a chance of unseating the&nbsp;<br>president, had done poorly in&nbsp;the primaries. It looked very much as though the most&nbsp;<br>defeatable candidate, George McGovern,&nbsp;would win the Democratic nomination. A&nbsp;<br>Republican victory seemed assured.&nbsp;<br>

<i>Reciprocation 42&nbsp;</i><br>
•&nbsp;The break-in plan itself was a highly risky operation requiring the participation and&nbsp;<br>discretion of&nbsp;ten men.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;The Democratic National Committee and its chairman, Lawrence O'Brien, whose&nbsp;<br>Watergate office was to be burglarized&nbsp;and bugged, had no information damaging&nbsp;<br>enough to defeat the incumbent president.&nbsp;Nor were the Democrats likely to get any,&nbsp;<br>unless the administration did something&nbsp;<i>very, very&nbsp;</i>foolish.&nbsp;<br>

Despite the obvious counsel of the previously mentioned reasons, the expensive,&nbsp;<br>chancy, pointless, and potentially calamitous proposal of a man whose judgment was&nbsp;<br>known to be questionable was approved. How could it be that intelligent, accomplished&nbsp;<br>men such as Mitchell and Magruder would do something so&nbsp;<i>very, very&nbsp;</i>foolish?&nbsp;Perhaps&nbsp;<br>the answer lies in&nbsp;a little-discussed fact: The $250,000&nbsp;plan they approved was not&nbsp;<br>Liddy's first proposal. In fact, it represented&nbsp;a significant concession on his part from&nbsp;<br>two earlier proposals of immense proportions. The first of these plans, made two&nbsp;<br>months earlier in&nbsp;a meeting with&nbsp;Mitchell, Magruder, and John Dean, described a $1&nbsp;<br>million program&nbsp;that included (in addition to&nbsp;the bugging of the Watergate) a specially&nbsp;<br>equipped communications &quot;chase plane,&quot; break-ins, kidnapping and mugging squads,&nbsp;<br>and a yacht featuring&nbsp;&quot;high-class call girls&quot; to&nbsp;blackmail Democratic&nbsp;politicians.&nbsp;A&nbsp;<br>second Liddy plan, presented a week later to&nbsp;the same group of Mitchell, Magruder, and&nbsp;<br>Dean, eliminated some&nbsp;of the program&nbsp;and reduced the cost to $500,000. It was only&nbsp;<br>after these&nbsp;initial proposals had been rejected by Mitchell that Liddy&nbsp;submitted his&nbsp;<br>&quot;bare-bones&quot; $250,000 plan, in&nbsp;this instance to Mitchell,&nbsp;Magruder, and Frederick&nbsp;<br>LaRue. This time the plan, still stupid but less so than the previous ones, was approved.&nbsp;<br>
Could it be that I, a longtime patsy, and John Mitchell, a hardened and canny politician,&nbsp;<br>might both have been so easily maneuvered&nbsp;into bad deals by the same compliance&nbsp;<br>tactic—I by a Boy Scout selling candy&nbsp;and he by a man selling political&nbsp;disaster?&nbsp;<br>
If we examine the testimony of Jeb Magruder, considered by most Watergate&nbsp;<br>investigators&nbsp;to provide&nbsp;the most faithful account of&nbsp;the crucial meeting at&nbsp;which&nbsp;<br>Liddy's plan was finally accepted,&nbsp;there are&nbsp;some instructive clues. First, Magruder&nbsp;<br>(1974) reports that &quot;no one was particularly overwhelmed with the project&quot;; but &quot;after&nbsp;<br>starting at the grandiose&nbsp;sum of $1 million, we thought&nbsp;that probably $250,000 would&nbsp;<br>be an acceptable figure.. .. We&nbsp;were reluctant to send him&nbsp;away with nothing.&quot; Mitchell,&nbsp;<br>caught up in&nbsp;the &quot;feeling&nbsp;that we should leave Liddy a little something .. . signed off on&nbsp;<br>it in the sense of saying, 'Ok, let's give him&nbsp;a quarter of a million dollars and let's see&nbsp;<br>what he can come up with.'&nbsp;&quot; In the context of Liddy's initial extreme requests, it seems&nbsp;<br>that &quot;a quarter of&nbsp;a million dollars&quot; had come to&nbsp;be &quot;a little something&quot; to be left&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>return concession. With the clarity afforded&nbsp;by hindsight, Magruder has recalled Liddy's&nbsp;<br>approach&nbsp;in&nbsp;as succinct an illustration of the rejection-then-retreat technique as I have&nbsp;<br>ever heard.&nbsp;&quot;If he had&nbsp;come to&nbsp;us at the outset and said, 'I&nbsp;have a plan to burglarize and&nbsp;<br>wiretap Larry O'Brien's office,'&nbsp;we might have&nbsp;rejected the idea out of hand. Instead he&nbsp;<br>came to us with his elaborate call-girl/kidnapping/mugging/sabotage/wiretapping&nbsp;<br>scheme.... He had asked for the whole loaf when&nbsp;he was quite content&nbsp;to settle for half&nbsp;<br>or even a quarter.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
It is also instructive that, although he finally deferred to&nbsp;his boss's decision, only one&nbsp;<br>member of the group, Frederick LaRue, expressed any direct opposition to the proposal.&nbsp;<br>Saying with obvious common sense,&nbsp;&quot;I don't think it's&nbsp;worth the risk,&quot; he must have&nbsp;<br>wondered why his colleagues, Mitchell and Magruder, did not share his perspective. Of&nbsp;<br>course, there could be many differences between&nbsp;LaRue and the other two men that may&nbsp;<br>have accounted for their differing&nbsp;opinions regarding the advis-&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=54></a><i>Reciprocation&nbsp;</i>44&nbsp;<br>
ability of Liddy's plan. But one stands out: Of&nbsp;the three, only&nbsp;LaRue had not been&nbsp;<br>present at the prior two meetings, where&nbsp;Liddy had outlined&nbsp;his much more ambitious&nbsp;<br>programs. Perhaps, then, only LaRue was able&nbsp;to see the third proposal for the clunker&nbsp;<br>that it was and to react to it objectively,&nbsp;uninfluenced by the reciprocity and perceptual&nbsp;<br>contrast forces acting upon the others.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Damned If You Do, Damned If You Don't</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
A bit earlier we said that the rejection-then-retreat technique had, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>reciprocity rule, a pair of other factors working in its favor. We have already discussed&nbsp;<br>the first of those factors,&nbsp;the perceptual contrast principle. The&nbsp;additional advantage of&nbsp;<br>the technique is not really a&nbsp;psychological principle,&nbsp;as in the case of the other two&nbsp;<br>factors. Rather, it is more of a purely structural feature of the request sequence. Let's&nbsp;<br>once again say that I wish to borrow $5 from&nbsp;you. By beginning with a request for $10,&nbsp;<br>1 really can't&nbsp;lose. If you agree to it, I will have received from&nbsp;you twice the amount I&nbsp;<br>would have settled for. If, on the other hand, you turn down my initial request, I can&nbsp;<br>retreat to the $5 favor that&nbsp;I desired from&nbsp;the outset and, through the action of the&nbsp;<br>reciprocity and contrast principles, greatly enhance my likelihood of success. Either&nbsp;<br>way, I benefit; it's a case&nbsp;of&nbsp;heads I win, tails you lose.&nbsp;<br>
The clearest&nbsp;utilization&nbsp;of&nbsp;this aspect&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;large-then-small-request&nbsp;sequence occurs in&nbsp;<br>the retail store sales practice of &quot;talking the top of the line.&quot; Here the prospect is&nbsp;<br>invariably shown the deluxe model first. If&nbsp;the customer buys, there is frosting on the&nbsp;<br>store's cake. However, if the customer declines, the salesperson effectively&nbsp;<br>counteroffers with a more reasonably priced&nbsp;model. Some&nbsp;proof of the effectiveness of&nbsp;<br>this procedure comes from&nbsp;a report in&nbsp;<i>Sales Management&nbsp;</i>magazine, reprinted without&nbsp;<br>comment in&nbsp;<i>Consumer Reports:</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>If you&nbsp;were a billiard-table&nbsp;dealer, which would you advertise</i>—<i>the $329 model or the&nbsp;<br>$3,000 model? The chances are you would promote the low-priced item and hope&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>trade the customer up when he comes to buy. But G. Warren Kelley, new business&nbsp;<br>promotion manager at Brunswick, says you would be wrong.... To prove his point,&nbsp;<br>Kelley has actual sales&nbsp;figures from&nbsp;a representative store. . . . During the first&nbsp;week&nbsp;<br>customers .. . were shown the low end of the line ... and then encouraged to consider&nbsp;<br>more expensive models</i>—<i>the traditional trading-up approach.... The average table sale&nbsp;<br>that week was $550. . .. However, during the second week, customers .. . were led&nbsp;<br>instantly to a $3,000 table, regardless&nbsp;of what they wanted to see . .&nbsp;</i>.&nbsp;<i>and then allowed&nbsp;<br>to shop the rest of the line, in&nbsp;declining order of price and quality. The result of selling&nbsp;<br>down was an average sale of over $1,000. (&quot;Quote,&quot; 1975, p. 62)</i>&nbsp;<br>
Given the remarkable effectiveness&nbsp;of the&nbsp;rejection-then-retreat&nbsp;technique, one might&nbsp;<br>think that there could be&nbsp;a substantial disadvantage as well. The victims of the&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=55></a>45&nbsp;<i>Chapter 2</i>&nbsp;<br>
strategy might resent having been cornered into compliance. The resentment could show&nbsp;<br>itself in a couple of ways. First, the victim&nbsp;might decide not&nbsp;to live up to the verbal&nbsp;<br>agreement made with the requester. Second,&nbsp;the victim&nbsp;might come&nbsp;to distrust the&nbsp;<br>manipulative requester, deciding&nbsp;never to deal with that&nbsp;person again. If either or both&nbsp;<br>of these events occurred&nbsp;with any frequency, a requester would want to give serious&nbsp;<br>second thought to the use of the rejection-then-retreat procedure. Research indicates,&nbsp;<br>however, that these victim reactions&nbsp;do not&nbsp;occur with increased frequency when the&nbsp;<br>rejection-then-retreat technique is used. Somewhat astonishingly, it appears that they&nbsp;<br>actually occur&nbsp;<i>less&nbsp;</i>frequently! Before trying to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;why this&nbsp;should be, let's first&nbsp;<br>look at the evidence.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Here's My Blood, and Do Call Again</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
A study published in Canada (Miller, Seligman, Clark, &amp; Bush, 1976) throws light on&nbsp;<br>the question of whether a victim&nbsp;of the rejection-then-retreat tactic will follow through&nbsp;<br>with the agreement to&nbsp;perform&nbsp;a requester's second favor. In addition to recording&nbsp;<br>whether target persons said yes or no to the desired request&nbsp;(to work for two hours a day&nbsp;<br>without pay in a community mental health&nbsp;agency), this experiment also recorded&nbsp;<br>whether they showed up to perform&nbsp;their duties as promised. As usual, the procedure of&nbsp;<br>starting with a larger request (to volunteer for two hours of work per&nbsp;week in the agency&nbsp;<br>for at least two years) produced more verbal agreement to the smaller, retreat request&nbsp;<br>(76 percent), than did the procedure of asking for the smaller request alone (29 percent).&nbsp;<br>The important result, though, concerned the show-up rate&nbsp;<i>of those who volunteered;&nbsp;<br></i>and, again, the rejection-then-retreat procedure was the more&nbsp;effective one (85 versus 50&nbsp;<br>percent).&nbsp;<br>
A different experiment examined whether&nbsp;the rejection-then-retreat sequence caused&nbsp;<br>victims to feel so manipulated that they would refuse any further requests. In this study&nbsp;<br>(Cialdini &amp; Ascani, 1976), the targets were&nbsp;college students&nbsp;who were each asked to&nbsp;<br>give a pint of blood as part of the annual&nbsp;campus&nbsp;blood drive. Targets in one group were&nbsp;<br>first asked to give a pint of blood every six weeks for a minimum of three years. The&nbsp;<br>other targets were asked only to give a single pint of blood. Those of both groups who&nbsp;<br>agreed and later appeared at the blood center&nbsp;were then asked if they would be willing&nbsp;<br>to give their phone numbers so&nbsp;they could be called upon to&nbsp;donate again in the future.&nbsp;<br>Nearly all the students who were about to&nbsp;give a pint of blood as a result of the&nbsp;<br>rejection-then-retreat technique agreed to donate again (84 percent),&nbsp;while less than half&nbsp;<br>of the other students who appeared at the&nbsp;blood center did so (43 percent). Even for&nbsp;<br>future favors, the rejection-then-retreat strategy&nbsp;proved superior.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>The Sweet, Secret Side&nbsp;Effects</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Strangely enough, then, it seems&nbsp;that the rejection-then-retreat tactic not only spurs&nbsp;<br>people to agree to a desired request but actually to carry out the request and, finally, to&nbsp;<br>volunteer to perform&nbsp;further&nbsp;requests.&nbsp;What could&nbsp;there be about the technique&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<i>&nbsp;</i><br>
<hr>
<a name=56></a><i>Reciprocation&nbsp;</i>46&nbsp;<br>
that makes people who have been duped into&nbsp;compliance so likely to continue to&nbsp;<br>comply?&nbsp;For an answer, we might look at a requester's act of concession, which is the&nbsp;<br>heart of the procedure. We have already seen&nbsp;that, as&nbsp;long&nbsp;as it is not viewed as&nbsp;an&nbsp;<br>obvious trick, the concession will likely stimulate a return concession. What we have&nbsp;<br>not yet examined, however, is a little-known&nbsp;pair of positive by-products of the act of&nbsp;<br>concession: feelings of greater responsibility&nbsp;for and satisfaction with the arrangement.&nbsp;<br>It is this set of&nbsp;sweet side effects that&nbsp;enables the&nbsp;technique to move its victims to fulfill&nbsp;<br>their agreements and to engage&nbsp;in further such agreements.&nbsp;<br>
The desirable side effects of making concessions during an interaction with other people&nbsp;<br>are nicely shown in studies of the way people bargain with each other. One experiment,&nbsp;<br>conducted by social psychologists at UCLA, offers an especially apt demonstration&nbsp;<br>(Benton, Kelley, &amp; Liebling, 1972). A subject in that study faced a &quot;negotiation&nbsp;<br>opponent&quot; and was told to bargain with the opponent concerning how to divide between&nbsp;<br>themselves a certain amount of money provided by the experimenters. The subject was&nbsp;<br>also informed that if no&nbsp;mutual agreement&nbsp;could be reached after a certain period&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>bargaining, no one would get&nbsp;any money. Unknown to the&nbsp;subject, the opponent was&nbsp;<br>really an experimental assistant who had been&nbsp;previously instructed to bargain with the&nbsp;<br>subject in one of three ways. With some&nbsp;of&nbsp;the subjects, the opponent made an extreme&nbsp;<br>first demand, assigning virtually all of the&nbsp;money to himself and&nbsp;stubbornly persisted in&nbsp;<br>that demand throughout the negotiations. With another group of subjects, the opponent&nbsp;<br>began with a demand that was moderately favorable to himself; he, too, steadfastly&nbsp;<br>refused to move from&nbsp;that&nbsp;position during the negotiations. With a third group, the&nbsp;<br>opponent began with the extreme demand and&nbsp;then gradually retreated to the more&nbsp;<br>moderate one during the course of the bargaining.&nbsp;<br>
There were three important findings that help us to understand why the rejection-then-<br>retreat technique is so&nbsp;effective. First,&nbsp;compared to the two other approaches, the&nbsp;<br>strategy of starting with an&nbsp;extreme demand and then retreating to the more moderate&nbsp;<br>one produced the most money for the person using it. This result is&nbsp;not very surprising&nbsp;<br>in light of the previous evidence we have&nbsp;seen&nbsp;for the power of larger-then-smaller-<br>request tactics to bring about&nbsp;profitable agreements. It is the pair of additional findings&nbsp;<br>of the study that are more striking.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Responsibility</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
The requester's concession within the rejection-then-retreat technique not only caused&nbsp;<br>targets to say yes more often, it also caused&nbsp;them&nbsp;to feel more responsible for having&nbsp;<br>&quot;dictated&quot;&nbsp;the final agreement. Thus the uncanny ability&nbsp;of the rejection-then-retreat&nbsp;<br>technique to make its targets meet their commitments becomes understandable: A&nbsp;<br>person who feels responsible for the terms of&nbsp;a contract&nbsp;will be more likely to live up to&nbsp;<br>that contract.&nbsp;<br>
<b>Satisfaction</b>&nbsp;<br>
Even though, on the average, they gave the most money to the opponent who used the&nbsp;<br>concessions strategy, the subjects who were the targets&nbsp;of this strategy were the&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=57></a><b>47&nbsp;</b><i>Chapter 2</i>&nbsp;<br>
most satisfied with the final arrangement. It&nbsp;appears that an agreement that has been&nbsp;<br>forged through the concessions&nbsp;of one's opponents is quite satisfying. With this in mind,&nbsp;<br>we can begin to explain the second previously puzzling feature of the rejection-then-<br>retreat tactic—the ability to prompt its victims to agree to further requests. Since the&nbsp;<br>tactic uses a concession to bring about compliance, the victim&nbsp;is likely to feel more&nbsp;<br>satisfied with the arrangement as a result. It stands to reason that people who are&nbsp;<br>satisfied with a given arrangement are more likely to be willing to agree to similar&nbsp;<br>arrangements. As one study of retail sales&nbsp;showed, feeling responsible for getting a&nbsp;<br>better deal&nbsp;led to more satisfaction with the&nbsp;process and more repurchases of the product&nbsp;<br>(Schindler, 1998).&nbsp;<br>
<b>DEFENSE&nbsp;_</b>&nbsp;<br>
Against a requester who employs the rule for reciprocation, you and I face a formidable&nbsp;<br>foe. By presenting us&nbsp;with either an initial&nbsp;favor or an initial concession, the requester&nbsp;<br>will have&nbsp;enlisted a powerful ally in&nbsp;the campaign for our compliance. At first glance,&nbsp;<br>our fortunes in such a situation would appear dismal. We could comply with the&nbsp;<br>requester's wish and, in so doing, succumb&nbsp;to the reciprocity rule. Or, we could refuse to&nbsp;<br>comply and thereby suffer the brunt of&nbsp;the rule's force upon our deeply conditioned&nbsp;<br>feelings of fairness and obligation. Surrender or suffer heavy casualties. Cheerless&nbsp;<br>prospects indeed.&nbsp;<br>
Fortunately, these are not our only choices. With the proper understanding of the nature&nbsp;<br>of our opponent, we can come&nbsp;away from&nbsp;the compliance battlefield unhurt and&nbsp;<br>sometimes even better off&nbsp;than before. It is essential to recognize that&nbsp;the&nbsp;requester&nbsp;who&nbsp;<br>invokes the reciprocation rule (or any other weapon of influence) to gain our&nbsp;<br>compliance is not the real opponent. Such a requester has chosen to become&nbsp;a&nbsp;jujitsu&nbsp;<br>warrior who aligns himself or herself&nbsp;with&nbsp;the sweeping power of reciprocation and then&nbsp;<br>merely releases that power by providing a first favor or concession. The real opponent is&nbsp;<br>the rule. If we are not to be abused by it,&nbsp;we must take steps to defuse its energy.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Rejecting the Rule</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
How does one go about neutralizing the effect&nbsp;of a social rule like the one for&nbsp;<br>reciprocation?&nbsp;It seems too widespread to&nbsp;escape and too strong to overpower once it is&nbsp;<br>activated. Perhaps the answer, then, is to prevent its activation. Perhaps we can avoid a&nbsp;<br>confrontation with the rule&nbsp;by refusing to allow a requester to commission its force&nbsp;<br>against us in the first place. Perhaps by&nbsp;rejecting a requester's initial favor or&nbsp;<br>concessions to us, we can evade the problem. Perhaps; but&nbsp;then, perhaps not. Invariably&nbsp;<br>declining a requester's initial offer of a favor&nbsp;or sacrifice works better in theory than in&nbsp;<br>practice. The major problem&nbsp;is that when it is first presented, it is difficult to know&nbsp;<br>whether such an offer is honest or whether it&nbsp;is the initial step in an exploitation at-&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

tempt. If&nbsp;we always assume&nbsp;the worst, it would not be possible to receive the benefits of&nbsp;<br>any legitimate favors or concessions offered by individuals who had no intention of&nbsp;<br>exploiting the reciprocity rule.&nbsp;<br>
I have a colleague who remembers with anger how his 10-year-old daughter's feelings&nbsp;<br>were terribly hurt by a man whose method of&nbsp;avoiding the jaws of the reciprocity rule&nbsp;<br>was to refuse her kindness. The children of&nbsp;her class were hosting an open house at&nbsp;<br>school for their grandparents, and her job was to give a flower&nbsp;to each visitor entering&nbsp;<br>the school grounds. The first man she approached&nbsp;with a flower growled at her, &quot;Keep&nbsp;<br>it.&quot; Not knowing what to do, she extended it toward him again, only to have him&nbsp;<br>demand to know what he had to give in return. When she replied weakly, &quot;Nothing. It's&nbsp;<br>a gift,&quot; he fixed her with a disbelieving glare, insisting that he recognized &quot;her game,&quot;&nbsp;<br>and brushed on past. The girl was so stung by the experience that she could not&nbsp;<br>approach anyone else and had to be removed from&nbsp;her assignment — one she had&nbsp;<br>anticipated fondly. It is hard&nbsp;to know whom to blame more, the insensitive man or the&nbsp;<br>exploiters who had abused his tendency to&nbsp;reciprocate a gift until his response had&nbsp;<br>soured to a refusal. No matter whom&nbsp;you find more blameworthy, the lesson is clear.&nbsp;<br>We&nbsp;will always encounter authentically generous individuals as&nbsp;well as many people&nbsp;<br>who try to play fairly by&nbsp;the reciprocity rule&nbsp;rather than to exploit it. They will doubtless&nbsp;<br>become&nbsp;insulted by someone who consistently&nbsp;rejects&nbsp;their efforts;&nbsp;social friction and&nbsp;<br>isolation could well result. A policy&nbsp;of&nbsp;blanket rejection, then, seems ill advised.&nbsp;<br>
Another solution holds more promise. It advises us to accept the offers of others but to&nbsp;<br>accept those offers only for what they&nbsp;fundamentally are, not for what they&nbsp;are&nbsp;<br>represented to be. If a person&nbsp;offers us a nice favor, let's say, we might well accept,&nbsp;<br>recognizing that we have obligated ourselves&nbsp;to a return favor sometime in the future.&nbsp;<br>To engage in this sort of arrangement with&nbsp;another is not to be exploited by that person&nbsp;<br>through the rule for reciprocation. Quite the contrary; it is to participate fairly in the&nbsp;<br>&quot;honored network of obligation&quot; that has&nbsp;served us so well,&nbsp;both individually and&nbsp;<br>societally, from&nbsp;the dawn of humanity. However,&nbsp;if&nbsp;the&nbsp;initial favor turns out to be&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>device, a trick, an artifice&nbsp;designed specifically to stimulate our compliance with&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>larger return favor, that&nbsp;is&nbsp;a different&nbsp;story. Our partner is not&nbsp;a benefactor but a&nbsp;<br>profiteer; and it is here that we should respond to the action on precisely those terms.&nbsp;<br>Once we have determined that the initial offer was not a favor but&nbsp;a compliance tactic,&nbsp;<br>we need only react to it accordingly to be free of its influence. As long as we perceive&nbsp;<br>and define the action as a compliance device instead of a favor, the giver no longer has&nbsp;<br>the reciprocation rule as&nbsp;an ally: The rule says that favors are to be met with favors;&nbsp;it&nbsp;<br>does not require that tricks be met with favors.&nbsp;<br>

A practical example may make things more&nbsp;concrete. Let's suppose that a woman&nbsp;<br>phoned one day and introduced herself as&nbsp;a member of the Home Fire Safety&nbsp;<br>Association in your town. Suppose she then asked if you would be interested in learning&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=59></a><b>49&nbsp;</b><i>Chapter 2</i>&nbsp;<br>
about home&nbsp;fire safety,&nbsp;having your house checked for fire hazards, and receiving a&nbsp;<br>home&nbsp;fire extinguisher—all&nbsp;free of charge. Let's suppose further that you were&nbsp;<br>interested in these things and made an&nbsp;evening appointment to have one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>association's&nbsp;inspectors come&nbsp;over to provide them.&nbsp;When the&nbsp;inspector arrived, he gave&nbsp;<br>you a small hand extinguisher and&nbsp;began examining the possible fire hazards of your&nbsp;<br>home. Afterward he gave you some&nbsp;interesting, though frightening, information about&nbsp;<br>general fire dangers, along with an assessment of your home's vulnerability. Finally he&nbsp;<br>suggested that you obtain a home fire warning system&nbsp;for your house and left.&nbsp;<br>
Such a set of events is not implausible.&nbsp;Various cities and towns have nonprofit&nbsp;<br>associations, usually made up of fire department personnel working on their own time,&nbsp;<br>that provide free home&nbsp;fire-safety inspections of this sort. Were these events to occur,&nbsp;<br>you would clearly have received a favor from&nbsp;the inspector. In accordance with the&nbsp;<br>reciprocation rule, you should stand more ready&nbsp;to provide a return favor if you were to&nbsp;<br>see him&nbsp;in need of aid at some point in the&nbsp;future. An exchange of favors of this kind&nbsp;<br>would be in the best tradition of the reciprocity rule.&nbsp;<br>
A similar set of events with, however, a different ending is also possible. Rather than&nbsp;<br>leaving after recommending a fire-alarm&nbsp;system, the inspector launches into a sales&nbsp;<br>presentation intended to persuade you to buy&nbsp;an expensive, heat-triggered alarm&nbsp;system&nbsp;<br>manufactured by the company he represents. Door-to-door home&nbsp;fire-alarm&nbsp;companies&nbsp;<br>will frequently use this&nbsp;approach.&nbsp;Typically, their product,&nbsp;while effective enough, will&nbsp;<br>be overpriced. Trusting&nbsp;that you will not be&nbsp;familiar with&nbsp;the retail costs of such a&nbsp;<br>system&nbsp;and that, if you decide to buy one,&nbsp;you will feel obligated&nbsp;to&nbsp;the company that&nbsp;<br>provided you with a free extinguisher and home&nbsp;inspection, these companies will&nbsp;<br>pressure you for an immediate sale. Using&nbsp;this free-information-and-inspection&nbsp;gambit,&nbsp;<br>fire-protection sales organizations&nbsp;have flourished around the country.4&nbsp;<br>
If you were to find yourself in such a situation with the realization that the primary&nbsp;<br>motive of the inspector's visit was to sell you&nbsp;a costly alarm&nbsp;system, your most effective&nbsp;<br>next action would be a simple, private maneuver. It would involve&nbsp;the mental act of&nbsp;<br>redefinition. Merely define whatever&nbsp;you have received from the inspector—&nbsp;<br>extinguisher, safety information, hazard inspection—not as gifts but as sales devices,&nbsp;<br>and you will be free to decline (or accept) the purchase offer without even a tug from&nbsp;<br>
4A variety of other business operations use the no-cost information offer extensively.&nbsp;<br>Pest exterminator companies, for instance,&nbsp;have found that most people who agree to a&nbsp;<br>free home examination give the extermination job to the examining company, provided&nbsp;<br>they are convinced that it is needed. They apparently feel an obligation to give their&nbsp;<br>business&nbsp;to&nbsp;the firm&nbsp;that rendered the&nbsp;initial,&nbsp;complimentary service. Knowing that&nbsp;such&nbsp;<br>customers are unlikely to comparison shop&nbsp;for this reason, unscrupulous pest control&nbsp;<br>operations will take advantage of&nbsp;the situation by citing higher-than-competitive prices&nbsp;<br>for work commissioned in this way.&nbsp;<br>

the reciprocity rule: A favor rightly follows&nbsp;a favor—not a piece of sales strategy. If the&nbsp;<br>inspector subsequently responds to your refusal by proposing that you, at least, provide&nbsp;<br>the names of some&nbsp;friends he might call&nbsp;on, use your mental maneuver again. Define&nbsp;<br>this retreat to a smaller request as what&nbsp;you recognize it to be—a compliance tactic.&nbsp;<br>Once this is done, there would be&nbsp;no pressure to offer the names as a return concession,&nbsp;<br>since the reduced request would not be viewed as a real concession. At this point,&nbsp;<br>unhampered by an inappropriately triggered&nbsp;sense of obligation, you may once again be&nbsp;<br>as compliant or noncompliant as you wish.&nbsp;<br>
Provided you are so inclined, you might even turn the inspector's own weapon of&nbsp;<br>influence against him.&nbsp;Recall that the rule&nbsp;for reciprocation entitles a person who has&nbsp;<br>acted in a certain way&nbsp;to a dose of the same&nbsp;thing. If you have determined that the &quot;fire&nbsp;<br>inspector's&quot; gifts were used, not as genuine&nbsp;gifts, but to make a profit from&nbsp;you, then&nbsp;<br>you might want to use them&nbsp;to make a profit of your own. Simply take whatever the&nbsp;<br>inspector is&nbsp;willing&nbsp;to provide—safety information, home extinguisher— thank him&nbsp;<br>politely, and show him&nbsp;out the door. After all, the reciprocity rule asserts that if justice&nbsp;<br>is to be done, exploitation attempts should be exploited.&nbsp;<br>
<b>READER'S&nbsp;REPORT 2.2</b>&nbsp;<br>
<b>From a Former Television and Stereo Salesperson</b>&nbsp;<br>
For quite a&nbsp;while, I worked for a major retailer&nbsp;in their television and stereo department.&nbsp;<br>Continued employment was based on the ability to sell service contracts which are&nbsp;<br>warranty extensions offered by the retailer. Once this fact was explained to me I devised&nbsp;<br>the following plan that used the rejection-then-retreat technique,&nbsp;although I didn't know&nbsp;<br>its name at the time.&nbsp;<br>
A customer had the opportunity to buy from&nbsp;one&nbsp;to three years'&nbsp;worth of service contract&nbsp;<br>coverage at the time of the sale, although the&nbsp;credit I got was the same&nbsp;regardless of the&nbsp;<br>length of coverage. Realizing that most people would not be&nbsp;willing to buy&nbsp;three years'&nbsp;<br>worth of coverage, initially, I would advocate to the customer the longest and most&nbsp;<br>expensive plan. This gave me&nbsp;an excellent opportunity later, after being rejected in my&nbsp;<br>sincere attempt to sell the three-year&nbsp;plan, to retreat to the one-year extension and its&nbsp;<br>relatively small price,&nbsp;which I was thrilled&nbsp;to get. This technique proved highly&nbsp;<br>effective, as&nbsp;I sold sales&nbsp;contracts to an&nbsp;average of 70 percent of my&nbsp;customers, who&nbsp;<br>seemed very satisfied in the process, while&nbsp;others in my&nbsp;department clustered around 40&nbsp;<br>percent. I never told anyone how I did it until now.&nbsp;<br>
<i>Author's note: Notice how, as is usually the case, use of the rejection-then-retreat tactic&nbsp;<br>also engages the action of the contrast principle. Not only did the initial higher request&nbsp;<br>make the lower one seem like a retreat, it made that second request seem smaller, too.&nbsp;</i><br>

<i>It is easier to resist at&nbsp;the beginning than at the end.</i>&nbsp;<br>
—LEONARDO DA VINCI&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=62></a>A study done by a pair of Canadian psychologists (Knox &amp; Inkster, 1968) uncovered&nbsp;<br>something fascinating about people at the racetrack: just after placing bets they are&nbsp;<br>much more confident of their horses'&nbsp;chances of winning than they are immediately&nbsp;<br>before laying down the bets. Of course,&nbsp;nothing about the horse's chances actually&nbsp;<br>shifts; it's the same horse, on the same track, in&nbsp;the same field; but&nbsp;in the minds of those&nbsp;<br>bettors, its prospects improve significantly once that ticket is purchased. Although a bit&nbsp;<br>puzzling at first glance,&nbsp;the reason for the&nbsp;dramatic change has to do with a common&nbsp;<br>weapon of social influence. Like the other&nbsp;weapons of influence, this one lies deep&nbsp;<br>within us, directing our actions with quiet power. It is, quite simply, our desire to be&nbsp;<br>(and to appear) consistent with&nbsp;what we have already done.&nbsp;<i>Once we make a choice or&nbsp;<br>take a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave&nbsp;<br>consistently with that commitment.&nbsp;</i>Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways&nbsp;<br>that justify our earlier&nbsp;decision. We&nbsp;simply convince ourselves that we have made the&nbsp;<br>right choice and, no doubt, feel&nbsp;better about our decision (Fazio, Blascovich, &amp; Driscoll,&nbsp;<br>1992).&nbsp;<br>
By way of illustration, let's examine the story of my&nbsp;neighbor Sara and her live-in&nbsp;<br>boyfriend, Tim. After they met, they dated for a while, even after&nbsp;Tim&nbsp;lost his job, and&nbsp;<br>eventually moved in together.&nbsp;Things were&nbsp;never perfect for Sara: She wanted Tim to&nbsp;<br>marry her and to stop his heavy drinking; Tim&nbsp;resisted both ideas.&nbsp;After an&nbsp;especially&nbsp;<br>difficult period of conflict, Sara broke off&nbsp;the relationship and Tim&nbsp;moved out. At the&nbsp;<br>same&nbsp;time, an&nbsp;old boyfriend of Sara's called&nbsp;her. They started seeing each other socially&nbsp;<br>and quickly became engaged and made wedding plans. They had gone so far as to set a&nbsp;<br>date and issue invitations when Tim called. He&nbsp;had repented and wanted to move back&nbsp;<br>in. When Sara told him&nbsp;her marriage plans,&nbsp;he begged her to change her mind; he&nbsp;<br>wanted to be together with her as before. Sara refused, saying she didn't want to live&nbsp;<br>like that again. Tim&nbsp;even offered to marry her,&nbsp;but she still said she preferred the other&nbsp;<br>boyfriend. Finally, Tim&nbsp;volunteered to quit drinking if she would&nbsp;only relent. Feeling&nbsp;<br>that under those conditions Tim&nbsp;had the edge, Sara decided to break her engagement,&nbsp;<br>cancel the wedding, retract the invitations,&nbsp;and let Tim&nbsp;move back in with her.&nbsp;<br>
Within a month, Tim&nbsp;informed Sara that he didn't think he needed to stop drinking after&nbsp;<br>all. A month later, he decided that they&nbsp;should &quot;wait and see&quot; before getting married.&nbsp;<br>Two years have since passed; Tim&nbsp;and Sara continue to live together exactly as before.&nbsp;<br>Tim still drinks, and there are still no&nbsp;marriage plans, yet Sara is more devoted to him&nbsp;<br>than she ever was. She says that being forced to choose taught her&nbsp;that Tim&nbsp;really is&nbsp;<br>number one in her heart. So, after choosing Tim&nbsp;over her other boyfriend, Sara became&nbsp;<br>happier, even though the conditions under which she had made her choice have never&nbsp;<br>been fulfilled. Obviously, horse-race bettors are not alone in their&nbsp;willingness to believe&nbsp;<br>in the correctness of a difficult choice once&nbsp;made. Indeed, we all fool ourselves from&nbsp;<br>time to time in order to keep our thoughts&nbsp;<br>

and beliefs consistent with what we have&nbsp;already done or decided (Conway &amp; Ross,&nbsp;<br>1984; Goethals &amp; Reckman, 1973; Rosenfeld, Kennedy, &amp; Giacalone, 1986). For&nbsp;<br>instance, immediately after casting a ballot,&nbsp;voters believe more strongly that their&nbsp;<br>candidate will win (Regan &amp; Kilduff, 1988).&nbsp;<br>
<b>WHIRRING ALONG</b>&nbsp;<br>
Psychologist?&nbsp;have long understood the power of the consistency principle to direct&nbsp;<br>human action. Prominent early&nbsp;theorists such as Leon Festinger (1957), Fritz Heider&nbsp;<br>(1946), and Theodore Newcomb (1953) viewed the desire for consistency as a central&nbsp;<br>motivator of&nbsp;behavior. Is this tendency to be&nbsp;consistent really strong enough to compel&nbsp;<br>us to do what we ordinarily would not want to&nbsp;<i>do?&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>There is no question about it. The&nbsp;<br>drive to be (and look) consistent&nbsp;constitutes&nbsp;a highly potent weapon of social influence,&nbsp;<br>often causing us to act in ways that are&nbsp;clearly contrary to our&nbsp;own best interest.&nbsp;<br>
Consider what happened when researchers staged thefts&nbsp;on&nbsp;a New York City beach to&nbsp;<br>see if onlookers would&nbsp;risk personal harm&nbsp;to halt the crime. In the study,&nbsp;an accomplice&nbsp;<br>of the researchers would put a beach blanket down five feet from&nbsp;the blanket of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>randomly chosen individual—the experimental subject. After several minutes of&nbsp;<br>relaxing on the blanket and listening&nbsp;to&nbsp;music from&nbsp;a portable radio, the accomplice&nbsp;<br>would stand up and leave the blanket to&nbsp;stroll down the beach. Soon thereafter, a&nbsp;<br>researcher, pretending to be a thief, would&nbsp;approach, grab the radio, and try to hurry&nbsp;<br>away with it. As you might guess, under normal conditions, subjects were very reluctant&nbsp;<br>to put themselves in harm's way by challenging&nbsp;the thief—only four people did so in&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>20 times that&nbsp;the&nbsp;theft was staged. But when&nbsp;the same&nbsp;procedure was tried another 20&nbsp;<br>times with a&nbsp;slight&nbsp;twist,&nbsp;the results were drastically different. In these incidents, before&nbsp;<br>leaving&nbsp;the blanket,&nbsp;the accomplice would simply ask the subject to please &quot;watch&nbsp;my&nbsp;<br>things,&quot; something everyone agreed to do. Now, propelled by the rule for consistency,&nbsp;<br>19 of the 20 subjects became virtual vigilantes, running after and stopping the thief,&nbsp;<br>demanding an explanation, often restraining the thief physically or snatching the radio&nbsp;<br>away (Moriarty, 1975).&nbsp;<br>
To understand why consistency is so powerful a motive, we should recognize that, in&nbsp;<br>most circumstances, consistency is valued and adaptive. Inconsistency is commonly&nbsp;<br>thought to be&nbsp;an undesirable personality&nbsp;trait (Allgeier,&nbsp;Byrne, Brooks, &amp; Revnes, 1979;&nbsp;<br>Asch, 1946). The person whose beliefs, words, and deeds don't match is seen as&nbsp;<br>confused, two-faced, even mentally ill. On the&nbsp;other side, a high degree of&nbsp;consistency&nbsp;<br>is normally associated with personal and intellectual strength. It is&nbsp;the heart of logic,&nbsp;<br>rationality, stability, and honesty. A quote attributed to&nbsp;the great British chemist,&nbsp;<br>Michael Faraday, suggests the extent to which being consistent is approved—sometimes&nbsp;<br>more than being right. When asked after a&nbsp;lecture if&nbsp;he meant to imply that a hated&nbsp;<br>academic rival was always wrong, Faraday glowered at the questioner and replied, &quot;He's&nbsp;<br>not that consistent.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=64></a><i>Commitment and Consistency 55</i>&nbsp;<br>
Certainly, then, good personal consistency is highly valued in&nbsp;our culture—and well it&nbsp;<br>should be. Most of the time we will be better&nbsp;off if our approach to things is well laced&nbsp;<br>with consistency. Without it&nbsp;our lives would be difficult, erratic, and disjointed&nbsp;<br>(Sheldon, Ryan, Rawsthorne, &amp; Ilardi, 1997).&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>The Quick Fix</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Since it is so&nbsp;typically in our best interests&nbsp;to be consistent,&nbsp;we fall into the habit of&nbsp;<br>being automatically&nbsp;consistent&nbsp;even in situations where it is not the&nbsp;sensible way to be.&nbsp;<br>When it occurs unthinkingly, consistency can&nbsp;be disastrous. Nonetheless, even blind&nbsp;<br>consistency has its attractions.&nbsp;<br>
First, like most other forms of automatic&nbsp;responding, it offers a shortcut through the&nbsp;<br>complexities&nbsp;of modern life. Once we have&nbsp;made up our minds about issues, stubborn&nbsp;<br>consistency allows us a very appealing luxury: We don't&nbsp;have to think hard about the&nbsp;<br>issues anymore. We don't really have to&nbsp;sift through the blizzard of information we&nbsp;<br>encounter every day to identify relevant facts; we don't&nbsp;have to expend the mental&nbsp;<br>energy to weigh the pros and cons; we don't&nbsp;have to make any further tough decisions.&nbsp;<br>Instead, all we have to do when&nbsp;confronted with the issues is&nbsp;<i>click&nbsp;</i>on our consistency&nbsp;<br>tape,&nbsp;<i>whirr,&nbsp;</i>and we know just what to believe, say,&nbsp;or do. We need only believe, say, or&nbsp;<br>do whatever is consistent&nbsp;with our earlier decision.&nbsp;<br>
The allure of such a luxury is not to be minimized. It allows us&nbsp;a convenient, relatively&nbsp;<br>effortless, and efficient method for dealing with&nbsp;the complexities of daily life that make&nbsp;<br>severe demands on our mental energies and capacities. It is not hard to understand, then,&nbsp;<br>why automatic consistency is a difficult reaction&nbsp;to curb. It offers us a way to evade the&nbsp;<br>rigors of continuing thought. With our consistency tapes operating, we can go about our&nbsp;<br>business happily excused from&nbsp;having to think too much. As Sir Joshua Reynolds noted,&nbsp;<br>&quot;There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>thinking.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>The Foolish Fortress</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
There is a second, more perverse attraction of mechanical consistency as well.&nbsp;<br>Sometimes it is not the effort of hard, cognitive work that makes us shirk thoughtful&nbsp;<br>activity but the harsh consequences&nbsp;of&nbsp;that activity. Sometimes it is the&nbsp;cursedly clear&nbsp;<br>and unwelcome&nbsp;set of answers provided by&nbsp;straight thinking that makes us mental&nbsp;<br>slackers. There are certain disturbing things&nbsp;we simply would rather not realize.&nbsp;<br>Because it is a preprogrammed and mindless method of responding, automatic&nbsp;<br>consistency can supply a safe hiding place from&nbsp;troubling realizations. Sealed within the&nbsp;<br>fortress walls of rigid consistency, we can&nbsp;be impervious to the sieges of reason.&nbsp;<br>
One night at an introductory lecture given&nbsp;by the Transcendental Meditation program, I&nbsp;<br>witnessed an&nbsp;illustration of&nbsp;the way people will hide inside&nbsp;the walls of&nbsp;consistency to&nbsp;<br>protect themselves from&nbsp;the troublesome consequences of&nbsp;thought. The lecture itself&nbsp;<br>was presided over by two earnest young men and was designed to&nbsp;<br>

recruit new members into the program. The men claimed that the program&nbsp;offered a&nbsp;<br>unique brand of meditation (TM) which would allow us to achieve all manner of&nbsp;<br>desirable things, ranging from simple inner&nbsp;peace to more spectacular abilities— to fly&nbsp;<br>and pass through walls—at the program's advanced (and more expensive) stages.&nbsp;<br>
I had decided to attend the meeting to observe the kind of compliance tactics used in&nbsp;<br>recruitment lectures of this&nbsp;sort and had brought along an interested friend, a university&nbsp;<br>professor whose areas of specialization were&nbsp;statistics and symbolic logic. As the&nbsp;<br>meeting progressed&nbsp;and&nbsp;the lecturers explained the theory behind TM, I noticed my&nbsp;<br>logician friend becoming increasingly restless. Looking more and more pained and&nbsp;<br>shifting about constantly in his seat,&nbsp;he was finally unable to resist. When&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

the leaders called for questions&nbsp;at the end of&nbsp;the lecture, he raised his hand and gently&nbsp;<br>but surely demolished the presentation we had just heard. In less than two minutes, he&nbsp;<br>pointed out precisely where and why&nbsp;the lecturers'&nbsp;complex argument was&nbsp;<br>contradictory, illogical,&nbsp;and unsupportable. The effect on the discussion leaders was&nbsp;<br>devastating. After a confused silence, each&nbsp;attempted a weak&nbsp;reply only to halt midway&nbsp;<br>to confer with his partner and finally to admit that my&nbsp;colleague's points were good ones&nbsp;<br>&quot;requiring further study.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
More interesting to me, though,&nbsp;was the effect upon the rest&nbsp;of the audience. At the end&nbsp;<br>of the question period, the two recruiters were&nbsp;faced with a crowd of audience members&nbsp;<br>submitting their $75 down payments for admission to the TM program. Nudging,&nbsp;<br>shrugging, and chuckling to one another as they took in the payments, the recruiters&nbsp;<br>betrayed signs of giddy bewilderment. After what appeared&nbsp;to have been an&nbsp;<br>embarrassingly clear collapse&nbsp;of their presentation, the meeting had somehow turned&nbsp;<br>into a great success, generating mystifyingly&nbsp;high levels&nbsp;of compliance from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>audience. Although more&nbsp;than a bit puzzled, I chalked up the audience response to a&nbsp;<br>failure&nbsp;to understand&nbsp;the&nbsp;logic of my&nbsp;colleague's arguments. As it turned&nbsp;out, however,&nbsp;<br>just the&nbsp;<i>reverse&nbsp;</i>was the case.&nbsp;<br>
Outside the lecture room&nbsp;after the meeting,&nbsp;we were approached by three members of&nbsp;<br>the audience, each of whom&nbsp;had given a down payment immediately after the lecture.&nbsp;<br>They wanted to know why we had come&nbsp;to&nbsp;the session. We&nbsp;explained, and we asked the&nbsp;<br>same&nbsp;question of them. One was an aspiring&nbsp;actor who wanted desperately to succeed at&nbsp;<br>his craft and had come&nbsp;to the meeting to learn if TM would allow him&nbsp;to achieve the&nbsp;<br>necessary self-control to master the art; the&nbsp;recruiters had assured him&nbsp;that it would. The&nbsp;<br>second described herself&nbsp;as a severe insomniac who hoped that TM would provide her&nbsp;<br>with a way to relax and fall asleep easily&nbsp;at night. The third served as unofficial&nbsp;<br>spokesman. He was failing his college courses,&nbsp;because there didn't seem to be enough&nbsp;<br>time to study. He had come&nbsp;to the meeting to find out if TM could help by training him&nbsp;<br>to need fewer hours of sleep each night; the&nbsp;additional time&nbsp;could then be used for&nbsp;<br>study. It is interesting to note&nbsp;that the recruiters informed him as well as the insomniac&nbsp;<br>that Transcendental Meditation techniques could solve their respective, though opposite,&nbsp;<br>problems.&nbsp;<br>
Still thinking&nbsp;that the three must have&nbsp;signed up because they hadn't understood the&nbsp;<br>points made by my logician friend, I began to question them&nbsp;about aspects of his&nbsp;<br>argument. To my&nbsp;surprise, I found that they&nbsp;had understood his comments quite well; in&nbsp;<br>fact, all too well. It was precisely the cogency of his argument that&nbsp;drove them&nbsp;to sign&nbsp;<br>up for the program&nbsp;on the spot. The spokesman&nbsp;put it best: &quot;Well, I wasn't&nbsp;going to put&nbsp;<br>down any money tonight because I'm really&nbsp;quite broke right now; I was going to wait&nbsp;<br>until the next&nbsp;meeting. But when your buddy started talking, I knew I'd better give them&nbsp;<br>my money now, or I'd go home&nbsp;and start thinking about what he said and&nbsp;<i>never&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>sign&nbsp;<br>up.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
All at once, things began to make sense.&nbsp;These were people with real problems, and&nbsp;<br>they were desperately&nbsp;searching for a way to&nbsp;solve those problems. They were seekers&nbsp;<br>who, if our discussion leaders were to&nbsp;be believed, had found a potencial&nbsp;<br>

solution&nbsp;in TM. Driven&nbsp;by their needs, they&nbsp;very much wanted to believe that TM was&nbsp;<br>their answer.&nbsp;<br>
Now, in the form&nbsp;of my colleague, intrudes the voice of reason,&nbsp;showing the theory&nbsp;<br>underlying their newfound solution to be unsound. Panic! Something must be done at&nbsp;<br>once before logic takes its toll and leaves&nbsp;them without hope once again. Quickly,&nbsp;<br>quickly, walls against reason are needed; and&nbsp;it&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;matter that the&nbsp;fortress to be&nbsp;<br>erected is a foolish one. &quot;Quick, a hiding place from&nbsp;thought! Here, take this money.&nbsp;<br>Whew, safe&nbsp;in the nick of time. No need&nbsp;to think about the issues any longer.&quot; The&nbsp;<br>decision has been made, and from&nbsp;now on the consistency tape can be played whenever&nbsp;<br>necessary: 'TM? Certainly I think&nbsp;it will help me; certainly I expect to continue;&nbsp;<br>certainly&nbsp;I&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;TM.&nbsp;I already put my money down for it, didn't I?&quot; Ah, the&nbsp;<br>comforts of mindless consistency. &quot;I'll just rest&nbsp;right here for a while. It's so much nicer&nbsp;<br>than the worry and strain of that hard, hard search.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Seek and Hide</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
If, as it appears, automatic consistency functions as a shield against thought, it should&nbsp;<br>not be surprising that such consistency can also be exploited by those who would prefer&nbsp;<br>that we respond to their requests without thinking. For the profiteers, whose interest&nbsp;will&nbsp;<br>be served by an unthinking, mechanical reaction to their requests, our tendency for&nbsp;<br>automatic consistency is a gold mine. So clever&nbsp;are they at arranging&nbsp;to have us play our&nbsp;<br>consistency tapes when it profits them&nbsp;that we seldom&nbsp;realize that we have been taken.&nbsp;<br>In fine jujitsu fashion, they structure their interactions with us so that our own need to&nbsp;<br>be consistent&nbsp;leads directly to their benefit.&nbsp;<br>
Certain large toy manufacturers use just such an approach to reduce a problem&nbsp;created&nbsp;<br>by seasonal buying patterns. Of course, the boom time for toy companies occurs before&nbsp;<br>and during the Christmas holiday season. Their&nbsp;problem&nbsp;is that toy sales then go into a&nbsp;<br>terrible slump for the next&nbsp;couple of months. Their customers have already&nbsp;spent the&nbsp;<br>amount in their toy budgets and are stiffly resistant to their children's pleas for more.&nbsp;<br>
So the toy manufacturers are faced with a&nbsp;dilemma: how to keep sales&nbsp;high during the&nbsp;<br>peak season and, at the same&nbsp;time, retain&nbsp;a healthy demand for toys in the immediately&nbsp;<br>following months. Their difficulty certainly doesn't&nbsp;lie in motivating kids to want more&nbsp;<br>toys after Christmas. The problem&nbsp;lies in&nbsp;motivating postholiday spent-out parents to&nbsp;<br>buy another plaything for their already toy-glutted children. What could the toy&nbsp;<br>companies possibly do to produce that unlikely behavior?&nbsp;Some&nbsp;have tried greatly&nbsp;<br>increased advertising campaigns, others have&nbsp;reduced prices during the slack period, but&nbsp;<br>neither of those standard sales devices has&nbsp;proved successful. Both tactics are&nbsp;costly,&nbsp;<br>and have been ineffective in&nbsp;increasing sales to desired&nbsp;levels. Parents are simply not in&nbsp;<br>a toy-buying mood, and the influences of advertising or reduced expense are not enough&nbsp;<br>to shake that stony resistance.&nbsp;<br>
Certain large toy manufacturers, however,&nbsp;think they have found a solution. It's an&nbsp;<br>ingenious one, involving no more than&nbsp;a normal advertising expense and an un-&nbsp;<br>

derstanding of the powerful pull&nbsp;of the need for consistency. My first hint of the way the&nbsp;<br>toy companies'&nbsp;strategy worked came after I fell&nbsp;for it and then, in true patsy form, fell&nbsp;<br>for it again.It was January, and I was in the town's largest toy&nbsp;store. After purchasing&nbsp;all&nbsp;<br>too many gifts there for my&nbsp;son a month before, I had sworn not to enter that store or&nbsp;<br>any like it for a long, long time. Yet there I was,&nbsp;not only in the diabolic place but also&nbsp;<br>in the process of buying my&nbsp;son another expensive toy—a big, electric road-race set. In&nbsp;<br>front of the road-race display I happened to meet a former neighbor who was buying his&nbsp;<br>son the same toy. The odd thing was that we&nbsp;almost never saw each other anymore.&nbsp;In&nbsp;<br>fact, the last&nbsp;time had been a&nbsp;year earlier in the same store when we were both buying&nbsp;<br>our sons an expensive post-Christmas gift—that time a robot that walked, talked, and&nbsp;<br>laid waste. We laughed about our strange pattern of seeing each other only once a year&nbsp;<br>at the same&nbsp;time, in the same place, while doing the same thing. Later that day,&nbsp;I&nbsp;<br>mentioned the coincidence to a friend who, it turned out, had once worked in the toy&nbsp;<br>business.&nbsp;<br>
&quot;No coincidence,&quot; he said knowingly.&nbsp;<br>
&quot;What do you mean, 'No coincidence'?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Look,&quot; he said, &quot;let me ask you a couple&nbsp;of questions about&nbsp;the road-race set you&nbsp;<br>bought this year. First, did you promise your&nbsp;son that he'd&nbsp;get one for Christmas?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Well, yes I did. Christopher had seen a bunch of ads for them&nbsp;on the Saturday morning&nbsp;<br>cartoon shows and said that was what he wanted for Christmas. I saw a couple of ads&nbsp;<br>myself and it looked like fun; so I said OK.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Strike one,&quot; he announced. &quot;Now for my&nbsp;second question. When you went to buy one,&nbsp;<br>did you find all the stores sold out?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&quot;That's right, I did! The stores said they'd&nbsp;ordered some&nbsp;but didn't know when they'd&nbsp;get&nbsp;<br>any more in. So I had to buy Christopher some&nbsp;other toys to make&nbsp;up for the road-race&nbsp;<br>set. But how did you know?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Strike two,&quot; he said. &quot;Just let me ask one more question. Didn't this same sort of thing&nbsp;<br>happen the year before with the robot toy?&quot;&nbsp;Wait a minute ... you're right. That's&nbsp;just&nbsp;<br>what happened. This is incredible. How did you know?&quot; No psychic powers; I just&nbsp;<br>happen to know how several of the big toy companies jack up&nbsp;their January and&nbsp;<br>February sales. They start prior to Christmas with attractive TV ads for certain special&nbsp;<br>toys. The kids, naturally, want what they see and extract Christmas promises for these&nbsp;<br>items from&nbsp;their parents. Now here's where the genius of the companies'&nbsp;plan comes in:&nbsp;<br>They&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>undersupply&nbsp;</i>the&nbsp;stores&nbsp;with&nbsp;the toys&nbsp;they've gotten the parents to promise. Most&nbsp;<br>parents find those toys sold out&nbsp;and&nbsp;are forced to substitute&nbsp;other toys of equal value.&nbsp;<br>The toy manufacturers, of course, make a point&nbsp;of supplying the stores with plenty of&nbsp;<br>these substitutes. Then, after Christmas, the companies start running the ads again for&nbsp;<br>the other, special toys.&nbsp;That juices&nbsp;up&nbsp;the kids to want those toys&nbsp;more than ever.&nbsp;They&nbsp;<br>go running to their parents whining, 'You promised, you promised,'&nbsp;and the adults go&nbsp;<br>trudging off to the store to live up dutifully to their words.&quot;&nbsp;<br>

&quot;Where,&quot; I said, beginning to seethe now, &quot;they meet other parents they haven't seen for&nbsp;<br>a year, falling for the same trick, right?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Right. Uh, where are you going?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&quot;I'm&nbsp;going to take the road-race&nbsp;set right back to the store.&quot;&nbsp;I was so angry I was nearly&nbsp;<br>shouting.&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Wait. Think for a minute first. Why did you buy it this morning?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Because I didn't want to let Christopher down and because I wanted&nbsp;to&nbsp;teach&nbsp;him&nbsp;that&nbsp;<br>promises are to be lived up to.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Well, has any of that changed?&nbsp;Look, if&nbsp;you take his toy away now, he won't&nbsp;<br>understand why. He'll just know that his father broke a promise&nbsp;to him.&nbsp;Is that what you&nbsp;<br>want?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=70></a><i>Commitment and Consistency&nbsp;</i>62&nbsp;<br>
&quot;No,&quot; I said,&nbsp;sighing, &quot;I guess not. So, you're&nbsp;telling me&nbsp;that the toy companies doubled&nbsp;<br>their profits on me&nbsp;for&nbsp;the past two years, and&nbsp;I never even knew it; and now that I do,&nbsp;<br>I'm&nbsp;still trapped—by my&nbsp;own words.&nbsp;So, what you're really telling&nbsp;me is, 'Strike three.'&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;<br>He nodded, &quot;And you're out.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
In the years since, I have observed a variety of parental toy-buying sprees similar to the&nbsp;<br>one I experienced during that particular holiday season—for Beanie&nbsp;Babies, Tickle Me&nbsp;<br>Elmo&nbsp;dolls, Furbies, etc.&nbsp;But, historically,&nbsp;the&nbsp;one that&nbsp;best fits the pattern&nbsp;is that of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>Cabbage Patch Kids, $25 dolls that were&nbsp;promoted heavily during mid-1980s Christmas&nbsp;<br>seasons but were woefully undersupplied to stores. Some&nbsp;of&nbsp;the consequences were a&nbsp;<br>government false advertising charge against&nbsp;the Kids'&nbsp;maker for continuing to advertise&nbsp;<br>dolls that were not available; frenzied groups&nbsp;of adults battling at&nbsp;toy outlets or paying&nbsp;<br>up to $700 apiece at auction for dolls they had&nbsp;<i>promised&nbsp;</i>their children; and an&nbsp;annual&nbsp;<br>$150 million in sales that extended well beyond&nbsp;the Christmas months. During the 1998&nbsp;<br>holiday season, the least available toy that everyone wanted&nbsp;was the Furby, created by a&nbsp;<br>division of toy giant Hasbro. When asked what frustrated, Furby-less&nbsp;parents should tell&nbsp;<br>their kids, a Hasbro spokeswoman advised the kind of promise that&nbsp;has profited toy&nbsp;<br>manufacturers for decades, &quot;I'll try, but if I&nbsp;can't&nbsp;get it for you now, I'll get it for you&nbsp;<br>later&quot; (Tooher, 1998).&nbsp;<br>
<b>COMMITMENT IS THE KEY</b>&nbsp;<br>
Once we realize that the power of consistency is formidable in directing human action,&nbsp;<br>an important practical question&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;arises: How is that force engaged?&nbsp;What&nbsp;<br>produces the&nbsp;<i>click&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>that activates the&nbsp;<i>whirr&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>of the powerful consistency tape? Social&nbsp;<br>psychologists think they know the answer:&nbsp;commitment. If I can get you to make a&nbsp;<br>commitment&nbsp;(that is, to take a stand, to go on&nbsp;record), I will have set the stage for your&nbsp;<br>automatic and ill-considered consistency with&nbsp;that earlier commitment. Once a stand is&nbsp;<br>taken, there is a natural tendency to behave&nbsp;in ways that are stubbornly consistent with&nbsp;<br>the stand.&nbsp;<br>
As we've already seen, social psychologists are not the only ones who understand the&nbsp;<br>connection between commitment&nbsp;and consistency. Commitment&nbsp;strategies are aimed at&nbsp;<br>us by compliance professionals of nearly every&nbsp;sort. Each of&nbsp;the strategies is intended&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>get us to take some action or make some statement that will trap&nbsp;us into later&nbsp;<br>compliance through consistency pressures. Procedures designed to create commitment&nbsp;<br>take various forms. Some are bluntly straightforward; others are among the most subtle&nbsp;<br>compliance tactics we will encounter. On the blunt side, consider the approach of Jack&nbsp;<br>Stanko, used-car sales manager for an Albuquerque auto dealership. While leading a&nbsp;<br>session called &quot;Used Car Merchandising&quot; at&nbsp;a National Auto Dealers Association&nbsp;<br>convention in San Francisco, he advised 100&nbsp;sales-hungry dealers as&nbsp;follows: &quot;Put 'em&nbsp;<br>on paper. Get the customer's OK on paper.&nbsp;Get the money up front. Control 'em. Control&nbsp;<br>the deal. Ask 'em&nbsp;if they would buy the car right now if the&nbsp;price is right.&nbsp;Pin 'em&nbsp;down&quot;&nbsp;<br>(Rubinstein, 1985). Obviously, Mr. Stanko—an expert&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=71></a>63&nbsp;<i>Chapter 3</i>&nbsp;<br>
in these matters—believes that the way to customer&nbsp;compliance is through their&nbsp;<br>commitments, thereby to&nbsp;&quot;control 'em&quot;&nbsp;for profit.&nbsp;<br>
Commitment practices involving substantially more finesse can&nbsp;be just as effective. For&nbsp;<br>instance, suppose you wanted to&nbsp;increase the number of people in your area who would&nbsp;<br>agree to go door-to-door collecting donations&nbsp;for your favorite charity. You would be&nbsp;<br>wise to study the approach taken by social&nbsp;psychologist Steven J. Sherman. He simply&nbsp;<br>called a sample of Bloomington, Indiana, residents as part of a survey he was taking and&nbsp;<br>asked them&nbsp;to predict what they would say if asked to spend three hours collecting&nbsp;<br>money for the American Cancer Society. Of course, not wanting to seem uncharitable to&nbsp;<br>the survey-taker or to themselves, many of&nbsp;these people said that they would volunteer.&nbsp;<br>The consequence of this subtle committment procedure was a 700 percent increase in&nbsp;<br>volunteers when, a few days later,&nbsp;a representative of the&nbsp;American Cancer Society did&nbsp;<br>call and ask for neighborhood canvassers (Sherman, 1980). Using the same&nbsp;strategy, but&nbsp;<br>this time&nbsp;asking citizens to predict whether they would vote on election day, other&nbsp;<br>researchers have been able to&nbsp;increase significantly the turnout at&nbsp;the polls among those&nbsp;<br>called (Greenwald, Carnot, Beach, &amp; Young, 1987; Spangenberg &amp; Greenwald, in&nbsp;<br>press). Courtroom&nbsp;combatants appear to have&nbsp;adopted this practice of extracting a lofty&nbsp;<br>initial commitment that is designed to spur&nbsp;future consistent behavior. When screening&nbsp;<br>potential jurors before a trial, Jo-Ellen Demitrius,&nbsp;the woman currently reputed to be the&nbsp;<br>best consultant in the business&nbsp;of jury selection asks an artful question: &quot;If you were the&nbsp;<br>only person who believed in my&nbsp;client's innocence, could you withstand the pressure of&nbsp;<br>the rest of the jury to change your mind?&quot; How could any self-respecting prospective&nbsp;<br>juror say no?&nbsp;And, having made the promise,&nbsp;how could any self-respecting selected&nbsp;<br>juror repudiate it later?&nbsp;<br>
Perhaps an&nbsp;even more crafty commitment&nbsp;technique has been developed by telephone&nbsp;<br>solicitors for charity. Have you noticed that&nbsp;callers asking you to contribute to some&nbsp;<br>cause or another these days seem&nbsp;to begin&nbsp;things by inquiring about your current health&nbsp;<br>and well-being?&nbsp;&quot;Hello, Mr./Ms. Targetperson,&quot; they say. &quot;How are you feeling this&nbsp;<br>evening?,&quot; or &quot;How are you doing today?&quot; The caller's intent with this sort of&nbsp;<br>introduction is not merely to seem&nbsp;friendly&nbsp;and caring. It is to&nbsp;get you to respond—as&nbsp;<br>you normally do to such polite, superficial inquiries—with a polite, superficial comment&nbsp;<br>of your own: &quot;Just fine&quot; or&nbsp;&quot;Real good&quot; or &quot;I'm&nbsp;doing&nbsp;great, thanks.&quot; Once you have&nbsp;<br>publicly stated that all is well, it becomes much easier for&nbsp;the solicitor to&nbsp;corner you into&nbsp;<br>aiding those for whom&nbsp;all is not&nbsp;well: &quot;I'm&nbsp;glad to hear that,&nbsp;because I'm&nbsp;calling to ask if&nbsp;<br>you'd be willing to make a donation to help&nbsp;out the unfortunate victims of...&quot;&nbsp;<br>
The theory behind this tactic is that people who have just asserted&nbsp;that they are&nbsp;<br>doing/feeling fine—even as a routine part of&nbsp;a sociable exchange—will consequently&nbsp;<br>find it awkward to&nbsp;appear stingy&nbsp;in the&nbsp;context of their own admittedly favored&nbsp;<br>circumstances. If all this sounds a bit far-fetched, consider the findings of consumer&nbsp;<br>researcher Daniel Howard (1990), who put the theory to&nbsp;test. Residents of Dallas,&nbsp;<br>Texas, were called on the phone&nbsp;and asked if they would agree to allow a representative&nbsp;<br>of the Hunger Relief Committee to come&nbsp;to&nbsp;their homes to sell them&nbsp;cookies, the pr&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

ceeds from which would be used to supply meals for the needy. When tried alone, that&nbsp;<br>request (labeled the standard&nbsp;solicitation approach) produced only 18 percent&nbsp;<br>agreement. However, if the caller initially&nbsp;asked, &quot;How are you feeling this evening?&quot;&nbsp;<br>and waited&nbsp;for a reply before proceeding&nbsp;with the standard&nbsp;approach, several&nbsp;<br>noteworthy things happened. First, of the 120 individuals called, most (108) gave the&nbsp;<br>customary favorable reply (&quot;Good,&quot; &quot;Fine,&quot; &quot;Real well,&quot; etc.). Second, 32 percent of the&nbsp;<br>people who got the How-are-you-feeling-tonight question agreed to receive the cookie&nbsp;<br>seller at their homes, nearly twice the success rate of&nbsp;the standard solicitation approach.&nbsp;<br>Third, true to the consistency principle, almost everyone&nbsp;(89 percent) who agreed to&nbsp;<br>such a visit did in fact make a cookie purchase when contacted at home.&nbsp;<br>
The question of what makes a commitment effective has numerous answers. A variety&nbsp;<br>of factors affects the ability of a commitment to constrain our future behavior. One&nbsp;<br>large-scale program&nbsp;designed to produce compliance illustrates how several of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>factors work. The remarkable thing about this program&nbsp;is&nbsp;that it was systematically&nbsp;<br>employing these factors&nbsp;decades ago, well before scientific research had identified&nbsp;<br>them.&nbsp;<br>
During the Korean War, many captured American soldiers found themselves in&nbsp;<br>prisoner-of-war camps run by the Chinese Communists. It became clear early in&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>conflict that&nbsp;the Chinese treated captives quite&nbsp;differently than&nbsp;did their allies, the North&nbsp;<br>Koreans, who favored harsh punishment to gain compliance. Specifically avoiding&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>appearance of brutality,&nbsp;the Red&nbsp;Chinese engaged in what&nbsp;they termed their &quot;lenient&nbsp;<br>policy,&quot; which was, in reality, a concerted&nbsp;and sophisticated psychological assault on&nbsp;<br>their captives. After the war, American psychologists questioned the returning prisoners&nbsp;<br>intensively&nbsp;to determine what had occurred,&nbsp;in&nbsp;part because of&nbsp;the unsettling success of&nbsp;<br>some&nbsp;aspects of the Chinese program. For example, the Chinese were very effective in&nbsp;<br>getting Americans to inform&nbsp;on one another,&nbsp;in striking contrast to the behavior of&nbsp;<br>American POWs&nbsp;in World War II. For this&nbsp;reason, among others, escape plans were&nbsp;<br>quickly uncovered and the escapes themselves almost always unsuccessful. &quot;When an&nbsp;<br>escape did occur,&quot; wrote psychologist Edgar Schein (1956), a principal American&nbsp;<br>investigator of the Chinese indoctrination&nbsp;program&nbsp;in Korea, &quot;the Chinese usually&nbsp;<br>recovered the man easily by offering a bag of&nbsp;rice to anyone turning him&nbsp;in.&quot; In fact,&nbsp;<br>nearly&nbsp;all American prisoners in the&nbsp;Chinese camps are said to have collaborated&nbsp;with&nbsp;<br>the enemy in one way or another.1&nbsp;<br>
An examination of the prison-camp program&nbsp;shows that the Chinese relied heavily on&nbsp;<br>commitment&nbsp;and consistency pressures to gain the desired compliance from&nbsp;their&nbsp;<br>captives. Of course, the first problem&nbsp;facing the Chinese was to find a way to&nbsp;<br>
It is important to&nbsp;note&nbsp;that the collaboration was not always intentional.&nbsp;The American&nbsp;<br>investigators defined collaboration as &quot;any kind of behavior which helped the enmy,&quot;&nbsp;<br>and it thus included such diverse activities as signing peace petitions, running errands,&nbsp;<br>making radio appeals, accepting special favors, making false confessions, informing on&nbsp;<br>fellow prisoners, divulging military information, etc&nbsp;<br>

get any collaboration at all from&nbsp;the Americans. These prisoners had been trained to&nbsp;<br>provide nothing but name, rank,&nbsp;and serial number. Short of&nbsp;physical brutalization, how&nbsp;<br>could the captors hope to get such men to give military information, turn in fellow&nbsp;<br>prisoners, or publicly denounce their country?&nbsp;The Chinese answer was elementary:&nbsp;<br>Start small and build.&nbsp;<br>
For instance, prisoners were frequently asked&nbsp;to make statements that were so mildly&nbsp;<br>anti-American or pro-Communist that they&nbsp;seemed inconsequential (&quot;The United&nbsp;States&nbsp;<br>is not perfect.&quot; &quot;In a Communist country, unemployment is not a problem.&quot;). Once these&nbsp;<br>minor requests had been complied with, however, the men found themselves pushed to&nbsp;<br>submit to related,&nbsp;yet more substantive, requests. A man who had just agreed with his&nbsp;<br>Chinese interrogator that the United States&nbsp;was not perfect might then be asked to&nbsp;<br>indicate some of&nbsp;the ways in which he&nbsp;thought this was the&nbsp;case. Once he had so&nbsp;<br>explained, he might be asked to make a list&nbsp;of these &quot;problems&nbsp;with America&quot; and&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>sign his name to it. Later he might be asked to read his list in&nbsp;a discussion group with&nbsp;<br>other prisoners. &quot;After all, it's what you really believe, isn't it?&quot;&nbsp;Still later, he might be&nbsp;<br>asked to write an essay expanding on his list and discussing these problems&nbsp;in greater&nbsp;<br>detail.&nbsp;<br>
The Chinese might then use his name&nbsp;and his&nbsp;essay in an anti-American radio broadcast&nbsp;<br>beamed not only to the entire camp but to other POW&nbsp;camps in North Korea as well as&nbsp;<br>to American forces in South Korea. Suddenly he would find himself a &quot;collaborator,&quot;&nbsp;<br>having given aid and comfort to the enemy. Aware that&nbsp;he had written the&nbsp;essay without&nbsp;<br>any strong&nbsp;threats&nbsp;or coercion,&nbsp;many times&nbsp;a man would change his self-image to be&nbsp;<br>consistent with the deed&nbsp;and with the new&nbsp;&quot;collaborator&quot; label, often resulting in even&nbsp;<br>more extensive acts of&nbsp;collaboration. Thus, while &quot;only a&nbsp;few men were able to avoid&nbsp;<br>collaboration&nbsp;altogether,&quot;&nbsp;according to Schein, &quot;the majority collaborated&nbsp;at one time or&nbsp;<br>another by doing things which seemed to them&nbsp;trivial but which the&nbsp;Chinese were able&nbsp;<br>to turn to their own advantage.... This was particularly effective in&nbsp;eliciting confessions,&nbsp;<br>self-criticism, and information during interrogation&quot; (1956).&nbsp;<br>

<a name=74></a><i>Commitment and Consistency&nbsp;</i>66&nbsp;<br>
Other groups of people interested in&nbsp;compliance are also&nbsp;aware of the usefulness and&nbsp;<br>power of this approach. Charitable organizations, for instance, will often use&nbsp;<br>progressively escalating commitments to induce individuals to perform&nbsp;major favors.&nbsp;<br>Research has shown that such trivial first&nbsp;commitments as agreeing to be interviewed&nbsp;<br>can begin a &quot;momentum of compliance&quot; that&nbsp;induces such later behaviors as organ or&nbsp;<br>bone marrow donations (Carducci, Deuser, Bauer, Large, &amp; Ramaekers, 1989;&nbsp;<br>Schwartz, 1970).&nbsp;<br>
Many business organizations employ this&nbsp;approach regularly as well. For the&nbsp;<br>salesperson,&nbsp;the strategy&nbsp;is to obtain a&nbsp;large purchase by starting with a small one.&nbsp;<br>Almost any small sale will do because the purpose of&nbsp;that small transaction is not profit,&nbsp;<br>it is commitment. Further purchases, even&nbsp;much larger ones, are&nbsp;expected to flow&nbsp;<br>naturally from&nbsp;the commitment. An article in the trade magazine&nbsp;<i>American Salesman&nbsp;<br></i>put it succinctly:&nbsp;<br>
<i>The general idea is to pave the way for full-line distribution by&nbsp;starting with a small&nbsp;<br>order.... Look at it this way</i>—<i>when a person has signed an order for your merchandise,&nbsp;<br>even though&nbsp;the profit is so small it hardly compensates for the time and effort of&nbsp;<br>making the call, he is no longer a prospect</i>—&nbsp;<i>he is a customer (Green, 1965, p. 14).</i>&nbsp;<br>
The tactic of&nbsp;starting with a little&nbsp;request&nbsp;in order to gain eventual&nbsp;compliance with&nbsp;<br>related larger requests has a name: the foot-in-the-door technique. Social scientists first&nbsp;<br>became aware of its effectiveness in 1966&nbsp;when psychologists Jonathan Freedman and&nbsp;<br>Scott Fraser published an astonishing set of data. They reported the results of an&nbsp;<br>experiment in which a researcher, posing as&nbsp;a volunteer worker,&nbsp;had gone door to door&nbsp;<br>in a residential California neighborhood making a preposterous request of homeowners.&nbsp;<br>The homeowners were asked to allow a public-service billboard to be installed on their&nbsp;<br>front lawns. To get an idea of the way the sign would look, they were shown a&nbsp;<br>photograph depicting an attractive house, the view of which was almost completely&nbsp;<br>obscured by a very large,&nbsp;poorly lettered sign reading DRIVE CAREFULLY. Although&nbsp;<br>the request was normally and understandably refused by the great majority of the&nbsp;<br>residents in the area (only 17 percent complied), one particular group of people reacted&nbsp;<br>quite favorably. A full 76 percent of them&nbsp;offered the use of their front yards.&nbsp;<br>
The prime reason for their startling compliance has to do&nbsp;with something that had&nbsp;<br>happened to them&nbsp;about&nbsp;two weeks earlier: They had made a small commitment to&nbsp;<br>driver safety. A different &quot;volunteer worker&quot;&nbsp;had come&nbsp;to their doors and asked them&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>accept and display a little three-inch-square&nbsp;sign that read BE A&nbsp;SAFE DRIVER. It was&nbsp;<br>such a trifling request that nearly all of&nbsp;them&nbsp;had agreed to it, but the&nbsp;effects of&nbsp;that&nbsp;<br>request were enormous. Because they had innocently complied with&nbsp;a trivial safe-<br>driving request a couple of&nbsp;weeks before, these homeowners became remarkably willing&nbsp;<br>to comply with another such request&nbsp;that was massive in size.&nbsp;<br>
Freedman and Fraser didn't stop there. They&nbsp;tried a slightly different procedure on&nbsp;<br>another sample of homeowners. These people first received a request to sign&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

a petition that favored &quot;keeping California beautiful.&quot; Of course, nearly everyone signed&nbsp;<br>since state beauty, like&nbsp;efficiency in government or sound&nbsp;prenatal care, is one of those&nbsp;<br>issues no&nbsp;one opposes. After waiting about two&nbsp;weeks, Freedman and Eraser sent&nbsp;a new&nbsp;<br>&quot;volunteer worker&quot; to these same homes to ask the residents to allow the big DRIVE&nbsp;<br>CAREFULLY sign to be erected on their lawns. In some&nbsp;ways, the response of these&nbsp;<br>homeowners was the most astounding of any&nbsp;in the study. Approximately half of these&nbsp;<br>people consented to the installation of&nbsp;the DRIVE CAREFULLY billboard, even though&nbsp;<br>the small commitment they had made weeks earlier was&nbsp;not to&nbsp;driver&nbsp;safety but to an&nbsp;<br>entirely different public-service&nbsp;topic, state beautification.&nbsp;<br>
At first, even Freedman and Eraser were&nbsp;bewildered by their findings. Why should the&nbsp;<br>little act of signing a petition supporting state beautification cause people to be so&nbsp;<br>willing to perform&nbsp;a different and much larger&nbsp;favor? After considering and discarding&nbsp;<br>other explanations, Freedman and Fraser&nbsp;came upon one that offered a solution to the&nbsp;<br>puzzle: Signing the beautification petition changed the view these people had&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

of themselves. They saw themselves as public-spirited citizens who acted on their civic&nbsp;<br>principles. When, two weeks later, they were&nbsp;asked to perform&nbsp;another public service by&nbsp;<br>displaying the DRIVE CAREFULLY sign, they complied in order to be consistent with&nbsp;<br>their newly formed self-images.&nbsp;According to Freedman and Fraser:&nbsp;<br>
<i>What may occur is a change in the person's&nbsp;feelings about getting&nbsp;involved or taking&nbsp;<br>action. Once he has agreed to a request, his&nbsp;attitude may change, he may become, in his&nbsp;<br>own eyes, the kind of person who does this sort of thing, who agrees to requests made&nbsp;<br>by strangers, who takes action on things&nbsp;he believes in, who cooperates with good&nbsp;<br>causes, (p. 201)</i>&nbsp;<br>
What the Freedman and Fraser findings tell us,&nbsp;then, is to be very&nbsp;careful about agreeing&nbsp;<br>to trivial requests. Such&nbsp;an agreement can not only increase&nbsp;our compliance with very&nbsp;<br>similar, much larger requests, it can&nbsp;also&nbsp;make us more willing to perform&nbsp;a variety&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>larger&nbsp;favors that are only remotely connected&nbsp;to the little&nbsp;one we did earlier. It's this&nbsp;<br>second, general kind of influence concealed within small commitments that scares me.&nbsp;<br>
It scares me enough that I am&nbsp;rarely willing to sign a petition anymore, even for a&nbsp;<br>position I support. Such an action has the potential to influence not only my&nbsp;future&nbsp;<br>behavior but also my self-image in ways I&nbsp;may not want. Further, once a person's self-<br>image is altered, all sorts of&nbsp;subtle advantages become available to someone who wants&nbsp;<br>to exploit that new image.&nbsp;<br>
Who among Freedman and Eraser's&nbsp;homeowners would have&nbsp;thought that the&nbsp;<br>&quot;volunteer worker&quot; who asked them&nbsp;to sign&nbsp;a&nbsp;state beautification petition was really&nbsp;<br>interested in&nbsp;having them&nbsp;display a safe-driving billboard two weeks later?&nbsp;Who among&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;could have suspected that their decision to display the billboard was largely&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>result of&nbsp;signing the petition?&nbsp;No one, I'd guess. If&nbsp;there were any regrets after the&nbsp;<br>billboard went up, who could they&nbsp;conceivably hold responsible but&nbsp;<i>themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<br>their own damnably strong civic spirits?&nbsp;They probably never even&nbsp;considered the guy&nbsp;<br>with the &quot;keeping California beautiful&quot; petition&nbsp;and all that knowledge&nbsp;of social jujitsu.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Hearts and Minds</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Notice that all of the foot-in-the-door experts seem&nbsp;to be&nbsp;excited about the same&nbsp;thing:&nbsp;<br>You can use small commitments to manipulate a person's self-image; you can use them&nbsp;<br>to turn citizens into &quot;public servants,&quot; prospects into &quot;customers,&quot; prisoners into&nbsp;<br>&quot;collaborators.&quot; Once you've got a person's self-image where you want&nbsp;it, that person&nbsp;<br>should comply&nbsp;<i>naturally&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>with a whole range of requests that are consistent with this&nbsp;<br>new self-view.&nbsp;<br>
Not all commitments affect self-image, however. There are certain conditions that&nbsp;<br>should be present for a commitment to be effective in this way: they should be active,&nbsp;<br>public, effortful, and freely chosen. The major intent of&nbsp;the Chinese was&nbsp;not&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

simply to extract information from&nbsp;their prisoners. It was to indoctrinate&nbsp;them, to&nbsp;<br>change their&nbsp;attitudes and perceptions of&nbsp;themselves, of&nbsp;their political system, of&nbsp;their&nbsp;<br>country's&nbsp;role in the war, and of communism. Dr. Henry Segal, chief of the neuro-<br>psychiatric evaluation team that examined&nbsp;returning POWs at the end of the Korean&nbsp;<br>War, reported that war-related beliefs had been substantially shifted. Significant inroads&nbsp;<br>had been made in the political attitudes of the men:&nbsp;<br>
<i>Many expressed antipathy toward the Chinese&nbsp;Communists but at the&nbsp;same time praised&nbsp;<br>them for &quot;the fine job they had done in&nbsp;China.&quot; Others stated that &quot;although&nbsp;<br>communism won't work in America, I think it's a good thing for Asia.&quot; (Segal, 1954, p.&nbsp;<br></i>360) _&nbsp;<br>
It appears&nbsp;that the real goal of the Chinese&nbsp;was to modify, at least for a time, the hearts&nbsp;<br>and minds of their captives. If we measure their achievement in terms of &quot;defection,&nbsp;<br>disloyalty, changed attitudes and beliefs, poor discipline, poor morale, poor&nbsp;<i>esprit,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<br>doubts as to America's role,&quot; Segal concluded, &quot;their efforts were highly successful.&quot;&nbsp;<br>Let's examine more closely how they managed it.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>The Magic Act</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Our best evidence of people's true feelings and&nbsp;beliefs comes less from&nbsp;their&nbsp;words than&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;their deeds. Observers trying&nbsp;to decide&nbsp;what people are like look&nbsp;closely at their&nbsp;<br>actions. Researchers have discovered&nbsp;that people themselves use this same evidence—<br>their own behavior—to decide what they are&nbsp;like; it is a primary source of information&nbsp;<br>about one's own beliefs, values, and attitudes (Bern, 1972; Vallacher &amp; Wegner, 1985).&nbsp;<br>
The rippling impact of behavior on one's self-concept and future behavior can be seen in&nbsp;<br>research investigating the effect of active versus passive commitments (Allison &amp;&nbsp;<br>Messick, 1988; Fazio, Sherman, &amp;&nbsp;Herr, 1982). For instance, in one study, college&nbsp;<br>students volunteered for an AIDS education project in the local schools. The researchers&nbsp;<br>arranged for half&nbsp;to volunteer actively by filling out a form&nbsp;stating that they wanted to&nbsp;<br>participate. The other half volunteered passively&nbsp;<i>by failing&nbsp;</i>to fill out a&nbsp;form&nbsp;stating&nbsp;that&nbsp;<br>they&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>want to&nbsp;participate.&nbsp;Three to&nbsp;four days later, when asked to begin their&nbsp;<br>volunteer activity, the great majority (74 percent) who actually appeared for duty came&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;the ranks of those who had actively agreed&nbsp;to participate. What's more, those who&nbsp;<br>volunteered actively were more likely to&nbsp;explain their decisions by implicating their&nbsp;<br>personal values, preferences, and traits (Cioffi &amp; Garner, 1996). In&nbsp;all, it seems that&nbsp;<br>active commitments give us the kind of information we use to shape self-image, which&nbsp;<br>then shapes future actions, which solidify the new self-image.&nbsp;<br>
Understanding fully this route&nbsp;to altered self-perception, the Chinese&nbsp;set about arranging&nbsp;<br>the prison-camp experience so that&nbsp;their captives would consistently&nbsp;<i>act&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>in desired&nbsp;<br>ways. Before long, the Chinese knew, these actions would begin to take&nbsp;<br>

their toll,&nbsp;causing the prisoners&nbsp;to&nbsp;change their&nbsp;views of&nbsp;themselves to align with what&nbsp;<br>they had done.&nbsp;<br>
Writing was one sort of committing action that the Chinese urged incessantly upon the&nbsp;<br>captives. It was never enough for&nbsp;prisoners to listen&nbsp;quietly or even&nbsp;to agree verbally&nbsp;<br>with the Chinese line; they were always pushed to write it down as well. Schein (1956)&nbsp;<br>describes a standard indoctrination session tactic of&nbsp;the Chinese:&nbsp;<br>
<i>A further technique was to have the man write out the question&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;the&nbsp;[pro-<br>Communist]&nbsp;answer. If he refused to write it voluntarily, he was asked to copy it from&nbsp;<br>the notebooks, which must have seemed like a harmless enough concession, (p. 161)</i>&nbsp;<br>
Oh, those &quot;harmless&quot; concessions. We've already seen how apparently trifling&nbsp;<br>commitments can lead to further consistent behavior. As a commitment device, a&nbsp;<br>written declaration has some&nbsp;great advantages. First, it provides physical evidence that&nbsp;<br>an act has occurred. Once a prisoner wrote what the Chinese wanted, it was very&nbsp;<br>difficult for him&nbsp;to believe that he had not done so. The opportunities to forget or to&nbsp;<br>deny to himself what he had done were not available, as they were for purely verbal&nbsp;<br>statements. No; there it was in his own&nbsp;handwriting, an irrevocably documented act&nbsp;<br>driving him to make his beliefs and his self-image consistent&nbsp;with&nbsp;what he had&nbsp;<br>undeniably done. Second, a written testament can be shown to&nbsp;other people. Of course,&nbsp;<br>that means it can be used to persuade those&nbsp;people. It can persuade them&nbsp;to change their&nbsp;<br>own attitudes in the direction of&nbsp;the statement. More importantly for the purpose&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>commitment, it can persuade them&nbsp;that the&nbsp;author genuinely believes what was written.&nbsp;<br>
People have&nbsp;a natural tendency to&nbsp;think that&nbsp;a statement reflects&nbsp;the&nbsp;true&nbsp;attitude of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>person who made it. What is surprising is that they continue&nbsp;to think so even when they&nbsp;<br>know that the person did not freely choose to&nbsp;make the statement. Some&nbsp;scientific&nbsp;<br>evidence that this is the case comes from&nbsp;a study by psychologists Edward Jones and&nbsp;<br>James Harris (1967), who showed people an essay that was favorable to Fidel Castro&nbsp;<br>and asked them&nbsp;to guess&nbsp;the true feelings of its author. Jones and Harris told some&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>these people that the author had chosen to&nbsp;write a pro-Castro essay; they told other&nbsp;<br>people that the author&nbsp;had been&nbsp;required to write in favor&nbsp;of Castro. The&nbsp;strange thing&nbsp;<br>was that even those people who knew that&nbsp;the author&nbsp;had been&nbsp;assigned to do a pro-<br>Castro essay guessed that the writer liked Castro. It seems that&nbsp;a statement of belief&nbsp;<br>produces a&nbsp;<i>click, whirr response&nbsp;</i>in those who view it. Unless&nbsp;there is strong evidence to&nbsp;<br>the contrary,&nbsp;observers automatically&nbsp;assume that someone who makes such a statement&nbsp;<br>means it (Allison, Mackie, Muller, &amp; Worth, 1993).&nbsp;<br>
Think of the double-barreled effects on the self-image of a prisoner who wrote a pro-<br>Chinese or anti-American statement. Not only was it a lasting personal reminder of his&nbsp;<br>action,&nbsp;it was also&nbsp;likely&nbsp;to&nbsp;persuade those around him&nbsp;that&nbsp;it reflected his actual beliefs.&nbsp;<br>As we will see in&nbsp;Chapter 4,&nbsp;what those around us think is true of&nbsp;us&nbsp;is enormously&nbsp;<br>important in&nbsp;determining&nbsp;what we ourselves think&nbsp;is true. For&nbsp;<br>

example, one study found that one week after hearing that they were considered&nbsp;<br>charitable people, homemakers in New Haven, Connecticut, gave much more money to&nbsp;<br>a canvasser from&nbsp;the Multiple Sclerosis Association (Kraut, 1973). Apparently&nbsp;the mere&nbsp;<br>knowledge that someone viewed them&nbsp;as charitable caused these people to make their&nbsp;<br>actions consistent&nbsp;with that view.&nbsp;<br>
Savvy politicians have long used the committing&nbsp;character of labels&nbsp;to great advantage.&nbsp;<br>One of the best at it was former president&nbsp;of Egypt, Anwar Sadat. Before international&nbsp;<br>negotiations began, Sadat would assure his bargaining opponents that they and the&nbsp;<br>citizens of their country were widely known&nbsp;for their cooperativeness and fairness. With&nbsp;<br>this kind of&nbsp;flattery,&nbsp;he not only created positive feelings, he also connected his&nbsp;<br>opponent's&nbsp;identities to a course of action that&nbsp;served his goals. According to master-<br>negotiator, Henry Kissinger (1982),&nbsp;Sadat was successful because he got others to act in&nbsp;<br>his interests by giving them&nbsp;a reputation to uphold.&nbsp;<br>
Once an active commitment is made, then, self-image is squeezed from both sides by&nbsp;<br>consistency pressures. From&nbsp;the inside, there is&nbsp;a pressure to bring self-image into line&nbsp;<br>with action. From&nbsp;the outside, there is a sneakier pressure—a tendency to adjust this&nbsp;<br>image according to the way others perceive us (Schlenker, Dlugolecki, &amp; Doherty,&nbsp;<br>1994). Because others see us as believing what we have written (even when we've had&nbsp;<br>little choice in the matter), we once again experience a pull to&nbsp;bring self-image into line&nbsp;<br>with the written statement.&nbsp;<br>
In Korea, several subtle devices were used&nbsp;to get prisoners to write, without direct&nbsp;<br>coercion, what the Chinese wanted. For example, the Chinese knew that many prisoners&nbsp;<br>were anxious to let their&nbsp;families know that&nbsp;they&nbsp;were alive. At the same time, the men&nbsp;<br>knew that their captors&nbsp;were censoring the mail and that only some letters were being&nbsp;<br>allowed out of camp. To ensure&nbsp;that their own letters should&nbsp;be released, some&nbsp;prisoners&nbsp;<br>began including in their messages peace appeals, claims of kind treatment, and&nbsp;<br>statements sympathetic to communism. The hope&nbsp;was that the Chinese would want such&nbsp;<br>letters to surface and would, therefore, allow&nbsp;their delivery. Of course, the Chinese were&nbsp;<br>happy to cooperate because those letters served their interests marvelously. First, their&nbsp;<br>worldwide propaganda effort benefited greatly from&nbsp;the appearance of pro-Communist&nbsp;<br>statements by American servicemen. Second,&nbsp;in the service of prisoner indoctrination,&nbsp;<br>the Chinese had, without raising a finger of physical force, gotten many men to go on&nbsp;<br>record supporting the Communist cause. A&nbsp;similar technique involved&nbsp;political essay&nbsp;<br>contests that&nbsp;were regularly held in camp. The prizes&nbsp;for winning were invariably&nbsp;<br>small—a few cigarettes or&nbsp;a bit of&nbsp;fruit—but were&nbsp;sufficiently&nbsp;scarce that they&nbsp;<br>generated a lot of&nbsp;interest from&nbsp;the men. Usually the winning&nbsp;essay was one that took&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>solidly pro-Communist stand ... but not always. The Chinese were wise enough to&nbsp;<br>realize that most of the prisoners would not enter a contest&nbsp;that they thought they could&nbsp;<br>win only by writing a Communist tract. Moreover, the Chinese were clever enough to&nbsp;<br>know how to plant in&nbsp;the captives&nbsp;small commitments to communism&nbsp;that could be&nbsp;<br>nurtured into later bloom. So, occasionally, the winning essay was one that generally&nbsp;<br>supported the United States but that bowed&nbsp;once or twice to the Chinese view. The&nbsp;<br>effects of this strategy&nbsp;were exactly what&nbsp;the Chinese wanted. The men continued to&nbsp;<br>participate voluntarily in&nbsp;the contests&nbsp;because&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=80></a><i>Commitment and Consistency&nbsp;</i>72&nbsp;<br>
they saw that&nbsp;they could win with essays highly favorable to their own country. Perhaps&nbsp;<br>without realizing it, however,&nbsp;they began to shade their essays a bit toward communism&nbsp;<br>in order to have a better chance of winning. The Chinese were ready to pounce on any&nbsp;<br>concession to Communist dogma and to bring&nbsp;consistency pressures to bear upon it. In&nbsp;<br>the case of a written&nbsp;declaration&nbsp;within a voluntary essay,&nbsp;they&nbsp;had a perfect&nbsp;<br>commitment&nbsp;from&nbsp;which to build toward collaboration and conversion.&nbsp;<br>
Other compliance professionals also&nbsp;know&nbsp;about the committing power of written&nbsp;<br>statements. The enormously successful Amway&nbsp;Corporation, for instance, has a way to&nbsp;<br>spur their sales personnel to&nbsp;greater and greater accomplishments. Members of the staff&nbsp;<br>are asked to set individual&nbsp;sales&nbsp;goals and&nbsp;commit themselves to those goals&nbsp;by&nbsp;<br>personally recording them on paper:&nbsp;<br>
<i>One final tip before you get started: Set a goal and&nbsp;</i>write it down.&nbsp;<i>Whatever the goal,&nbsp;<br>the important thing is that you set it, so&nbsp;you've got something for which to aim</i>—<i>and&nbsp;<br>that you write it down. There is something magical about writing things down. So set a&nbsp;<br>goal and write it down. When you reach that&nbsp;goal, set another and write that down.&nbsp;<br>You'll be off and running.</i>&nbsp;<br>
If the Amway people have found &quot;something&nbsp;magical about writing things down,&quot; so&nbsp;<br>have other business organizations. Some&nbsp;door-to-door sales companies use the magic of&nbsp;<br>written commitments to battle the &quot;cooling-off'&nbsp;laws that exist in many states. The laws&nbsp;<br>are designed&nbsp;to allow customers a few days&nbsp;after agreeing to purchase an item&nbsp;to cancel&nbsp;<br>the sale and receive a full refund. At first this legislation&nbsp;hurt the hard-sell companies&nbsp;<br>deeply. Because they emphasize high-pressure&nbsp;tactics, their customers often buy, not&nbsp;<br>because they want the products but because they are duped or intimidated into the sale.&nbsp;<br>When the laws went into effect, these customers began canceling in droves.&nbsp;<br>
The companies have since learned&nbsp;a beautifully simple trick that cuts&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;<br>such cancellations drastically.&nbsp;They merely have the customer, rather than the&nbsp;<br>salesperson,&nbsp;fill out the sales agreement. According to the sales-training&nbsp;program&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>prominent encyclopedia company, that personal commitment alone has proved to be &quot;a&nbsp;<br>very important psychological aid in preventing customers from&nbsp;backing out of their&nbsp;<br>contracts.&quot; Like the Amway Corporation, these organizations&nbsp;have found that something&nbsp;<br>special happens when people put their commitments on paper: They live up to what&nbsp;<br>they have written down.&nbsp;<br>
Another common way for businesses to cash in&nbsp;on the &quot;magic&quot; of written declarations&nbsp;<br>occurs through the use of an innocent-looking promotional device. Before I began to&nbsp;<br>study weapons of social influence, I used to&nbsp;wonder why big companies such as Procter&nbsp;<br>&amp; Gamble and General Foods are always running those &quot;25-, 50-, or 100-words or less&quot;&nbsp;<br>testimonial contests. They all&nbsp;seem to be alike. A contestant is to&nbsp;compose a short&nbsp;<br>personal statement that begins with the words, &quot;I like the product because ...&quot; and goes&nbsp;<br>on to laud the features of whatever cake mix&nbsp;or floor wax happens to be at issue. The&nbsp;<br>company judges the entries and awards prizes&nbsp;to the winners. What puzzled me was&nbsp;<br>what the companies got&nbsp;out of the deal. Often&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=81></a>73&nbsp;<i>Chapter 3</i>&nbsp;<br>
the contest requires no&nbsp;purchase; anyone submitting an entry&nbsp;is&nbsp;eligible.&nbsp;Yet, the&nbsp;<br>companies appear to be willing to incur the costs&nbsp;of&nbsp;contest after contest.&nbsp;<br>
I am no longer puzzled. The purpose behind the testimonial contest—to get as many&nbsp;<br>people as possible to endorse&nbsp;a product—is&nbsp;the same&nbsp;as the&nbsp;purpose behind the political&nbsp;<br>essay contests: to get endorsements for Chinese communism. In both instances the&nbsp;<br>process is the same. Participants voluntarily write essays for attractive prizes that they&nbsp;<br>have only a small chance to win. They know that for an essay to&nbsp;have any chance of&nbsp;<br>winning at all, however, it must include praise&nbsp;for the product. So they&nbsp;search to find&nbsp;<br>praiseworthy features of the&nbsp;product, and they describe them&nbsp;in their essays. The result&nbsp;<br>is hundreds of POWs in Korea or hundreds&nbsp;of thousands of people in America who&nbsp;<br>testify in writing&nbsp;to&nbsp;the products'&nbsp;appeal and&nbsp;who, consequently, experience that magical&nbsp;<br>pull to believe what they&nbsp;have written.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>The Public Eye</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
One reason that written testaments are effective in bringing about genuine personal&nbsp;<br>change is that they can&nbsp;so easily be made public. The prisoner experience in Korea&nbsp;<br>showed the Chinese to be quite aware of an&nbsp;important psychological principle: Public&nbsp;<br>commitments tend to be lasting commitments.&nbsp;The Chinese constantly arranged to have&nbsp;<br>the pro-Communist statements of their captives seen by others. They were posted&nbsp;<br>around camp, read by the author to a prisoner discussion group, or&nbsp;even read on the&nbsp;<br>camp radio broadcast. As far as the Chinese&nbsp;were concerned, the more public the better.&nbsp;<br>Why?&nbsp;<br>
Whenever one takes a stand that is visible to&nbsp;others, there arises a drive to maintain that&nbsp;<br>stand in order to&nbsp;<i>look&nbsp;</i>like a consistent person (Tedeschi, Schlenker, &amp; Bonoma, 1971;&nbsp;<br>Schlenker et al., 1994). Remember that earlier in this chapter I described how desirable&nbsp;<br>good personal consistency is as a trait; how someone without it may be judged as fickle,&nbsp;<br>uncertain, pliant,&nbsp;scatterbrained, or unstable; how someone with&nbsp;it is viewed as rational,&nbsp;<br>assured, trustworthy, and sound. Given this context, it is hardly surprising that people&nbsp;<br>try to avoid the look of inconsistency. For&nbsp;appearances'&nbsp;sake, then, the more public a&nbsp;<br>stand, the more reluctant we will be to change it.&nbsp;<br>
An illustration of the way public commitments&nbsp;can lead to consistent further action was&nbsp;<br>provided in a famous experiment performed by two prominent social psychologists,&nbsp;<br>Morton Deutsch and Harold Gerard (1955). The basic procedure was to have college&nbsp;<br>students first estimate in their minds the length of lines they were shown. At this point,&nbsp;<br>one sample of the students had to commit themselves publicly to their initial judgments&nbsp;<br>by writing their estimates down, signing their names to them, and turning them&nbsp;in to the&nbsp;<br>experimenter. A second sample of students&nbsp;also&nbsp;committed themselves to their first&nbsp;<br>estimates, but they did so privately by writing them&nbsp;down on a Magic Writing Pad and&nbsp;<br>then erasing them&nbsp;by lifting the Magic Pad's&nbsp;plastic cover before&nbsp;anyone could see what&nbsp;<br>they had written. A third set of&nbsp;students did not commit themselves&nbsp;to their&nbsp;initial&nbsp;<br>estimates at all; they just kept&nbsp;the estimates in mind privately.&nbsp;<br>
In these ways, Deutsch and Gerard had cleverly arranged for some students to commit&nbsp;<br>themselves publicly, some&nbsp;privately, and&nbsp;some not at all, to their initial de-&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=82></a><i>Commitment and Consistency&nbsp;</i>74&nbsp;<br>
cisions. What Deutsch and Gerard wanted to&nbsp;find out was which of the three types of&nbsp;<br>students would be most&nbsp;inclined to stick&nbsp;with their first judgments after receiving&nbsp;<br>information that those&nbsp;judgments were incorrect.&nbsp;Therefore,&nbsp;all the students were given&nbsp;<br>new evidence suggesting that&nbsp;their initial estimates were wrong, and they were then&nbsp;<br>given the chance to change their estimates.&nbsp;<br>
The results&nbsp;were quite clear. The students who had never written down their first&nbsp;<br>choices were the least loyal to those choices. When new evidence was presented that&nbsp;<br>questioned the wisdom&nbsp;of decisions that had&nbsp;never left their heads, these students were&nbsp;<br>the most influenced by the new information&nbsp;to&nbsp;change what they had&nbsp;viewed as the&nbsp;<br>&quot;correct&quot; decision. Compared to these uncommitted students, those who had merely&nbsp;<br>written their decisions for a moment on a Magic Pad were significantly&nbsp;less willing&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>change their minds when given the chance.&nbsp;Even though they had committed&nbsp;<br>themselves under anonymous circumstances, the act of writing down their first&nbsp;<br>judgments caused them&nbsp;to resist the influence of contradictory new data and to remain&nbsp;<br>consistent with their preliminary choices. However, Deutsch and Gerard found I that, by&nbsp;<br>far, it was the students who had publicly&nbsp;recorded&nbsp;their initial positions who&nbsp;<br>
most resolutely refused to shift from those positions&nbsp;later.&nbsp;Public commitments had&nbsp;<br>hardened them&nbsp;into the&nbsp;most stubborn of all.&nbsp;<br>
This sort of stubbornness can occur even in situations in&nbsp;which accuracy should be more&nbsp;<br>important than consistency. In one study, when&nbsp;6- or 12-person experimental juries&nbsp;<br>were deciding a close case, hung juries were&nbsp;significantly more frequent if the jurors&nbsp;<br>had to express their opinions with a visible show&nbsp;of hands rather than by&nbsp;secret ballot.&nbsp;<br>Once jurors&nbsp;had stated&nbsp;their initial views&nbsp;publicly, they&nbsp;were reluctant to allow&nbsp;<br>themselves to change publicly. Should you ever find yourself as the foreper-son of a&nbsp;<br>jury under these conditions, you could reduce the risk of a hung jury by choosing a&nbsp;<br>secret rather than public balloting technique (Kerr &amp; MacCoun, 1985).&nbsp;<br>
The Deutsch and Gerard finding that we are truest to our decisions&nbsp;if we have bound&nbsp;<br>ourselves to them&nbsp;publicly can be put to good&nbsp;use. Consider the organizations dedicated&nbsp;<br>to helping people rid themselves of bad&nbsp;habits. Many weight-reduction clinics, for&nbsp;<br>instance, understand that often a person's private decision to lose weight will be too&nbsp;<br>weak to withstand the blandishments of bakery windows, wafting&nbsp;cooking scents, and&nbsp;<br>late-night&nbsp;Sara Lee commercials. So they see to it that&nbsp;the decision is buttressed by the&nbsp;<br>pillars of&nbsp;public commitment. They require&nbsp;their clients to write down an immediate&nbsp;<br>weight-loss goal and&nbsp;<i>show&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>that goal to as many friends, relatives, and neighbors as&nbsp;<br>possible. Clinic operators report that frequently this simple technique works where all&nbsp;<br>else has failed.&nbsp;<br>
Of course, there's no need to pay a special&nbsp;clinic in order to engage a visible&nbsp;<br>commitment&nbsp;as any ally. One San Diego woman described to me&nbsp;how she employed a&nbsp;<br>public promise to help herself finally stop smoking:&nbsp;<br>
/&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>remember it was after I heard about another scientific study showing that smoking&nbsp;<br>causes cancer. Every time one of&nbsp;those things came out, I used&nbsp;to get determined to quit,&nbsp;<br>but I never could. This time, though, I decided I had to do</i>&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=83></a>75&nbsp;<i>Chapter 3</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>something. I'm a proud person. It matters to me&nbsp;if other people see me in a bad light. So&nbsp;<br>I thought, &quot;Maybe I can me that pride to&nbsp;help me dump this damn habit.&quot; So I made a&nbsp;<br>list of all the people who 1 really wanted to&nbsp;respect me. Then I went out and got some&nbsp;<br>blank business cards and I wrote on the back of each card, &quot;I&nbsp;promise you that I will&nbsp;<br>never smoke another cigarette.&quot;</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>Within a week, I had given or sent a signed card to everybody on my list</i>—<i>my dad, my&nbsp;<br>brother back East, my boss, my best girlfriend, my ex-husband, everybody but one</i>—<i>the&nbsp;<br>guy I was dating then. I was just crazy about&nbsp;him, and I really wanted him to value me&nbsp;<br>as a person.&nbsp;Believe me,&nbsp;I thought twice about giving him a&nbsp;card&nbsp;because I knew that&nbsp;if I&nbsp;<br>couldn't keep my promise to him I'd die.

<b>READER'S&nbsp;REPORT 3.1</b>&nbsp;<br>
<b>From a Canadian University Professor</b>&nbsp;<br>
I just read a newspaper article on how a restaurant owner used&nbsp;public commitments to&nbsp;<br>solve a big problem&nbsp;of customers who didn't show-up for their table reservations. I don't&nbsp;<br>know if he&nbsp;read your book or not first, but he&nbsp;did something that fits perfectly with the&nbsp;<br>commitment/consistency&nbsp;principle you talk about. He told his receptionists to stop&nbsp;<br>saying, &quot;Please call us if you change your plans,&quot; and to start asking, &quot;Will you please&nbsp;<br>call us if you change your plans?&quot; and to&nbsp;wait for a response. His no-show rate&nbsp;<br>immediately dropped from 30 percent to 10 percent.&nbsp;<br>
<i>Author's note: What was it about this subtle shift that led to such&nbsp;a dramatic difference?&nbsp;<br>For me, it was the receptionist's request for (and pause for) the caller's promise. By&nbsp;<br>spurring patrons to make a public commitment,&nbsp;this approach increased the chance that&nbsp;<br>they would follow through on it. By the way,&nbsp;the canny proprietor was Gordon Sinclair&nbsp;<br>of Gordon's restaurant in Chicago.</i>&nbsp;<br>
2This public commitment tactic may work&nbsp;especially well for individuals with high&nbsp;<br>levels of pride or public&nbsp;self-consciousness (Feingstein,&nbsp;Scheier, &amp; Buss, 1975). For&nbsp;<br>example, it worked successfully for Charles DeGaulle, whose remarkable achievements&nbsp;<br>for France were said to be matched only by his ego. When asked to explain why&nbsp;<br>announcing to everyone that he would stop&nbsp;his heavy smoking obliged him&nbsp;to quit&nbsp;<br>forever, he is reported to&nbsp;have replied gravely, &quot;DeGaulle cannot go back on his word&quot;&nbsp;<br>(Quoted in D. Cook, 1984).&nbsp;<br>

<i><b>The Effort Extra</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
The evidence is clear that the more effort that goes into a commitment, the greater is&nbsp;its&nbsp;<br>ability to influence&nbsp;the&nbsp;attitudes&nbsp;of&nbsp;the person who made it. We can&nbsp;find&nbsp;that evidence&nbsp;<br>quite nearby or as far away as the&nbsp;back regions of the primitive world.&nbsp;<br>
Let's begin close to home with the entertainment section of tomorrow's newspaper,&nbsp;<br>where an important piece of information is missing from&nbsp;ads for popular music&nbsp;<br>concerts—the price. Why should it be that&nbsp;concert promoters are increasingly hiding the&nbsp;<br>cost of admission from&nbsp;fans?&nbsp;Perhaps they're&nbsp;afraid that their ever-higher prices will&nbsp;<br>scare ticket buyers away. But, interested fans will find out the&nbsp;price of a seat as soon as&nbsp;<br>they call or visit a&nbsp;ticket outlet, right? True, but promoters have recognized that&nbsp;<br>potential concertgoers are more likely to buy tickets&nbsp;<i>after&nbsp;</i>that call or&nbsp;visit than before.&nbsp;<br>Even phoning to inquire about ticket prices&nbsp;constitutes an&nbsp;initial commitment to the&nbsp;<br>concert. Combine that with the time and effort expended waiting interminably on hold&nbsp;<br>after speed-redialing through jammed phone&nbsp;lines, and the promoters have fans&nbsp;<br>precisely where they want them&nbsp;once the cost&nbsp;is revealed—at the end of an active,&nbsp;<br>public, effortful commitment to the event.&nbsp;<br>
More far-flung illustrations of&nbsp;the power of&nbsp;effortful commitments exist, as well. There&nbsp;<br>is a tribe in southern Africa, the Thonga, that requires each of its boys to go through an&nbsp;<br>elaborate initiation ceremony before he can be counted a man of the tribe. As with boys&nbsp;<br>in many other primitive tribes, a Thonga boy endures a great deal before he is admitted&nbsp;<br>to adult membership in&nbsp;the group. Anthropologists Whiting, Kluckhohn, and Anthony&nbsp;<br>(1958) have described this three-month ordeal in brief but vivid terms:&nbsp;<br>
<i>When a boy is somewhere between 10 and 16 years of age, he is sent by his parents to&nbsp;<br>&quot;circumcision school,&quot; which is held every 4&nbsp;or&nbsp;5&nbsp;years. Here in company with his age-<br>mates he undergoes severe hazing&nbsp;by the adult males of the society.&nbsp;The initiation&nbsp;<br>begins when each boy runs&nbsp;the gauntlet between&nbsp;two rows&nbsp;of men who beat him with&nbsp;<br>clubs. At&nbsp;the end of this experience he is stripped of&nbsp;his clothes and his hair is cut. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;<br>next met by a man covered with lion manes and is seated upon a stone facing this &quot;lion&nbsp;<br>man.&quot; Someone then strikes him from behind&nbsp;and when he turns his&nbsp;head to see who has&nbsp;<br>struck him, his foreskin is seized and in&nbsp;two movements cut off by the &quot;lion man.&quot;&nbsp;<br>Afterward he is secluded for three months in the &quot;yard of mysteries,&quot; where he can be&nbsp;<br>seen only by&nbsp;the initiated.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>During the course of his initiation, the&nbsp;boy undergoes six major trials: beatings,&nbsp;<br>exposure to cold, thirst, eating of unsavory&nbsp;foods, punishment, and the threat of death.&nbsp;<br>On the slightest pretext, he may be&nbsp;beaten&nbsp;by one of the newly initiated men, who is&nbsp;<br>assigned to the task by the older men of&nbsp;the tribe. He sleeps without covering and&nbsp;<br>suffers bitterly from the winter cold. He is&nbsp;forbidden to drink a drop of water during the&nbsp;<br>whole three months. Meals are often made&nbsp;nauseating by the half-digested grass from&nbsp;<br>the stomach of an antelope, which is&nbsp;poured over his food. If he is caught</i>&nbsp;<br>

<i>breaking any important rule governing the&nbsp;ceremony, he is severely punished. For&nbsp;<br>example, in one of these punishments, sticks are placed between the fingers of the&nbsp;<br>offender, then a strong man closes his hand around that of&nbsp;the novice, practically&nbsp;<br>crushing his fingers. He is frightened into submission by being told that&nbsp;informer times&nbsp;<br>boys who had tried to escape or who had revealed the secrets to women or to the&nbsp;<br>uninitiated were hanged and their bodies burned to ashes, (p. 360)</i>&nbsp;<br>
On the face of it, these rites&nbsp;seem&nbsp;extraordinary and bizarre. Yet, at the same time, they&nbsp;<br>are remarkably similar&nbsp;in principle and even in detail to the common initiation&nbsp;<br>ceremonies of school fraternities. During the&nbsp;traditional &quot;Hell Week&quot; held yearly on&nbsp;<br>college campuses, fraternity&nbsp;pledges must&nbsp;persevere through a variety of&nbsp;activities&nbsp;<br>designed by the older members&nbsp;to&nbsp;test&nbsp;the&nbsp;limits of&nbsp;physical exertion, psychological&nbsp;<br>strain, and social embarrassment. At week's&nbsp;end, the boys who have persisted through&nbsp;<br>the ordeal are accepted for full group membership. Mostly&nbsp;their tribulations have&nbsp;left&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;no more than greatly tired and a&nbsp;bit shaky, although sometimes&nbsp;the negative&nbsp;<br>effects are more serious.&nbsp;<br>
What is interesting is how closely the particular&nbsp;features of Hell Week tasks match those&nbsp;<br>of&nbsp;tribal initiation rites.&nbsp;Recall that anthropologists identified six major trials to be&nbsp;<br>endured by a Thonga initiate during his stay&nbsp;in the &quot;yard of mysteries.&quot; A scan of&nbsp;<br>newspaper reports shows that each trial also has its place in&nbsp;the hazing rituals of Greek-<br>letter societies:&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Beatings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Fourteen-year-old Michael&nbsp;Kalogris spent three weeks in a Long Island&nbsp;<br>hospital recovering from&nbsp;internal&nbsp;injuries&nbsp;suffered during a Hell Night initiation&nbsp;<br>ceremony of his high-school fraternity, Omega Gamma Delta. He had been&nbsp;<br>administered the &quot;atomic bomb&quot; by his prospective brothers, who told him&nbsp;to hold his&nbsp;<br>hands over his head and keep them there while they gathered around to slam&nbsp;fists into&nbsp;<br>his stomach and back simultaneously and repeatedly.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Exposure to cold.&nbsp;</i>On a winter night, Frederick Bronner, a California junior college&nbsp;<br>student, was taken 3,000 feet up and 10 miles into the hills of a national forest by his&nbsp;<br>prospective fraternity brothers. Left to&nbsp;find his way home&nbsp;wearing only a thin sweat&nbsp;<br>shirt and slacks, Fat Freddy, as he was called,&nbsp;shivered in a frigid wind until he tumbled&nbsp;<br>down a steep ravine, fracturing bones and hurting his head. Prevented by his injuries&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;going on, he huddled there against the cold until he died&nbsp;of exposure.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Thirst.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Two Ohio State University freshmen found themselves in the &quot;dungeon&quot; of&nbsp;<br>their prospective&nbsp;fraternity house after&nbsp;breaking&nbsp;the&nbsp;rule requiring&nbsp;all pledges to crawl&nbsp;<br>into the dining area prior to Hell Week meals. Once locked in the house storage closet,&nbsp;<br>they were given only salty foods to eat for nearly two days. Nothing was provided for&nbsp;<br>drinking purposes except a pair of&nbsp;plastic&nbsp;cups in&nbsp;which they could catch&nbsp;their own&nbsp;<br>urine.&nbsp;<br>

<i>• Eating of unsavory foods.&nbsp;</i>At Kappa Sigma house on the campus of the University of&nbsp;<br>Southern California, the eyes of eleven&nbsp;pledges bulged when they saw the sickening&nbsp;<br>task before them. Eleven quarter-pound slabs of raw liver lay on&nbsp;a tray. Thick cut and&nbsp;<br>soaked in oil, each was to be&nbsp;swallowed&nbsp;whole, one to a boy. Gagging&nbsp;and choking&nbsp;<br>repeatedly, young Richard Swanson failed three times to down&nbsp;his piece. Determined to&nbsp;<br>succeed, he finally got the oil-soaked meat into his throat where it lodged and, despite&nbsp;<br>all efforts to&nbsp;remove it, killed him.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;<i>Punishment.&nbsp;</i>In Wisconsin, a pledge who forgot one&nbsp;section of a&nbsp;ritual incantation to&nbsp;<br>be memorized by all initiates was punished for his error. He&nbsp;was required to keep his&nbsp;<br>feet under the rear legs&nbsp;of a folding chair while the heaviest&nbsp;of his fraternity brothers sat&nbsp;<br>down and drank a beer. Although the pledge&nbsp;did not cry out during the punishment, a&nbsp;<br>bone in each&nbsp;of his feet was broken.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Threats of death.&nbsp;</i>A pledge of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity was taken to a beach area of&nbsp;<br>New Jersey and told to dig his &quot;own grave.&quot; Seconds after he complied with orders to&nbsp;<br>lie flat&nbsp;in&nbsp;the finished hole, the sides collapsed, suffocating him&nbsp;before his prospective&nbsp;<br>fraternity brothers could dig him&nbsp;out.&nbsp;<br>
There is another striking&nbsp;similarity&nbsp;between the initiation rites of&nbsp;tribal and fraternal&nbsp;<br>societies: They simply will not die. Resisting all attempts to eliminate or suppress them,&nbsp;<br>such hazing&nbsp;practices&nbsp;have been phenomenally resilient. Authorities,&nbsp;in the form&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>colonial governments or university administrations, have tried&nbsp;threats,&nbsp;social pressures,&nbsp;<br>legal actions, banishments, bribes, and bans to persuade groups to remove the hazards&nbsp;<br>and humiliations from&nbsp;their initiation&nbsp;ceremonies. None has been successful. Oh, there&nbsp;<br>may be a change while the authority is watching closely, but this&nbsp;is usually&nbsp;more&nbsp;<br>apparent than real—the harsher trials occurring under more secret circumstances until&nbsp;<br>the pressure is off when they can surface again.&nbsp;<br>
On some college campuses, officials have tried to eliminate dangerous hazing practices&nbsp;<br>by substituting a &quot;Help Week&quot; of civic service or by taking direct control of the&nbsp;<br>initiation rituals. When such attempts are not slyly circumvented by fraternities, they are&nbsp;<br>met with outright&nbsp;physical resistance. For example, in the aftermath of&nbsp;Richard&nbsp;<br>Swanson's choking death at USC, the university president issued&nbsp;new rules requiring&nbsp;<br>that all pledging activities be reviewed by school authorities before going into effect and&nbsp;<br>that adult advisers be present during&nbsp;initiation ceremonies. According to one national&nbsp;<br>magazine, &quot;the new 'code'&nbsp;set off a riot so&nbsp;violent that city police and fire detachments&nbsp;<br>were afraid to enter campus.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Resigning themselves to the inevitable, other college representatives have given up on&nbsp;<br>the possibility of abolishing the degradations&nbsp;of&nbsp;Hell Week. &quot;If&nbsp;hazing&nbsp;is a universal&nbsp;<br>human activity, and every bit of evidence points to this conclusion, you most likely&nbsp;<br>won't be able to ban it effectively. Refuse&nbsp;to allow it openly and&nbsp;it will go underground.&nbsp;<br>You can't&nbsp;ban sex, you can't&nbsp;prohibit alcohol, and you probably can't&nbsp;eliminate hazing!&quot;&nbsp;<br>(Gordon &amp; Gordon, 1963).&nbsp;<br>
What is it about hazing practices that make&nbsp;them so precious to these societies?&nbsp;What&nbsp;<br>could make the groups want to evade, undermine, or contest any effort to ban&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=88></a><i>Commitment and Consistency&nbsp;</i>80&nbsp;<br>
the degrading and perilous features of&nbsp;their initiation rights? Some&nbsp;have argued that the&nbsp;<br>groups themselves are composed of psychological or social miscreants whose twisted&nbsp;<br>needs demand that others be harmed and humiliated. The evidence, however, does&nbsp;not&nbsp;<br>support such a view. Studies done on the personality traits of fraternity members, for&nbsp;<br>instance, show them&nbsp;to be, if&nbsp;anything, slightly healthier than other college students in&nbsp;<br>their psychological adjustment (for a review, see C. S. Johnson, 1972). Similarly,&nbsp;<br>fraternities are known for their willingness to&nbsp;engage in beneficial community projects&nbsp;<br>for the general social good. What they are not&nbsp;willing to do, however,&nbsp;is substitute these&nbsp;<br>projects for their initiation ceremonies. One&nbsp;survey at the&nbsp;University of&nbsp;Washington&nbsp;<br>(Walker, 1967) found that, of the fraternity chapters examined, most had a type of Help&nbsp;<br>Week tradition but that this community service was&nbsp;<i>in addition&nbsp;</i>to Hell Week. In only&nbsp;<br>one case was such service directly related to initiation procedures.&nbsp;<br>
The picture that emerges of the perpetrators&nbsp;of hazing practices is&nbsp;of normal individuals&nbsp;<br>who tend to be psychologically stable and socially concerned but who become&nbsp;<br>aberrantly&nbsp;harsh as a group at only one&nbsp;time—immediately before the admission of new&nbsp;<br>members to the society. The evidence, then, points to the ceremony as the culprit. There&nbsp;<br>must be something about its rigors that&nbsp;is vital to the group.&nbsp;There must be some&nbsp;<br>function to its harshness that the society will fight relentlessly&nbsp;to maintain.&nbsp;What?&nbsp;<br>
My own view is that the answer appeared in&nbsp;1959 in the results of&nbsp;a study little known&nbsp;<br>outside of social psychology. A pair of&nbsp;young researchers, Elliot Aronson and Judson&nbsp;<br>Mills, decided to test their observation that&nbsp;&quot;persons who go through a great deal of&nbsp;<br>trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more&nbsp;highly than persons who attain&nbsp;<br>the same thing with a minimum&nbsp;of&nbsp;effort.&quot; The real stroke of&nbsp;inspiration came in their&nbsp;<br>choice of the initiation ceremony as the best place to examine this possibility. They&nbsp;<br>found that college women who had to endure a severely embarrassing initiation&nbsp;<br>ceremony in order to gain access to&nbsp;a sex discussion group convinced themselves that&nbsp;<br>their new group and its discussions were extremely valuable, even though Aronson and&nbsp;<br>Mills had rehearsed the other&nbsp;group members to be as &quot;worthless and uninteresting&quot; as&nbsp;<br>possible. Different coeds who&nbsp;went through a much milder&nbsp;initiation ceremony or went&nbsp;<br>through no initiation at all, were decidedly less positive about the &quot;worthless&quot; new&nbsp;<br>group they had joined. Additional research showed the same&nbsp;results when coeds&nbsp;were&nbsp;<br>required to endure pain rather than embarrassment to get into a group (Gerard &amp;&nbsp;<br>Mathewson,&nbsp;1966). The more electric shock a&nbsp;woman received as part of&nbsp;the initiation&nbsp;<br>ceremony, the more she later persuaded herself that her new group and its activities&nbsp;<br>were interesting, intelligent, and desirable.&nbsp;<br>
Now the harassments, the exertions, even the beatings of initiation rituals begin to make&nbsp;<br>sense. The Thonga tribesman with tears in&nbsp;his eyes, watching his 10-year-old son&nbsp;<br>tremble through a night on the cold ground of&nbsp;the &quot;yard of mysteries,&quot; the college&nbsp;<br>sophomore punctuating his Hell Night paddling of&nbsp;his fraternity &quot;little brother&quot; with&nbsp;<br>bursts of nervous laughter, these are not acts&nbsp;of sadism. They are acts of group survival.&nbsp;<br>They function, oddly enough, to spur future society members to find the&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<a name=89></a>81&nbsp;<i>Chapter 3</i>&nbsp;<br>
group more&nbsp;attractive and worthwhile. As long&nbsp;as it is the case that people like and&nbsp;<br>believe in what they have struggled to&nbsp;get, these groups will continue to arrange&nbsp;<br>effortful and troublesome&nbsp;initiation rites.&nbsp;The loyalty and dedication of those who&nbsp;<br>emerge will increase to a&nbsp;great degree the chances of group cohesiveness and survival.&nbsp;<br>Indeed, one study of 54 tribal cultures found that those with the most dramatic and&nbsp;<br>stringent initiation ceremonies were those with the&nbsp;greatest group solidarity (Young,&nbsp;<br>1965). Given Aronson and Mills'&nbsp;demonstration that the severity of an initiation&nbsp;<br>ceremony significantly heightens the newcomer's&nbsp;<i>commitment&nbsp;</i>to the group,&nbsp;it is hardly&nbsp;<br>surprising that groups will oppose all attempts&nbsp;to eliminate this crucial link to their&nbsp;<br>future strength.&nbsp;<br>
Military groups and organizations are by no means exempt from&nbsp;these same&nbsp;processes.&nbsp;<br>The agonies of &quot;boot camp&quot; initiations to&nbsp;the armed services are legendary and&nbsp;<br>effective. The novelist William&nbsp;Styron testified&nbsp;to this effectiveness after recounting the&nbsp;<br>misery of his own U.S. Marine concentration-camp-like &quot;training nightmare:&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<i>There is no ex-Marine of my acquaintance .&nbsp;. . who does&nbsp;not view the training as a&nbsp;<br>crucible out of which he emerged in some&nbsp;way more resilient, simply braver and better&nbsp;<br>for the wear (Styron, 1977, p. 3).</i>&nbsp;<br>
Although the rigors of basic training&nbsp;are widely approved by&nbsp;military brass, a policy of&nbsp;<br>&quot;zero tolerance&quot; is said&nbsp;to exist for incidents of aberrantly harsh hazing like those&nbsp;<br>contained in two videotapes uncovered by TV&nbsp;news sources in 1997. The tapes depicted&nbsp;<br>the practice of &quot;blood pinning,&quot; in which marine paratroopers who have completed 10&nbsp;<br>training jumps receive&nbsp;their golden wing pins.&nbsp;The pins, each with a pair of half-inch&nbsp;<br>points protruding from the back, are affixed to an initiate's shirt and then ground,&nbsp;<br>punched, slammed, and slapped into his chest&nbsp;while he writhes and screams (Gleick,&nbsp;<br>1997). Despite claims of outrage and&nbsp;disgust from military leaders in the aftermath, only&nbsp;<br>one of the 30 marines caught perpetrating the pain was recommended for discharge. A&nbsp;<br>few were assigned to receive counseling,&nbsp;while the participation&nbsp;of most (20) was&nbsp;<br>simply ignored. Official pronouncements of &quot;zero tolerance&quot; notwithstanding, I find it&nbsp;<br>instructive that the slaps delivered to the initiates were thunderous and to the heart. But,&nbsp;<br>to the initiators, they were light and to the wrist. Once again, it appears that, for groups&nbsp;<br>concerned about fostering a lasting sense of&nbsp;solidarity and distinction, the hardship of&nbsp;<br>demanding initiation activities will not be easily undermined.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>The Inner Choice</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Examination of such diverse activities as&nbsp;the indoctrination practices of the Chinese&nbsp;<br>Communists&nbsp;and the initiation rituals of&nbsp;college fraternities provides some valuable&nbsp;<br>information about commitment. It appears&nbsp;that the commitments&nbsp;most effective in&nbsp;<br>changing a person's self-image and future behavior&nbsp;are those that are active, public, and&nbsp;<br>
<i>&nbsp;</i><br>
<i>&nbsp;</i><br>

effortful. However, there is another property of&nbsp;effective commitment more important&nbsp;<br>than the other three combined. To understand what&nbsp;it is, we first need to solve a pair of&nbsp;<br>puzzles in the actions of Communist interrogators and college fraternity brothers.&nbsp;<br>
The first puzzle comes from&nbsp;the refusal of&nbsp;fraternity chapters to allow public-service&nbsp;<br>activities to be part of their initiation ceremonies. Recall&nbsp;Walker's survey (1967), which&nbsp;<br>reported that community projects, though frequent, were nearly always separated from&nbsp;<br>the membership-induction program. Why?&nbsp;If&nbsp;an effortful commitment is what&nbsp;<br>fraternities are after in&nbsp;their initiation rites,&nbsp;surely&nbsp;they could structure enough&nbsp;<br>distasteful and strenuous civic activities for their pledges; there is plenty of exertion and&nbsp;<br>unpleasantness to be found in the world of&nbsp;old-age-home repairs, mental-health-center&nbsp;<br>yard work, and hospital bedpan duty. Besides,&nbsp;community-spirited&nbsp;endeavors of this&nbsp;<br>sort would do much to improve the highly&nbsp;unfavorable public&nbsp;and media image of&nbsp;<br>fraternity Hell Week rites; a survey (Phalen, 1951) showed that for every positive&nbsp;<br>newspaper story concerning Hell Week, there were five negative stories. If&nbsp;only&nbsp;for&nbsp;<br>public-relations reasons, then, fraternities&nbsp;should want to incorporate community-<br>service efforts into their initiation practices. But they don't.&nbsp;<br>
To examine the second puzzle, we need to return to the Chinese prison camps of Korea&nbsp;<br>and the political essay contests held for American captives. The Chinese wanted as&nbsp;<br>many Americans as possible to enter these contests so that, in the process, they might&nbsp;<br>write comments favorable to the Communist view. If, however, the idea&nbsp;was to attract&nbsp;<br>large numbers of entrants, why were the prizes so small? A few extra cigarettes or a&nbsp;<br>little fresh fruit were often all that a contest winner could&nbsp;expect. In the setting, even&nbsp;<br>these prizes were valuable, but,&nbsp;still,&nbsp;there were&nbsp;much larger&nbsp;rewards—warm&nbsp;clothing,&nbsp;<br>special mail privileges,&nbsp;increased freedom&nbsp;of movement in&nbsp;camp—that the Chinese&nbsp;<br>could have used to increase the number of essay writers.&nbsp;Yet they&nbsp;specifically chose to&nbsp;<br>employ the smaller rather&nbsp;than the larger, more motivating rewards.&nbsp;<br>
Although the settings are quite different, the surveyed fraternities refused to allow civic&nbsp;<br>activities into their initiation ceremonies for the same&nbsp;reason that the Chinese withheld&nbsp;<br>large prizes in favor of less powerful inducements: They&nbsp;wanted the participants to&nbsp;<i>own&nbsp;<br></i>what they had done. No excuses, no ways&nbsp;out were allowed. A pledge who suffered&nbsp;<br>through an arduous hazing could&nbsp;not be given the chance to believe he did so for&nbsp;<br>charitable purposes. A prisoner who salted his political essay with ami-American&nbsp;<br>comments could not be permitted to&nbsp;shrug it off&nbsp;as motivated by a big reward. No, the&nbsp;<br>fraternity chapters&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chinese Communists were playing for keeps.&nbsp;It was not enough&nbsp;<br>to wring commitments out of their men; those men had to be made to take inner&nbsp;<br>responsibility for their actions.&nbsp;<br>
Given the Chinese Communist government's&nbsp;affinity for the political essay contest as a&nbsp;<br>commitment&nbsp;device, it should come as no surprise&nbsp;that a wave of such contests appeared&nbsp;<br>in the aftermath of the&nbsp;1989 massacre in&nbsp;Tiannanmen Square,&nbsp;where pro-democracy&nbsp;<br>protesters were gunned down by government soldiers. In Beijing alone, nine state-run&nbsp;<br>newspapers and television&nbsp;stations sponsored essay competitions on the &quot;quelling of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>counterrevolutionary rebellion.&quot; Still acting in accord&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<a name=91></a>83&nbsp;<i>Chapter 3</i>&nbsp;<br>
with its long-standing and insightful de-emphasis of rewards for public commitments,&nbsp;<br>the Beijing government left the contest prizes unspecified.&nbsp;<br>
Social scientists have determined that&nbsp;<i>we accept inner responsibility for a behavior&nbsp;<br>when we think we have chosen to perform&nbsp;it in the absence of strong outside pressure.&nbsp;</i>A&nbsp;<br>large&nbsp;reward&nbsp;is&nbsp;one such external pressure.&nbsp;It may get us to perform&nbsp;certain actions, but&nbsp;<br>it won't get us to accept inner responsibility for the acts.3&nbsp;Consequently, we won't feel&nbsp;<br>committed to them. The same is true of&nbsp;a strong threat; it may motivate immediate&nbsp;<br>compliance, but it is unlikely to produce long-term&nbsp;commitment. All this has important&nbsp;<br>implications for rearing children. It suggests that we should never heavily bribe or&nbsp;<br>threaten our&nbsp;children to do the things we want&nbsp;them truly to believe in. Such pressures&nbsp;<br>will probably produce temporary compliance with our wishes. However, if we want&nbsp;<br>more than just that, if&nbsp;we want our children to&nbsp;believe in the correctness of&nbsp;what they&nbsp;<br>have done, if we want them&nbsp;to continue to&nbsp;perform&nbsp;the desired behavior when we are&nbsp;<br>not present to apply those outside pressures, then we must somehow arrange for them&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>accept inner responsibility for the actions we&nbsp;want them&nbsp;to take. An experiment by&nbsp;<br>Jonathan Freedman (1965) gives us some&nbsp;hints about what to do and what not to do in&nbsp;<br>this regard.&nbsp;<br>
Freedman wanted to see if he could prevent second-to-fourth-grade&nbsp;boys from&nbsp;playing&nbsp;<br>with a fascinating toy, just because he had&nbsp;said&nbsp;that it was wrong to do so some six&nbsp;<br>weeks earlier. Anyone familiar with seven-&nbsp;to nine-year-old boys&nbsp;must realize the&nbsp;<br>enormity of the task, but Freedman had a plan. If he could first get the boys to convince&nbsp;<br>themselves that it was wrong to play with the forbidden toy, perhaps that belief would&nbsp;<br>keep them&nbsp;from&nbsp;playing with&nbsp;it thereafter. The difficulty&nbsp;was making the boys believe&nbsp;<br>that it was wrong to amuse themselves with the toy—an extremely expensive, battery-<br>controlled robot.&nbsp;<br>
Freedman knew it would be easy enough to have a boy obey temporarily. All he had to&nbsp;<br>do was threaten the boy with&nbsp;severe consequences should he&nbsp;be caught playing with the&nbsp;<br>toy. As long as he was nearby to deal out&nbsp;stiff punishment, Freedman figured that few&nbsp;<br>boys would risk operating the robot. He was&nbsp;right. After showing a boy an array of five&nbsp;<br>toys and warning him, &quot;It is wrong to play with the robot. If you play with the robot, I'll&nbsp;<br>be very angry and will have to do something about it,&quot; Freedman left the room&nbsp;for a few&nbsp;<br>minutes. During that time, the boy was observed secretly through a one-way mirror.&nbsp;<br>Freedman tried this threat procedure on 22 different boys, and 21 of them never touched&nbsp;<br>the robot while he was gone.&nbsp;<br>
So a strong threat was successful while the boys thought&nbsp;they might be caught and&nbsp;<br>punished. Of course, Freedman had already guessed&nbsp;that. He was really interested in the&nbsp;<br>effectiveness of the threat in guiding the boys'&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;later on, when he was no longer&nbsp;<br>around. To find out what would happen then, he sent a young&nbsp;<br>
sin fact large material rewards may even reduce or &quot;undermine&quot; our&nbsp;inner responsibility&nbsp;<br>for an act, causing a subsequent reluctance&nbsp;to&nbsp;perform&nbsp;it when the&nbsp;reward&nbsp;is no&nbsp;longer&nbsp;<br>present (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985; Higgins, Lee,&nbsp;Kwon, &amp; Trope, 1995; Lepper &amp; Greene,&nbsp;<br>1978).&nbsp;<br>

woman back to the boys'&nbsp;school about six weeks after he had been there. She took the&nbsp;<br>boys out of the class one at a time&nbsp;to participate in an experiment. Without ever&nbsp;<br>mentioning any connection with Freedman, she escorted each boy back to the room&nbsp;<br>containing the five toys and gave him&nbsp;a drawing test. While&nbsp;she was scoring the test, she&nbsp;<br>told the boy&nbsp;that he was free to play with any toy in the room. Of course, almost all of&nbsp;<br>the boys played with a toy. The interesting result was that, of the boys who played with&nbsp;<br>a toy, 77 percent chose to play&nbsp;with the robot that had been&nbsp;forbidden to them&nbsp;earlier.&nbsp;<br>Freedman's severe threat, which had been so&nbsp;successful six weeks before, was almost&nbsp;<br>totally unsuccessful when he was no longer able to back it up with punishment.&nbsp;<br>
However, Freedman wasn't&nbsp;finished yet. He&nbsp;changed his procedure slightly with a&nbsp;<br>second sample of boys. These boys, too, were initially shown the array of five toys by&nbsp;<br>Freedman and warned not to play with the robot while he&nbsp;was briefly out of the room&nbsp;<br>because &quot;It is wrong to play with the robot.&quot;&nbsp;This time, Freedman provided no strong&nbsp;<br>threat to frighten a boy into obedience. He&nbsp;simply left&nbsp;the room&nbsp;and observed through&nbsp;<br>the one-way&nbsp;mirror to see if his instruction&nbsp;against playing with the forbidden toy was&nbsp;<br>enough. It was. Just as with&nbsp;the other sample, only 1 of&nbsp;the 22 boys touched the robot&nbsp;<br>during the short time&nbsp;Freedman was&nbsp;gone.&nbsp;<br>
The real difference between the two samples of boys came&nbsp;six weeks later, when they&nbsp;<br>had a chance to play&nbsp;with the toys while Freedman was no longer around. An&nbsp;<br>astonishing thing happened with the boys who earlier had&nbsp;been given no strong threat&nbsp;<br>against playing with the robot: When given&nbsp;the freedom to play with any toy they&nbsp;<br>wished, most avoided the robot, even though it&nbsp;was by far the most attractive of the five&nbsp;<br>toys available (the others were a cheap plastic submarine,&nbsp;a child's baseball glove&nbsp;<br>without a ball, an unloaded toy rifle, and a&nbsp;toy tractor). When these boys played with&nbsp;<br>one of the five toys, only&nbsp;33 percent chose the robot.&nbsp;<br>
Something dramatic had happened to both groups of boys. For the first group, it was the&nbsp;<br>severe threat they heard from&nbsp;Freedman to&nbsp;back up his statement that playing with the&nbsp;<br>robot was &quot;wrong.&quot; It had been quite effective, while Freedman could catch them&nbsp;<br>violating his rule. Later, though, when he was no longer present to observe the boys'&nbsp;<br>behavior, his threat was impotent and his rule&nbsp;was, consequently, ignored. It seems clear&nbsp;<br>that the threat had not taught the boys that operating the robot was wrong, only that it&nbsp;<br>was unwise to do so when the possibility of punishment existed.&nbsp;<br>
For the other boys, the dramatic event had come&nbsp;from&nbsp;inside, not outside. Freedman had&nbsp;<br>instructed them, too, that playing with the robot was wrong,&nbsp;but he had added no threat&nbsp;<br>of punishment should they disobey him. There were two important results. First,&nbsp;<br>Freedman's instruction alone was enough to&nbsp;prevent the boys from&nbsp;operating the robot&nbsp;<br>while he was briefly out of the room. Second, the boys took personal responsibility for&nbsp;<br>their choices to stay away from&nbsp;the robot during that time. They decided that they hadn't&nbsp;<br>played with it because&nbsp;<i>they&nbsp;</i>didn't want to. After all, there were no strong punishments&nbsp;<br>associated with the toy&nbsp;to explain their behavior otherwise. Thus, weeks later, when&nbsp;<br>Freedman was nowhere around,&nbsp;they still ignored the&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

robot because they had been changed inside to&nbsp;believe&nbsp;that they did not want to play&nbsp;<br>with it.&nbsp;<br>
Adults facing the child-rearing experience can take a cue from&nbsp;the Freedman study.&nbsp;<br>Suppose a couple wants to impress upon their daughter that lying is wrong. A strong,&nbsp;<br>clear threat (&quot;It's bad to lie, honey, so if I&nbsp;catch you at it, I'll cut your tongue out&quot;) might&nbsp;<br>well be effective when&nbsp;the parents&nbsp;are present or when the girl thinks she can be&nbsp;<br>discovered. However, it will not achieve the larger goal of convincing her that she does&nbsp;<br>not want to&nbsp;lie because&nbsp;<i>she&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>thinks it's wrong. To do that, a&nbsp;much subtler approach is&nbsp;<br>required. A reason must be given that is just&nbsp;strong enough to get her to&nbsp;be truthful most&nbsp;<br>of the time but is not so strong that she sees&nbsp;it as the obvious reason for her truthfulness.&nbsp;<br>It's a tricky&nbsp;business because this barely&nbsp;sufficient reason changes from&nbsp;child to child.&nbsp;<br>For one child, a simple appeal may be enough (&quot;It's&nbsp;bad to lie, honey, so I hope you&nbsp;<br>won't do it&quot;); for another, it may be necessary&nbsp;to&nbsp;add a somewhat stronger reason (&quot; ...&nbsp;<br>because if you do, I'll be disappointed in you&quot;);&nbsp;for a third child, a mild form&nbsp;of warning&nbsp;<br>may be required as well (&quot; . .. and I'll probably have to do something I don't want to&nbsp;<br>do&quot;). Wise parents&nbsp;will know which kind of&nbsp;reason will work&nbsp;on their own children.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<br>important thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;use a reason&nbsp;that will initially produce the desired behavior and&nbsp;<br>will, at&nbsp;the same time, allow a child to take&nbsp;personal responsibility for&nbsp;that behavior.&nbsp;<br>Thus, the less detectable outside&nbsp;pressure such a reason&nbsp;contains, the better. Selecting&nbsp;<br>just the right reason is not an easy task for parents, but the effort should pay off. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;<br>likely to mean the difference between&nbsp;short-lived compliance and long-term&nbsp;<br>commitment. As Samuel Butler wrote more&nbsp;than 300 years ago, &quot;He&nbsp;who agrees against&nbsp;<br>his will / Is of&nbsp;the&nbsp;same opinion still.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Growing Legs to Stand On</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
For a pair of reasons we have already talked about, compliance&nbsp;professionals love&nbsp;<br>commitments that produce inner change. First,&nbsp;that change&nbsp;is not just specific to the&nbsp;<br>situation where it first occurred; it covers&nbsp;a whole range of related&nbsp;situations,&nbsp;too.&nbsp;<br>Second, the effects of the change are lasting.&nbsp;So, once people have been induced to take&nbsp;<br>actions that shift their self-images to that&nbsp;of, let's say, public-spirited citizens, they are&nbsp;<br>likely to be public-spirited in a variety of&nbsp;other circumstances where their compliance&nbsp;<br>may also be desired. And they&nbsp;are likely to continue their public-spirited behavior for as&nbsp;<br>long as their new self-images hold.&nbsp;<br>
There is yet another attraction in commitments that lead to inner change—they &quot;grow&nbsp;<br>their own legs.&quot; There is no need for the compliance professional to undertake a costly&nbsp;<br>and continuing effort to reinforce the&nbsp;change; the&nbsp;pressure for&nbsp;consistency&nbsp;will take care&nbsp;<br>of all that. After people come&nbsp;to view themselves as public-spirited citizens, they will&nbsp;<br>automatically begin&nbsp;to see things differently.&nbsp;They will convince themselves&nbsp;that it is&nbsp;<br>the correct way to be and will begin to pay attention to facts they hadn't noticed before&nbsp;<br>about the value of community service. They will make themselves&nbsp;<br>
<i>&nbsp;</i><br>

available to hear arguments they hadn't&nbsp;heard before favoring civic&nbsp;action and will&nbsp;find&nbsp;<br>such arguments more persuasive than before. In general, because of the need to be&nbsp;<br>consistent within their system&nbsp;of&nbsp;beliefs, they&nbsp;will assure themselves that their choice to&nbsp;<br>take public-spirited action was right. What is&nbsp;important about this&nbsp;process of generating&nbsp;<br>additional reasons to justify the commitment is that the reasons are&nbsp;<i>new.&nbsp;</i>Thus, even if&nbsp;<br>the original reason&nbsp;for the civic-minded&nbsp;behavior were taken away, these newly&nbsp;<br>discovered reasons alone might&nbsp;be enough to support their perceptions that they had&nbsp;<br>behaved correctly.&nbsp;<br>
The advantage to an unscrupulous compliance professional is tremendous. Because we&nbsp;<br>build new struts to undergird choices we have committed ourselves to, an exploitative&nbsp;<br>individual can offer us an inducement for making such a choice. After the decision has&nbsp;<br>been made, the individual can remove that&nbsp;inducement, knowing that our decision will&nbsp;<br>probably stand on its own newly created legs.&nbsp;Car dealers frequently&nbsp;try to benefit from&nbsp;<br>this process through a trick they call &quot;throwing&nbsp;a low-ball.&quot; I first encountered the tactic&nbsp;<br>while posing as a sales&nbsp;trainee at a local Chevrolet dealership. After a week of basic&nbsp;<br>instruction, I was allowed to watch the regular salespeople perform.&nbsp;One practice that&nbsp;<br>caught my attention right away was the low-ball.&nbsp;<br>
For certain&nbsp;customers, a very good price,&nbsp;perhaps as much as $400 below competitors'&nbsp;<br>prices, is offered on a car. The good deal, however, is not&nbsp;genuine; the dealer never&nbsp;<br>intends it to go through.&nbsp;Its only purpose is to cause prospects to&nbsp;<i>decide&nbsp;</i>to buy one of&nbsp;<br>the dealership's cars. Once the decision is&nbsp;made, a number of activities develop the&nbsp;<br>customer's sense of personal commitment to the car—a fistful of purchase forms are&nbsp;<br>filled out, extensive financing terms are arranged, sometimes the customer is&nbsp;<br>encouraged to drive the car for a day before signing the contract, &quot;so you can get the&nbsp;<br>feel of it and show it around the neighborhood and at work.&quot; During this time, the dealer&nbsp;<br>knows, customers typically develop a range&nbsp;of new reasons to support their choice and&nbsp;<br>to justify the investments they have now&nbsp;made (Brockner &amp; Rubin, 1985; Teger, 1980).&nbsp;<br>
Then something happens. Occasionally an &quot;error&quot; in&nbsp;the calculations is discovered—&nbsp;<br>maybe the salesperson forgot to add the cost&nbsp;of the air conditioner, and if the buyer still&nbsp;<br>requires air-conditioning, $400 must&nbsp;be added&nbsp;to the price. To throw suspicion off&nbsp;<br>themselves, some dealers let the&nbsp;bank&nbsp;handling the financing find the mistake. At other&nbsp;<br>times, the deal is disallowed at the last moment; the salesperson checks with his or&nbsp;her&nbsp;<br>boss, who cancels it because &quot;the dealership&nbsp;would be losing money.&quot; For only another&nbsp;<br>$400 the car can be had,&nbsp;which, in the context of a multithousand-dol-lar deal, doesn't&nbsp;<br>seem&nbsp;too steep since, as the salesperson emphasizes,&nbsp;the cost is equal to competitors'&nbsp;<br>and &quot;This is the car you chose, right?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Another, even more insidious form&nbsp;of low-balling occurs when the salesperson makes&nbsp;<br>an inflated trade-in offer on the prospect's&nbsp;old car as part of the buy/trade package. The&nbsp;<br>customer recognizes the offer as overly generous and jumps at the deal. Later, before&nbsp;<br>the contract is signed, the used-car&nbsp;manager says that the salesperson's&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=95></a>87&nbsp;<i>Chapter 3</i>&nbsp;<br>
estimate was $400 too high and reduces the trade-in allowance to its actual, blue-book&nbsp;<br>level. The customer, realizing that the reduced offer is the fair one, accepts it as&nbsp;<br>appropriate&nbsp;and sometimes feels guilty about trying to take advantage of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>salesperson's high estimate. I once witnessed a woman provide an embarrassed apology&nbsp;<br>to a salesman who had used the last version of low-balling on her—this&nbsp;while she was&nbsp;<br>signing a new-car contract giving him a huge&nbsp;commission. He looked hurt but managed&nbsp;<br>a forgiving smile.&nbsp;<br>
No matter which variety of low-balling is used, the sequence is the same: An advantage&nbsp;<br>is offered that induces a favorable purchase decision. Then, sometime after the decision&nbsp;<br>has been made, but before the bargain is&nbsp;sealed, the original purchase advantage is&nbsp;<br>deftly removed. It seems almost incredible&nbsp;that a customer would buy a car under these&nbsp;<br>circumstances. Yet it works—not on everybody,&nbsp;of course, but it is effective enough to&nbsp;<br>be a staple compliance procedure in many&nbsp;car showrooms.&nbsp;Automobile dealers have&nbsp;<br>come&nbsp;to understand the ability of a personal commitment&nbsp;to build its own support&nbsp;<br>system, a support system&nbsp;of new justifications for the commitment. Often these&nbsp;<br>justifications provide so many strong legs for the decision to stand on that when the&nbsp;<br>dealer pulls away only one leg, the original one,&nbsp;there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;collapse. The loss can be&nbsp;<br>shrugged off by the customer who is&nbsp;consoled, even made happy, by the array of other&nbsp;<br>good reasons favoring the choice. It never occurs to the buyer that those additional&nbsp;<br>reasons might never have existed had the choice not been made in&nbsp;the first place.&nbsp;<br>
After watching the low-ball technique work&nbsp;so&nbsp;impressively in the car showroom, I&nbsp;<br>decided to test its effectiveness in another setting where I could see if&nbsp;the basic idea&nbsp;<br>worked with&nbsp;a bit of&nbsp;a twist. That is, the&nbsp;car salespeople I observed threw the low-ball&nbsp;<br>by proposing sweet deals, getting favorable decisions as a result, and then taking away&nbsp;<br>the sweet part of the offers. If my&nbsp;thinking about the essence of the low-ball procedure&nbsp;<br>was correct,&nbsp;I recognized&nbsp;that I should be able&nbsp;to get the tactic to work&nbsp;in a somewhat&nbsp;<br>different way: I could offer a good deal, which would produce the crucial decisional&nbsp;<br>commitment, and then I could&nbsp;<i>add&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>an&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>un</i>pleasant feature to&nbsp;the arrangement. Because&nbsp;<br>the effect of&nbsp;the low-ball technique was to&nbsp;get an individual to stick with a deal, even&nbsp;<br>after circumstances had changed to make it a poor one, the&nbsp;tactic should work whether a&nbsp;<br>positive aspect of&nbsp;the deal was removed or a negative aspect&nbsp;was added.&nbsp;<br>
So, to test this latter&nbsp;possibility, my colleagues John Cacioppo, Rod Bassett, John&nbsp;<br>Miller, and I ran an experiment designed to get Introductory Psychology students at&nbsp;<br>Ohio State University to agree to perform&nbsp;an unpleasant activity: to&nbsp;wake up very early&nbsp;<br>to participate in a 7:00 A.M. study &quot;on thinking&nbsp;processes.&quot; When calling one sample of&nbsp;<br>students, we immediately informed them&nbsp;of&nbsp;the 7:00 A.M. starting time. Only 24&nbsp;<br>percent were willing to participate. However,&nbsp;when calling a second sample of students,&nbsp;<br>we threw a low-ball: We&nbsp;first asked if&nbsp;they wanted to participate in a study of&nbsp;thinking&nbsp;<br>processes, and after they responded—56 percent of them&nbsp;positively—we mentioned the&nbsp;<br>7:00 A.M. start time and gave them&nbsp;the chance to&nbsp;change their minds.&nbsp;<i>None&nbsp;</i>of them&nbsp;did.&nbsp;<br>What's more, in keeping with their commitment to&nbsp;<br>
<i>&nbsp;</i><br>
<i>&nbsp;</i><br>
<hr>
<a name=96></a><i>Commitment and Consistency 88</i>&nbsp;<br>
participate, 95 percent of the low-balled students did come&nbsp;to the Psychology Building&nbsp;<br>at 7:00 A.M. as promised. I know this to be the case because I recruited&nbsp;two research&nbsp;<br>assistants to be on site at that time&nbsp;to&nbsp;conduct the thinking processes experiment and to&nbsp;<br>take the names of the students who appeared.4&nbsp;<br>
The impressive thing about the low-ball tactic&nbsp;is its ability to make a person feel pleased&nbsp;<br>with a poor choice. Those who&nbsp;have only poor choices to offer us are especially fond of&nbsp;<br>the technique. We can find them&nbsp;throwing low-balls in business, social, and personal&nbsp;<br>situations. For instance, there's my&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;Tim, a true low-ball aficionado. Recall that&nbsp;<br>he's the one who, by promising to change his&nbsp;ways, got his girlfriend,&nbsp;Sara, to cancel her&nbsp;<br>impending marriage to another and take him&nbsp;back. Since her decision to choose Tim,&nbsp;<br>Sara has become&nbsp;more devoted to him than&nbsp;ever, even though he has not fulfilled&nbsp;his&nbsp;<br>promises. She explains this by saying that she has allowed&nbsp;herself&nbsp;to see all sorts of&nbsp;<br>positive qualities in Tim she had never recognized before.&nbsp;<br>
I know full well that Sara is a&nbsp;low-ball victim. Just as I had watched buyers fall for the&nbsp;<br>give-it-and-take-it-away-later&nbsp;strategy&nbsp;in the car&nbsp;showroom, I watched her fall for the&nbsp;<br>same trick with Tim.&nbsp;For his part, Tim remains the guy he has always been. Because the&nbsp;<br>new attractions Sara has discovered (or created) in him are quite real for her, she now&nbsp;<br>seems satisfied with&nbsp;the same&nbsp;arrangement that was unacceptable before her enormous&nbsp;<br>commitment. The decision to choose Tim,&nbsp;poor as it may have been objectively, has&nbsp;<br>grown its own supports and appears to have&nbsp;made Sara genuinely happy. I have never&nbsp;<br>mentioned to Sara what I know about low-balling. The reason for my silence is not that&nbsp;<br>I think her better off in the dark on the issue. As a general guiding principle, more&nbsp;<br>information is always better than less information. It's just that, if&nbsp;I said a word, I am&nbsp;<br>confident she would&nbsp;hate&nbsp;me&nbsp;for it.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Standing Up for the Public Good</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Depending on the motives of the person wishing to use them, any of the compliance&nbsp;<br>techniques discussed in this book can be employed for good or for ill. It should not be&nbsp;<br>surprising, then, that the low-ball tactic can&nbsp;be used for more socially beneficial&nbsp;<br>purposes than selling new cars or reestablishing relationships with former lovers. One&nbsp;<br>research project done in Iowa (Pallak,&nbsp;Cook, &amp; Sullivan, 1980), for example,&nbsp;<br>
There is no foundation to the rumor that, in&nbsp;recruiting my&nbsp;research&nbsp;assistants for this&nbsp;<br>task, I first asked if they wanted to administer a study on thinking processes and, after&nbsp;<br>they agreed,&nbsp;informed them&nbsp;of the 7:00 A.M. starting time.&nbsp;<br>
In addition to the just-described study, several other experiments have attested to the&nbsp;<br>effectiveness of the low-ball&nbsp;procedure in&nbsp;a variety of circumstances&nbsp;(see Brownstein &amp;&nbsp;<br>Katzev, 1985; Burger &amp; Petty, 1981; Joule,&nbsp;1987; see Cialdini, Cacioppo, Bassett, &amp;&nbsp;<br>Miller 1978 for full details).&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<a name=97></a>89&nbsp;<i>Chapter 3</i>&nbsp;<br>
shows how the low-ball procedure can influence homeowners to conserve energy. The&nbsp;<br>project began at the start of the Iowa&nbsp;winter when residents who heated their homes&nbsp;<br>with natural gas were contacted by&nbsp;an interviewer. The interviewer gave them&nbsp;some&nbsp;<br>energy-conservation tips and asked them&nbsp;to try to save fuel in the future. Although they&nbsp;<br>all agreed to try, when&nbsp;the researchers examined the utility records of&nbsp;these families&nbsp;<br>after a month and again at winter's end, it was clear that no real&nbsp;savings had occurred.&nbsp;<br>The residents who had promised to make a&nbsp;conservation attempt used just as much&nbsp;<br>natural gas as did a random&nbsp;sample of their neighbors who had not been contacted by an&nbsp;<br>interviewer. Good intentions&nbsp;coupled with information about saving fuel, then, were not&nbsp;<br>enough to change habits.&nbsp;<br>
Even before the project began, Pallak and&nbsp;his research team&nbsp;had recognized that&nbsp;<br>something more would be needed to shift&nbsp;long-standing energy-use patterns. So they&nbsp;<br>tried a slightly different procedure on a comparable sample of&nbsp;Iowa natural-gas users.&nbsp;<br>These people, too, were contacted by an interviewer, who provided energy-saving hints&nbsp;<br>and asked them to conserve, but for these families, the interviewer offered something&nbsp;<br>else: Those residents agreeing to save energy would have their names publicized in&nbsp;<br>newspaper articles as public-spirited, fuel-conserving&nbsp;citizens.&nbsp;The effect was&nbsp;<br>immediate. One month later, when&nbsp;the utility&nbsp;companies checked their meters, the&nbsp;<br>homeowners in this sample had saved an average of 422 cubic feet of natural gas apiece.&nbsp;<br>The chance to have their names in the paper&nbsp;had motivated these residents to substantial&nbsp;<br>conservation efforts for a period of a month.&nbsp;<br>
Then the rug was pulled out. The researchers extracted the reason that had initially&nbsp;<br>caused the people to save fuel. Each family&nbsp;that had been promised publicity received a&nbsp;<br>letter saying it would not be possible to publicize its name after all.&nbsp;<br>
At the end of the winter, the research team&nbsp;examined the effect the letter had on the&nbsp;<br>natural-gas usage of&nbsp;the&nbsp;families. Did they return&nbsp;to their old, wasteful habits when&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>chance to be in the newspaper was removed?&nbsp;Hardly. For each of the remaining winter&nbsp;<br>months, these families actually conserved&nbsp;<i>more&nbsp;</i>fuel than they&nbsp;had during the time they&nbsp;<br>thought they would be publicly celebrated for it! In terms of percentage of energy&nbsp;<br>savings, they had managed a 12.2 percent gas savings during the first month because&nbsp;<br>they expected to see themselves lauded in the paper. However, after the letter arrived&nbsp;<br>informing them&nbsp;to the contrary,&nbsp;they&nbsp;did not&nbsp;return to&nbsp;their previous energy-use levels;&nbsp;<br>instead, they increased their savings to a 15.5&nbsp;percent level for the rest of the winter.&nbsp;<br>
Although we can never be completely sure of&nbsp;such things, one explanation for their&nbsp;<br>persistent behavior presents itself immediately. These people had been low-balled into a&nbsp;<br>conservation commitment through a promise&nbsp;of newspaper publicity. Once made, that&nbsp;<br>commitment&nbsp;started generating its own support: The homeowners began acquiring new&nbsp;<br>energy habits, began feeling good about their&nbsp;public-spirited efforts, began convincing&nbsp;<br>themselves of the vital need to reduce&nbsp;American dependence on foreign fuel, began&nbsp;<br>appreciating&nbsp;the monetary savings in their utility bills, began feeling proud of their&nbsp;<br>capacity for self-denial, and most important, began viewing themselves as conservation-<br>minded. With&nbsp;all these new reasons present to justify the commitment&nbsp;<br>

to use less energy, it is no wonder that the&nbsp;commitment remained firm even after the&nbsp;<br>original reason, newspaper publicity, had been kicked away.&nbsp;<br>
Strangely enough, though, when the publicity factor was no longer a possibility, these&nbsp;<br>families did&nbsp;not merely&nbsp;maintain their fuel-saving effort, they heightened it.&nbsp;Any of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>number of interpretations could be offered&nbsp;for that still stronger effort, but I have a&nbsp;<br>favorite. In a way, the opportunity to receive&nbsp;newspaper publicity had&nbsp;prevented the&nbsp;<br>homeowners from&nbsp;fully owning their commitment to conservation. Of all the reasons&nbsp;<br>supporting the decision to try to&nbsp;save fuel, it was the only one that had come&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>outside; it was the only one&nbsp;preventing the homeowners from&nbsp;thinking that they&nbsp;were&nbsp;<br>conserving gas because they believed in it.&nbsp;So&nbsp;when the letter arrived&nbsp;canceling the&nbsp;<br>publicity agreement, it removed the only impediment to these residents'&nbsp;images of&nbsp;<br>themselves as fully concerned, energy-conscious citizens. This unqualified, new self-<br>image then pushed them&nbsp;to even greater heights of conservation.&nbsp;Much like Sara, they&nbsp;<br>appeared to have become committed to a choice through an initial inducement and were&nbsp;<br>still more dedicated to it after the inducement had been removed.5&nbsp;<br>
<b>DEFENSE</b>&nbsp;<br>
The only effective defense I know against the weapons of influence embodied in the&nbsp;<br>combined principles of commitment and consistency is an awareness that, although&nbsp;<br>consistency is generally good, even&nbsp;vital, there is a&nbsp;foolish, rigid variety to be shunned.&nbsp;<br>We must be wary of the tendency to be automatically and unthinkingly consistent, for it&nbsp;<br>lays us open to the maneuvers of those who want to exploit the mechanical&nbsp;<br>commitment-consistency sequence for profit.&nbsp;<br>
Since automatic consistency is&nbsp;so useful in allowing us&nbsp;an economical and appropriate&nbsp;<br>way of behaving most of the time, however, we can't&nbsp;decide merely to eliminate it from&nbsp;<br>our lives altogether. The results would be disastrous. If, rather than whirring along in&nbsp;<br>accordance with our prior decisions and deeds, we stopped to think through the merits&nbsp;<br>of each new action before performing it, we would never have time to accomplish&nbsp;<br>anything significant. We&nbsp;need even that dangerous, mechanical brand of consistency.&nbsp;<br>The only way out of the dilemma is to know when such consistency&nbsp;<br>
5Fortunately, it is not necessary to use so&nbsp;deceptive an&nbsp;approach as the low-ball&nbsp;<br>technique to employ the power of&nbsp;the commitment/consistency principle in public-<br>service campaigns. An impressive series of&nbsp;studies by Richard Katzev and his students&nbsp;<br>at Reed College has demonstrated&nbsp;the effectiveness of&nbsp;commitment tactics like&nbsp;written&nbsp;<br>pledges and foot-in-the-door&nbsp;procedures in increasing&nbsp;such energy conservation&nbsp;<br>behaviors as recycling, electricity usage, and bus ridership (Bachman &amp;&nbsp;Katzev, 1982;&nbsp;<br>Katzev &amp; Johnson, 1983, 1984; Katzev &amp; Pardini, 1988; Pardini &amp; Katzev, 1983-84).&nbsp;<br>

is likely to lead to a poor choice. There&nbsp;are certain signals—two separate kinds of&nbsp;<br>signals—to tip us off. We register each type in a different part of our bodies.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Stomach Signs</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
The first signal is easy to recognize. It occurs right in the pit of our stomachs when we&nbsp;<br>realize we are trapped into complying with a request we&nbsp;<i>know&nbsp;</i>we don't&nbsp;want to perform.&nbsp;<br>It has happened to me&nbsp;a hundred times. An&nbsp;especially memorable instance, though, took&nbsp;<br>place on a summer evening well&nbsp;before I began&nbsp;to study&nbsp;compliance tactics. I answered&nbsp;<br>my doorbell to find a stunning young woman dressed in shorts and&nbsp;a revealing halter&nbsp;<br>top. I noticed, nonetheless, that she was carrying a clipboard and was asking me to&nbsp;<br>participate in a survey. Wanting to make&nbsp;a favorable impression, I agreed and, I do&nbsp;<br>admit, stretched the truth&nbsp;in my&nbsp;interview answers in order to present myself&nbsp;in the most&nbsp;<br>positive light. Our conversation went as follows:&nbsp;<br>
<i>Stunning Young Woman:&nbsp;</i>Hello! I'm&nbsp;doing a survey&nbsp;on the entertainment habits of city&nbsp;residents,&nbsp;<br>and I wonder&nbsp;if&nbsp;you could answer a few questions for&nbsp;me.&nbsp;<i>Cialdini:&nbsp;</i>Do come in.&nbsp;<br>
<i>SYW:&nbsp;</i>Thank&nbsp;you. I'll just sit right&nbsp;here and begin.&nbsp;How&nbsp;many&nbsp;times per week would&nbsp;you&nbsp;say&nbsp;you&nbsp;<br>go out to&nbsp;dinner?&nbsp;<br>
<i>C:&nbsp;</i>Oh, probably&nbsp;three, maybe four times&nbsp;a week. Whenever I can, really; I love&nbsp;fine restaurants.&nbsp;<br>
<i>SYW:&nbsp;</i>How nice. And do&nbsp;you usually&nbsp;order wine with&nbsp;your&nbsp;dinner?&nbsp;<br>
<i>C:&nbsp;</i>Only&nbsp;if&nbsp;it's imported.&nbsp;<br>
<i>SYW:&nbsp;</i>I see.&nbsp;What about&nbsp;movies? Do&nbsp;you go to the movies&nbsp;much?&nbsp;<br>
<i>C:&nbsp;</i>The cinema? I can't get enough&nbsp;of good films. I especially&nbsp;like the sophisticated&nbsp;<br>
kind with&nbsp;the&nbsp;words on the&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;of the&nbsp;screen. How&nbsp;about&nbsp;you? Do&nbsp;you like to&nbsp;see&nbsp;<br>
films?&nbsp;<br>
<i>SYW:&nbsp;</i>Uh ...&nbsp;yes, I do. But let's get back to the interview. Do you&nbsp;go to many&nbsp;concerts?&nbsp;<br>
C: Definitely. The symphonic stuff mostly, of&nbsp;course. But I do&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;a quality pop group&nbsp;as&nbsp;<br>well.&nbsp;<br>
<i>SYW:&nbsp;(writing rapidly).&nbsp;</i>Great! just one more question. What about touring performances&nbsp;by&nbsp;<br>theatrical or ballet companies?&nbsp;Do&nbsp;you see them&nbsp;when they're in town?&nbsp;<i>C:&nbsp;</i>Ah, the ballet—the&nbsp;<br>movement, the grace, the&nbsp;form—I love&nbsp;it. Mark&nbsp;me down as&nbsp;<i>loving&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>the ballet. See it every&nbsp;<br>chance I get.&nbsp;<br>
<i>SYW:&nbsp;</i>Fine. Just let&nbsp;me&nbsp;recheck&nbsp;my&nbsp;figures here for a&nbsp;moment, Mr. Cialdini.&nbsp;<i>C:&nbsp;</i>Actually, it's Dr.&nbsp;<br>Cialdini. But that sounds so formal. Why&nbsp;don't you call&nbsp;me Bob?&nbsp;<i>SYW:&nbsp;</i>All right,&nbsp;<i>Bob.&nbsp;</i>From the&nbsp;<br>information you've already&nbsp;given me, I'm&nbsp;pleased to say&nbsp;you could save up to&nbsp;$1,200 a&nbsp;year by&nbsp;<br>joining&nbsp;<i>Clubamerica!&nbsp;</i>A small&nbsp;membership fee entitles you to&nbsp;discounts on most of the activities&nbsp;<br>you've mentioned. Surely&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=101></a>92&nbsp;<i>Chapter 3</i>&nbsp;<br>
someone as&nbsp;socially vigorous as yourself&nbsp;would want to take advantage of the&nbsp;<br>tremendous savings our company can offer on all the things you've already told me you&nbsp;<br>do.&nbsp;<br>
<i>C: (trapped like a rat).&nbsp;</i>Well... uh ... I... uh ... I guess so.&nbsp;<br>
I remember quite&nbsp;well feeling&nbsp;my&nbsp;stomach tighten as I stammered my&nbsp;agreement. It was&nbsp;<br>a clear call to my&nbsp;brain, &quot;Hey, you're being&nbsp;taken here!&quot; But I couldn't see a way out. I&nbsp;<br>had been cornered by my own words. To decline her offer at that point would have&nbsp;<br>meant facing a pair of distasteful alternatives: If I tried to back out by protesting that I&nbsp;<br>was not actually the man-about-town I had claimed to be during the interview, I would&nbsp;<br>come&nbsp;off a liar; trying&nbsp;to&nbsp;refuse without that protest would&nbsp;make me&nbsp;come off a fool for&nbsp;<br>not wanting to save $1,200.1 bought the entertainment package, even though I knew I&nbsp;<br>had been set up. The need to be consistent&nbsp;with what I had already said snared me.&nbsp;<br>
No more, though. I listen to my stomach these days, and I have discovered a way to&nbsp;<br>handle people who try to use the consistency principle on me. I just tell them&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;<br>what they are doing. This tactic has become&nbsp;the perfect counterattack for me. Whenever&nbsp;<br>my stomach tells me&nbsp;I would be a sucker&nbsp;to comply with&nbsp;a request merely because&nbsp;<br>doing so would be consistent with some&nbsp;prior commitment I was tricked into, I relay&nbsp;<br>that message to the requester.&nbsp;I don't try to&nbsp;deny the importance of&nbsp;consistency; I just&nbsp;<br>point out the absurdity of foolish consistency. Whether,&nbsp;in response, the requester&nbsp;<br>shrinks away&nbsp;guiltily or&nbsp;retreats in bewilderment, I am&nbsp;content. I have won; an exploiter&nbsp;<br>has lost.&nbsp;<br>
I sometimes think about the way it would be&nbsp;if that stunning young woman of years ago&nbsp;<br>were to try to sell me an entertainment-club membership now. I have it all worked out.&nbsp;<br>The entire interaction would be&nbsp;the same, except for the end:&nbsp;<br>
<i>SYW: ...&nbsp;</i>Surely someone&nbsp;as socially vigorous as&nbsp;yourself would want to take advantage&nbsp;<br>of the tremendous savings our company can offer on all the things you've already told&nbsp;<br>me&nbsp;you do.&nbsp;<br>
<i>C: (with great self-assurance).&nbsp;</i>Quite wrong. You see, I recognize what has gone on&nbsp;<br>here. I know that your story about doing a survey&nbsp;was just a pretext for getting people to&nbsp;<br>tell you how often they go out and that, under those circumstances, there is a natural&nbsp;<br>tendency to exaggerate. And I refuse to allow myself&nbsp;to be locked&nbsp;into a mechanical&nbsp;<br>sequence of commitment and consistency when I know it's wrong-headed. No&nbsp;<i>click,&nbsp;<br>whirr&nbsp;</i>for me.&nbsp;<i>SYW:&nbsp;</i>Huh?&nbsp;<br>
<i>C:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Okay, let me put it this way: (1) It would be stupid of me&nbsp;to spend money on&nbsp;<br>something I don't want. (2) I have it on excellent authority, direct from&nbsp;my stomach, that&nbsp;<br>I don't want your entertainment plan. (3) Therefore, if you still believe&nbsp;that I will buy it,&nbsp;<br>you probably also still believe&nbsp;in the Tooth Fairy. Surely,&nbsp;someone as intelligent as&nbsp;<br>yourself would be able to understand that.&nbsp;<i>SYW: (trapped like a stunning young rat)&nbsp;<br></i>Well... uh ... I... uh ... I guess so.&nbsp;<br>

<a name=102></a><i>Commitment and Consistency&nbsp;</i>93&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Heart-of-Hearts Signs</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Stomachs are not especially perceptive or subtle organs. Only when it is&nbsp;<i>obvious&nbsp;</i>that&nbsp;we&nbsp;<br>are about to be conned are they likely to register and transmit that message. At other&nbsp;<br>times, when it is not clear that we are&nbsp;being taken, our stomachs may never catch&nbsp;on.&nbsp;<br>Under those circumstances we have to look&nbsp;elsewhere for a clue. The situation of my&nbsp;<br>neighbor Sara provides&nbsp;a good illustration. She made an important&nbsp;commitment to Tim&nbsp;<br>by canceling her prior marriage&nbsp;plans. The commitment has grown its own supports, so&nbsp;<br>that even though the original reasons for the commitment are gone, she remains in&nbsp;<br>harmony with it. She has convinced herself with newly formed reasons that she did the&nbsp;<br>right thing, so she stays with Tim.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;not difficult to see why there would be no&nbsp;<br>tightening in Sara's stomach as a result. Stomachs tell us when we are doing something&nbsp;<br>we think is wrong for us. Sara&nbsp;<i>thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>no such thing. To her mind, she has chosen&nbsp;<br>correctly and is behaving consistently with that choice.&nbsp;<br>
Yet, unless I badly miss my guess, there is a part of Sara that recognizes her choice as a&nbsp;<br>mistake and her current living arrangement as&nbsp;a brand of foolish consistency. Where,&nbsp;<br>exactly, that part of Sara is&nbsp;located&nbsp;we can't&nbsp;be sure, but our language does give it a&nbsp;<br>name: heart of hearts. It is, by definition, the one place where we cannot fool ourselves.&nbsp;<br>It is the place where none of&nbsp;our justifications, none of our&nbsp;rationalizations penetrate.&nbsp;<br>Sara has the truth there, although right now she can't&nbsp;hear&nbsp;its signal clearly through the&nbsp;<br>noise and static of the new support apparatus she has erected.&nbsp;<br>
If Sara has erred in her choice of Tim, how long can she&nbsp;go without clearly recognizing&nbsp;<br>it, without having a massive heart-of-hearts&nbsp;attack? There&nbsp;is no telling. One thing is&nbsp;<br>certain, however: As time passes, the various&nbsp;alternatives to Tim are disappearing. She&nbsp;<br>had better determine soon whether she is making a mistake.&nbsp;<br>
Easier said than done, of course. She must&nbsp;answer an extremely intricate question:&nbsp;<br>&quot;Knowing what I now know, if I&nbsp;could go back in time, would I make the same&nbsp;<br>choice?&quot; The problem&nbsp;lies in&nbsp;the &quot;knowing what I now know&quot;&nbsp;part of the question, just&nbsp;<br>what does she now know, accurately, about Tim?&nbsp;How much of what she thinks&nbsp;of him&nbsp;<br>is the result of&nbsp;a desperate attempt to justify the commitment she made? She claims&nbsp;that,&nbsp;<br>since her decision to take him&nbsp;back, he cares for her more,&nbsp;is trying hard to stop his&nbsp;<br>excessive drinking, has learned&nbsp;to make a wonderful omelet,&nbsp;etc. Having tasted a couple&nbsp;<br>of his omelets, I have my doubts. The important issue, though, is whether&nbsp;<i>she&nbsp;</i>believes&nbsp;<br>these things,&nbsp;not just intellectually—but in her heart of hearts.&nbsp;<br>
There may be a little device Sara can use to find out how much of her current&nbsp;<br>satisfaction with Tim is real and how much is foolish consistency. Psychological&nbsp;<br>evidence indicates that we experience our&nbsp;feelings toward&nbsp;something a split second&nbsp;<br>before we can intellectualize about it (Murphy &amp; Zajonc, 1993). My&nbsp;suspicion is that&nbsp;<br>the message sent by the heart of hearts is a&nbsp;pure, basic feeling. Therefore, if we train&nbsp;<br>ourselves to be attentive, we&nbsp;should register the feeling ever so slightly before our&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=103></a>94&nbsp;<i>Chapter 3</i>&nbsp;<br>
cognitive apparatus engages. According to this approach, were Sara to ask herself the&nbsp;<br>crucial &quot;would I make the same choice again?&quot; question, she would&nbsp;be well advised to&nbsp;<br>look for and trust the first flash of feeling she experienced in response. It would likely&nbsp;<br>be the signal from&nbsp;her heart of hearts, slipping through undistorted just before the means&nbsp;<br>by which she could kid herself flooded in.6&nbsp;<br>
I have begun using the same device myself whenever I even suspect&nbsp;I might be acting in&nbsp;<br>a foolishly consistent manner. One time, for&nbsp;instance, I had stopped at the self-service&nbsp;<br>pump&nbsp;of&nbsp;a filling&nbsp;station&nbsp;advertising a price&nbsp;per gallon a couple of&nbsp;cents below the rate&nbsp;<br>of other stations in the area;&nbsp;but with pump nozzle in hand, I&nbsp;noticed that the price listed&nbsp;<br>on the pump was two cents higher than the&nbsp;display sign price. When I&nbsp;mentioned the&nbsp;<br>difference to a passing attendant, who I later learned was the owner, he mumbled&nbsp;<br>unconvincingly that the rates had changed a few&nbsp;days ago, but there hadn't&nbsp;been time to&nbsp;<br>correct the display. I tried to decide what&nbsp;to do. Some reasons for staying came&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>mind—&quot;I really do need gasoline badly.&quot; &quot;This pump is available, and I am&nbsp;in sort of a&nbsp;<br>hurry.&quot; &quot;I think I remember that my&nbsp;car runs better on this brand of gas.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
I needed to&nbsp;determine whether those reasons were genuine or&nbsp;mere justifications for my&nbsp;<br>decision to stop there.&nbsp;So I asked myself the crucial question, &quot;Knowing what I know&nbsp;<br>about the real price of this gasoline, if I could go back in time, would I make the same&nbsp;<br>choice again?&quot; Concentrating on the first burst&nbsp;of impression I sensed, I received a clear&nbsp;<br>and unqualified answer. I would have driven&nbsp;right past. I wouldn't even have slowed&nbsp;<br>down. I knew then that, without the price advantage, those other reasons would not have&nbsp;<br>brought me&nbsp;there. They hadn't created the&nbsp;decision; the decision had created them.&nbsp;<br>
That settled, there was another decision to&nbsp;be faced. Since I was&nbsp;already there holding&nbsp;<br>the hose, wouldn't it be better to use it than to suffer the inconvenience of going&nbsp;<br>elsewhere to pay the same&nbsp;price? Fortunately,&nbsp;the station attendant-owner came over&nbsp;<br>and helped me&nbsp;make up my&nbsp;mind. He asked why I wasn't&nbsp;pumping any gas. I told him&nbsp;I&nbsp;<br>didn't like the price discrepancy and he said with a snarl, &quot;Listen, nobody's gonna tell&nbsp;<br>me&nbsp;how to run my business. If you think&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;cheating you, just put that hose down&nbsp;<i>right&nbsp;<br>now&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>and get off my property as fast as you&nbsp;can do it, bud.&quot; Already certain he was a&nbsp;<br>cheat, I was happy to act consistently with my belief and&nbsp;his wishes. I dropped the hose&nbsp;<br>on the spot. . . and drove over it on my way to the closest exit. Sometimes&nbsp;consistency&nbsp;<br>can be a marvelously rewarding thing.&nbsp;<br>
6This is not to say that what we feel about an&nbsp;issue is always different from&nbsp;or always to&nbsp;<br>be trusted more than what we think about&nbsp;it. However, the data are clear that our&nbsp;<br>emotions and beliefs often do not point in the same&nbsp;direction. Therefore, in situations&nbsp;<br>involving a commitment&nbsp;likely to have generated supporting rationalizations, feelings&nbsp;<br>may well provide the truer counsel. This would&nbsp;be especially so when, as in the question&nbsp;<br>of Sara's&nbsp;happiness, the issue at hand&nbsp;concerns an emotion (Wilson et al., 1989).&nbsp;<br>

<b>READER'S&nbsp;REPORT 3.2</b>&nbsp;<br>
<b>From a Woman Living in Portland, Oregon</b>&nbsp;<br>
I was walking through downtown Portland on my&nbsp;way to a lunch appointment when a&nbsp;<br>young, attractive man stopped me&nbsp;with a friendly smile and a powerful line. &quot;Excuse&nbsp;<br>me,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm&nbsp;involved in a contest and I need a good-looking woman like yourself&nbsp;<br>to help me&nbsp;win.&quot; I was truly skeptical&nbsp;since I know there are many women more&nbsp;<br>attractive than myself running around; however, I was caught off guard and was curious&nbsp;<br>to find out what he wanted. He explained that he would receive points for a contest by&nbsp;<br>getting total strangers to&nbsp;give him a kiss. Now, I consider myself&nbsp;to be a fairly level-<br>headed person who shouldn't have believed his line, but he was quite persistent, and&nbsp;<br>since I was almost late for my&nbsp;lunch appointment, I thought, &quot;What the heck, I'll give&nbsp;<br>the guy a kiss and get out of&nbsp;here.&quot; So I did something totally against my common sense&nbsp;<br>and pecked this total stranger on the cheek&nbsp;in the middle of downtown Portland!&nbsp;<br>
I thought that would be the end&nbsp;of it, but I soon learned that it was just the beginning.&nbsp;<br>Much to&nbsp;my&nbsp;distress,&nbsp;he followed the kiss with the line, &quot;You are a&nbsp;great kisser, but the&nbsp;<br>real contest I am involved in is to sell magazine subscriptions. You must be an active&nbsp;<br>person. Would any of these magazines interest you?&quot;&nbsp;At this&nbsp;point I should have&nbsp;<br>slugged the guy and walked away, but somehow,&nbsp;because I had complied with his initial&nbsp;<br>request, I felt a need to be consistent and&nbsp;I complied with his second request. Yes, much&nbsp;<br>to my&nbsp;own disbelief,&nbsp;I actually subscribed&nbsp;to&nbsp;<i>SKI&nbsp;</i>magazine (which I occasionally enjoy&nbsp;<br>reading, but had no intention to subscribing&nbsp;to), gave him&nbsp;a $5 initial subscription fee&nbsp;<br>and left as quickly as possible, feeling quite&nbsp;frustrated with what I had just done and not&nbsp;<br>understanding why I had done it.&nbsp;<br>
Although it still pains me&nbsp;to think about it, in reflecting on&nbsp;the incident&nbsp;after reading&nbsp;<br>your book I've now figured out what happened. The reason this tactic worked so&nbsp;<br>effectively is because once small commitments have been made (in this case, giving&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>kiss), people tend to add justifications to&nbsp;support the commitment, and then are willing&nbsp;<br>to commit themselves further.&nbsp;In this situation,&nbsp;I justified complying with the second&nbsp;<br>request because it was consistent&nbsp;with my&nbsp;initial action. If I had only listened to my&nbsp;<br>&quot;stomach signs,&quot; I could&nbsp;have saved myself a lot of humiliation.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Authors'note:&nbsp;</b>By extracting a kiss, the salesman exploited the consistency principle in&nbsp;<br>two ways. First, by the time he asked for her aid in the magazine contest, his prospect&nbsp;<br>had already gone on record—with that kiss</i>—<i>as agreeing to help&nbsp;him win a contest.&nbsp;<br>Second, it seems only natural (i.e., congruent)&nbsp;that if a woman feels positively enough&nbsp;<br>toward a man to kiss him, she should feel positively toward helping him out.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<b>SUMMARY</b>&nbsp;<br>
Psychologists have long recognized a desire in most people to be and look consistent&nbsp;<br>within their words, beliefs, attitudes, and deeds. This tendency for consistency is&nbsp;fed&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;three sources. First, good personal consistency is highly&nbsp;<br>
<b>&nbsp;</b><br>
<hr>
<a name=105></a><b>96&nbsp;</b><i>Chapter 3</i>&nbsp;<br>
valued by society. Second, aside from&nbsp;its effect on public image, generally consistent&nbsp;<br>conduct provides a beneficial approach to&nbsp;daily life. Third, a consistent orientation&nbsp;<br>affords a valuable shortcut through&nbsp;the complexity of&nbsp;modern existence. By being&nbsp;<br>consistent with earlier&nbsp;decisions, one reduces the need to&nbsp;process all the relevant&nbsp;<br>information in future similar situations; instead,&nbsp;one merely needs to recall the earlier&nbsp;<br>decision and to respond consistently with it.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;Within the realm&nbsp;of&nbsp;compliance, securing an&nbsp;initial commitment is the key. After&nbsp;<br>making a commitment (that is, taking&nbsp;a stand or&nbsp;position),&nbsp;people are&nbsp;more willing&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>agree to requests that are in keeping&nbsp;with the prior commitment. Thus, many&nbsp;<br>compliance professionals try to induce people to take an initial position that is&nbsp;<br>consistent with a behavior they&nbsp;will later&nbsp;request from&nbsp;these people. Not all&nbsp;<br>commitments are equally effective, however, in producing consistent future action.&nbsp;<br>Commitments are most effective when they are active, public, effortful, and viewed as&nbsp;<br>internally motivated (uncoerced).&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;Commitment decisions, even erroneous ones,&nbsp;have a tendency to be self-perpetuating&nbsp;<br>because they can &quot;grow their own&nbsp;legs.&quot;&nbsp;That is, people often add new reasons&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br>justifications to support the wisdom of commitments they have already made. As a&nbsp;<br>consequence, some commitments remain in effect long after the conditions that spurred&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;have changed. This phenomenon explains&nbsp;the effectiveness of certain deceptive&nbsp;<br>compliance practices such as&nbsp;&quot;throwing the low-ball.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;To recognize and resist the undue influence of consistency pressures on our&nbsp;<br>compliance decisions, we&nbsp;should listen for signals coming from&nbsp;two places within us:&nbsp;<br>our stomachs and our heart of hearts. Stomach&nbsp;signs appear when we&nbsp;realize that&nbsp;we are&nbsp;<br>being pushed by commitment and consistency&nbsp;pressures to agree to requests we know&nbsp;<br>we don't&nbsp;want to perform.&nbsp;Under these circumstances, it is best to explain to the&nbsp;<br>requester that such&nbsp;compliance would constitute&nbsp;a brand of&nbsp;foolish consistency in which&nbsp;<br>we prefer not to engage. Heart-of-heart signs are different. They are best employed&nbsp;<br>when it is not clear to us that&nbsp;an initial commitment was&nbsp;wrongheaded. Here, we should&nbsp;<br>ask ourselves a crucial question, &quot;Knowing what I know, if&nbsp;I could go back in time,&nbsp;<br>would I make the same&nbsp;commitment?&quot;&nbsp;One informative answer may come as the first&nbsp;<br>flash of feeling registered.&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=108></a>I don't know anyone who likes canned laughter. In fact, when I surveyed the people who&nbsp;<br>came into my office one day—several students, two telephone repairmen, a number of&nbsp;<br>university professors, and the janitor—the&nbsp;reaction was invariably&nbsp;critical. Television,&nbsp;<br>with its incessant system&nbsp;of laugh tracks and technically augmented mirth, received&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>most heat. The people I questioned hated&nbsp;canned laughter. They called it stupid, phony,&nbsp;<br>and obvious. Although my sample was small, I&nbsp;would bet that it closely reflects the&nbsp;<br>negative feelings of most&nbsp;of the American public toward laugh tracks.&nbsp;<br>
Why, then, is canned laughter so popular with television executives?&nbsp;They have won&nbsp;<br>their exalted positions and splendid salaries&nbsp;by knowing how to give&nbsp;the public what&nbsp;it&nbsp;<br>wants. Yet they religiously employ the laugh tracks that their audiences&nbsp;find distasteful,&nbsp;<br>and they do so over the objections&nbsp;of&nbsp;many of&nbsp;their&nbsp;most talented&nbsp;artists. It&nbsp;is not&nbsp;<br>uncommon for acclaimed directors, writers,&nbsp;or actors to demand the elimination of&nbsp;<br>canned responses from the television projects they undertake. These demands are only&nbsp;<br>sometimes successful, and when they are,&nbsp;it is&nbsp;not without a&nbsp;battle,&nbsp;as has been the&nbsp;case&nbsp;<br>with ABC's critically&nbsp;acclaimed situation-comedy&nbsp;<i>Sports Night.&nbsp;</i>Although the show's&nbsp;<br>producers pressed from the start for laugh-track-free airings, network officials have&nbsp;<br>relented in only one instance—when an episode explored the sensitive issue of sexual&nbsp;<br>assault (Collins, 1998).&nbsp;<br>
What can it be about canned laughter that is&nbsp;so attractive to television executives?&nbsp;Why&nbsp;<br>are these shrewd and tested people championing a practice that their potential watchers&nbsp;<br>find disagreeable and&nbsp;their most creative talents find personally insulting?&nbsp;The answer&nbsp;is&nbsp;<br>both simple and intriguing: They know what&nbsp;the research says. Experiments have found&nbsp;<br>that the use of canned merriment causes an&nbsp;audience to laugh longer and more often&nbsp;<br>when humorous material is presented and to&nbsp;rate the material as funnier (Fuller &amp;&nbsp;<br>Sheehy-Skeffington, 1974; Smyth &amp; Fuller, 1972).&nbsp;In addition, some&nbsp;evidence indicates&nbsp;<br>that canned laughter is most effective&nbsp;for poor jokes (No-sanchuk &amp; Lightstone, 1974).&nbsp;<br>
In light&nbsp;of&nbsp;these data, the actions of&nbsp;television executives make perfect sense. The&nbsp;<br>introduction of laugh tracks&nbsp;into their comic programming increases the humorous and&nbsp;<br>appreciative responses of an audience, even—and especially—when the material is of&nbsp;<br>poor quality. Is it any surprise,&nbsp;then, that television, glutted as&nbsp;it is with artless situation-<br>comedies, is saturated with canned laughter?&nbsp;Those executives know&nbsp;precisely what&nbsp;<br>they are doing.&nbsp;<br>
With the mystery of the widespread use of&nbsp;laugh tracks solved, we are left with a more&nbsp;<br>perplexing question: Why does canned laughter&nbsp;work on us the way&nbsp;it does?&nbsp;It is no&nbsp;<br>longer the television executives&nbsp;who appear peculiar; they&nbsp;are acting logically and in&nbsp;<br>their own interests. Instead, it is the behavior of the audience that seems strange. Why&nbsp;<br>should we laugh more at comedy material afloat in a sea of mechanically fabricated&nbsp;<br>merriment?&nbsp;And why should we think that comic flotsam funnier?&nbsp;The executives aren't&nbsp;<br>really fooling us. Anyone can&nbsp;recognize dubbed laughter. It is&nbsp;<br>

so blatant, so&nbsp;clearly counterfeit, that there&nbsp;can be no confusing it&nbsp;with the real thing.&nbsp;<br>We know full well that the hilarity we hear is irrelevant to the humorous quality of the&nbsp;<br>joke it follows, is created not spontaneously&nbsp;by a genuine audience but artificially by a&nbsp;<br>technician at a control board. Yet, transparent forgery that it is, it works on us!&nbsp;<br>
<b>THE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIAL PROOF</b>&nbsp;<br>
To discover why canned laughter&nbsp;is so effective, we first&nbsp;need to understand the nature&nbsp;<br>of yet another potent weapon of influence: the principle of social proof. This principle&nbsp;<br>states that we determine what is correct&nbsp;by finding out what other people think is&nbsp;<br>correct. The&nbsp;principle applies especially to the way we decide what constitutes correct&nbsp;<br>behavior.&nbsp;<i>We view a behavior as correct in a given&nbsp;situation to the degree that we see&nbsp;<br>others performing it.&nbsp;</i>Whether the question is what to do with an empty popcorn box in&nbsp;<br>a movie theater, how fast to drive on a certain stretch of highway, or how to eat the&nbsp;<br>chicken at a dinner party, the actions of&nbsp;those around us will be important&nbsp;guides in&nbsp;<br>defining the answer.&nbsp;<br>
The tendency to see an action as appropriate&nbsp;when others are doing it works quite well&nbsp;<br>normally. As a rule,&nbsp;we will make fewer&nbsp;mistakes by acting in&nbsp;accord with&nbsp;social&nbsp;<br>evidence than by acting contrary to it.&nbsp;Usually, when a lot of people are doing&nbsp;<br>something, it is the right thing to do. This feature of the principle of social proof is&nbsp;<br>simultaneously its major strength and its major weakness. Like the other weapons of&nbsp;<br>influence, it provides a convenient shortcut for determining the way to behave but, at&nbsp;<br>the same time, makes one who uses the shortcut vulnerable to the attacks of profiteers&nbsp;<br>who lie in wait along its path.&nbsp;<br>
In the case of canned laughter, the problem&nbsp;comes when we&nbsp;begin responding to social&nbsp;<br>proof in such a mindless and reflexive fashion&nbsp;that we can be fooled by partial or fake&nbsp;<br>evidence. Our folly is not that we use others'&nbsp;laughter to help decide what is humorous;&nbsp;<br>that is in keeping with the well-founded principle of social proof. The folly is that we do&nbsp;<br>so in response to patently fraudulent laughter. Somehow, one disembodied feature of&nbsp;<br>humor—a sound—works like the essence of humor. The example from&nbsp;Chapter 1 of the&nbsp;<br>turkey and the polecat is&nbsp;instructive. Because the peculiar cheep-cheep of&nbsp;turkey chicks&nbsp;<br>is normally associated with newborn turkeys, their mothers will display or withhold&nbsp;<br>maternal care solely on the basis of that&nbsp;sound. Remember how, consequently, it was&nbsp;<br>possible to fool a mother turkey with a stuffed polecat as&nbsp;long&nbsp;as the replica played the&nbsp;<br>recorded cheep-cheep of a baby turkey. The simulated chick sound was enough to start&nbsp;<br>the mother turkey's maternal tape whirring.&nbsp;<br>
The lesson of&nbsp;the turkey&nbsp;and the polecat illustrates uncomfortably well the relationship&nbsp;<br>between the average viewer and the laugh-track-playing television executive. We&nbsp;have&nbsp;<br>become so accustomed to taking the humorous&nbsp;reactions of others as evidence of what&nbsp;<br>deserves laughter that we too can be&nbsp;made to respond to the sound, and not the&nbsp;<br>substance, of the real thing. Much as a cheep-cheep noise removed from the reality of a&nbsp;<br>chick can&nbsp;stimulate a female turkey&nbsp;to mother, so can a recorded ha-ha removed from&nbsp;<br>the reality of a genuine audience&nbsp;stimulate us to laugh.

Television executives are hardly alone in their use of social evidence for profit. Our&nbsp;<br>tendency to assume&nbsp;that an action is more correct if others are doing&nbsp;it is exploited in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>variety of settings. Bartenders often salt their tip jars with a few dollar bills at the&nbsp;<br>beginning of an evening to simulate tips left&nbsp;by prior customers and thereby to give the&nbsp;<br>impression that tipping with folding money is&nbsp;proper barroom behavior. Church ushers&nbsp;<br>sometimes salt collection baskets&nbsp;for the same&nbsp;reason and with the same positive effect&nbsp;<br>on proceeds.&nbsp;Evangelical preachers are known to&nbsp;seed their audience with ringers, who&nbsp;<br>are rehearsed to come&nbsp;forward at a specified time&nbsp;to give witness and donations. For&nbsp;<br>example, a research team&nbsp;at Arizona State University&nbsp;infiltrated the Billy Graham&nbsp;<br>organization and reported on such advance preparations prior to one of his Crusade&nbsp;<br>visits: &quot;By the time Graham arrives&nbsp;in town&nbsp;and makes his altar call, an army&nbsp;of six&nbsp;<br>thousand wait with instructions on when to come&nbsp;forth at varying intervals to create the&nbsp;<br>impression of a spontaneous mass outpouring&quot; (Al-theide &amp; Johnson, 1977).&nbsp;<br>
Advertisers love to inform&nbsp;us when a product is the &quot;fastest-growing&quot; or &quot;largest-<br>selling&quot; because they don't have to convince&nbsp;us directly that the product is good; they&nbsp;<br>need only say that many others think so, which seems proof enough. The producers of&nbsp;<br>charity telethons devote inordinate amounts of&nbsp;time to the incessant listing of viewers&nbsp;<br>who have already pledged contributions.&nbsp;The message being communicated to the&nbsp;<br>holdouts is clear: &quot;Look at all the people who have decided to give. It&nbsp;<i>must&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>be the&nbsp;<br>correct thing to do.&quot; Certain nightclub owners manufacture a brand of visible social&nbsp;<br>proof for their clubs'&nbsp;quality by creating long&nbsp;waiting lines outside when&nbsp;there is plenty&nbsp;<br>of room&nbsp;inside. Salespeople are taught to spice their pitches with numerous accounts of&nbsp;<br>individuals who have purchased the product. Sales and motivation consultant Cavett&nbsp;<br>Robert captures the principle nicely in his advice to sales trainees: &quot;Since 95 percent of&nbsp;<br>the people are imitators and only 5 percent initiators, people are persuaded more by the&nbsp;<br>actions of others than by any proof we can offer.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Researchers, too, have employed procedures&nbsp;based on the principle of&nbsp;social proof—<br>sometimes with astounding results.1&nbsp;One psychologist in particular, Albert Bandura, has&nbsp;<br>led the way in developing such procedures to eliminate undesirable&nbsp;<br>
A program of investigation conducted&nbsp;by Kenneth Craig and&nbsp;his associates&nbsp;<br>demonstrates how the experience of pain can&nbsp;be affected&nbsp;by the principle of social&nbsp;<br>proof. In one study&nbsp;(Craig &amp; Prkachin, 1978),&nbsp;subjects who received&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of electric&nbsp;<br>shocks felt less pain (as indicated by self-reports, psychophysical measures of sensory&nbsp;<br>sensitivity, and such physiological responses&nbsp;as heart rate and skin conductivity) when&nbsp;<br>they were in the presence of another subject who was tolerating the shocks as if&nbsp;they&nbsp;<br>were not painful.&nbsp;<br>

behavior. Bandura and his colleagues have shown how people suffering from&nbsp;phobias&nbsp;<br>can be rid of these extreme fears in an amazingly simple fashion. For instance, in an&nbsp;<br>early study (Bandura, Grusec,&nbsp;&amp; Menlove, 1967), nursery-school-age children, chosen&nbsp;<br>because they were terrified of dogs,&nbsp;merely&nbsp;watched a little boy playing happily&nbsp;with&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>dog for 20 minutes a day. This exhibition produced such marked changed&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=112></a><i>Social Proof&nbsp;</i>103&nbsp;<br>
in the reactions of the fearful children that,&nbsp;after only four days, 67&nbsp;percent of them&nbsp;were&nbsp;<br>willing to climb into a playpen with a&nbsp;dog and remain confined there petting and&nbsp;<br>scratching the dog while everyone else left the room. Moreover, when the researchers&nbsp;<br>tested the children's fear levels again, one month later, they found that the improvement&nbsp;<br>had not diminished during&nbsp;that time; in fact, the children were&nbsp;more willing than ever&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>interact with dogs. An important practical discovery was made&nbsp;in a second study of&nbsp;<br>children who were exceptionally afraid of&nbsp;dogs (Bandura &amp; Menlove, 1968): To reduce&nbsp;<br>these children's fears, it was not necessary&nbsp;to provide live demonstrations of another&nbsp;<br>child playing with a dog; film&nbsp;clips had the&nbsp;same impact. The most effective clips were&nbsp;<br>those depicting a variety of other children&nbsp;interacting with their dogs. Apparently, the&nbsp;<br>principle of social proof works best when&nbsp;the proof is provided by the actions of many&nbsp;<br>other people.2&nbsp;<br>
The powerful influence of filmed examples in&nbsp;changing the behavior of children can be&nbsp;<br>used as therapy for various other problems.&nbsp;Some&nbsp;striking evidence is available in the&nbsp;<br>research of psychologist Robert O'Connor&nbsp;(1972) on socially withdrawn preschool&nbsp;<br>children. We have all seen children of this&nbsp;sort: terribly shy, standing alone at the&nbsp;<br>fringes of the games and groupings of their peers. O'Connor worried that this early&nbsp;<br>behavior was the beginning of what could&nbsp;become&nbsp;a&nbsp;long-term&nbsp;pattern of isolation,&nbsp;<br>which in turn could create persistent difficulties in social&nbsp;comfort and adjustment&nbsp;<br>throughout adulthood. In an attempt to reverse the pattern, O'Connor made a film&nbsp;<br>containing 11 different scenes in a nursery-school setting. Each scene began by showing&nbsp;<br>a different solitary child watching some&nbsp;social&nbsp;activity and then actively participating, to&nbsp;<br>everyone's enjoyment. O'Connor selected&nbsp;a group of the most severely withdrawn&nbsp;<br>children from&nbsp;four preschools&nbsp;and showed them this film. The impact was impressive.&nbsp;<br>After watching the film, the isolates immediately began to interact with their peers at a&nbsp;<br>level equal to that of the normal children&nbsp;in the schools. Even more astonishing was&nbsp;<br>what O'Connor found when he returned to&nbsp;the schools six weeks later to observe. While&nbsp;<br>the withdrawn children who had not seen O'Connor's film&nbsp;remained as isolated as ever,&nbsp;<br>those who&nbsp;<i>hod&nbsp;</i>viewed it were now leading their schools in amount of social activity. It&nbsp;<br>seems that this 23-minute movie, viewed&nbsp;<br>
Any reader who doubts that the seeming appropriateness of an action is importantly&nbsp;<br>influenced by the number of others performing it might try a small experiment. Stand on&nbsp;<br>a busy sidewalk, pick an empty spot in the sky or on a tall building, and stare at it for a&nbsp;<br>full minute. Very little will happen around you&nbsp;during that time—most people will walk&nbsp;<br>past without glancing up, and virtually no one&nbsp;will stop to stare with you. Now, on the&nbsp;<br>next day, go&nbsp;to the same&nbsp;Place and bring along four friends to look upward too. Within&nbsp;<br>60 seconds, a crowd of passers by will have&nbsp;stopped to crane their necks skyward with&nbsp;<br>the group. For those pedestrians who do not&nbsp;join you, the pressure to look up at least&nbsp;<br>briefly will be nearly irresistable; if the results of your experiment are like those of one&nbsp;<br>performed by three social psychologists in&nbsp;New York, you and your friends will cause&nbsp;<br>80 percent of&nbsp;all passersby to lift their gaze&nbsp;to your empty spot (Milgram, Bickman, &amp;&nbsp;<br>Berkowitz, 1969).&nbsp;<br>

just once, was enough to reverse a potential&nbsp;pattern of lifelong maladaptive behavior.&nbsp;<br>Such is the potency of the&nbsp;principle of social proof.3&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>After the Deluge</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
When it comes to illustrating the strength of&nbsp;social proof, there is one illustration that&nbsp;is&nbsp;<br>far and away my&nbsp;favorite. Several features&nbsp;account for its appeal: It offers&nbsp;a su-&nbsp;<br>
3Other research besides O'Connor's suggests&nbsp;that there are two sides to the filmed-<br>social-proof&nbsp;coin, however. The dramatic effect&nbsp;of filmed depictions on what children&nbsp;<br>find appropriate has been a source of great&nbsp;distress for those concerned with frequent&nbsp;<br>depictions of violence and aggression on television (Eron &amp; Huesmann, 1985).&nbsp;<br>Although the consequences of televised violence on the aggressive actions of children&nbsp;<br>are far from simple (Freedman, 1984), the data from&nbsp;a well-controlled experiment by&nbsp;<br>psychologists Robert Liebert and Robert&nbsp;Baron (1972) have an ominous look. Some&nbsp;<br>children were shown excerpts from&nbsp;a&nbsp;television program&nbsp;in which people intentionally&nbsp;<br>harmed each other. Afterward, these children&nbsp;acted in&nbsp;a significantly&nbsp;more&nbsp;harmful way&nbsp;<br>toward other children than did those who&nbsp;had watched a nonviolent television program&nbsp;<br>(a horse&nbsp;race). The finding that children act&nbsp;more aggressively toward one another after&nbsp;<br>seeing aggression on television held true for the&nbsp;two age groups tested (5- to 6- and 8- to&nbsp;<br>9-year-olds) and for both girls and boys.&nbsp;<br>

perb example of the much underused method of participant observation, in which a&nbsp;<br>scientist studies a&nbsp;process by becoming immersed in its natural occurrence; it provides&nbsp;<br>information of&nbsp;interest&nbsp;to such diverse&nbsp;groups as historians, psychologists, and&nbsp;<br>theologians; and, most important, it shows&nbsp;how social evidence can be used on us— not&nbsp;<br>by others,&nbsp;but by ourselves—to assure us that what we prefer to be true will seem&nbsp;to be&nbsp;<br>true.&nbsp;<br>
The story is an old one, requiring an examination of ancient&nbsp;data, for the past is dotted&nbsp;<br>with millennial religious&nbsp;movements. Various&nbsp;sects and cults have prophesied that&nbsp;on a&nbsp;<br>particular date there would arrive a period of redemption and great happiness for those&nbsp;<br>who believed in the group's teachings. In each instance it has been predicted&nbsp;that the&nbsp;<br>beginning of a time of salvation would be&nbsp;marked by an important and undeniable&nbsp;<br>event, usually the cataclysmic end of the&nbsp;world. Of course, these predictions have&nbsp;<br>invariably proved false, to the acute&nbsp;dismay of the members of such groups.&nbsp;<br>
However, immediately following the obvious failure of the prophecy,&nbsp;history records an&nbsp;<br>enigmatic pattern. Rather than disbanding in&nbsp;disillusion, the cultists often become&nbsp;<br>strengthened&nbsp;in their convictions. Risking the ridicule of the populace, they take to the&nbsp;<br>streets, publicly asserting their dogma and seeking converts&nbsp;with a&nbsp;fervor that is&nbsp;<br>intensified, not diminished, by&nbsp;the clear disconfirmation of&nbsp;a central belief. So it was&nbsp;<br>with the Montanists of second-century Turkey, with the Anabaptists of sixteenth-<br>century Holland, with the Sabbataists of&nbsp;seventeenth-century Izmir, and with the&nbsp;<br>Millerites of nineteenth-century America. And, thought a trio of interested social&nbsp;<br>scientists, so it might be with a doomsday cult based in modern-day Chicago. The&nbsp;<br>scientists—Leon Festinger, Henry&nbsp;Riecken, and Stanley Schachter—who were then&nbsp;<br>colleagues at the University of Minnesota,&nbsp;heard about the Chicago group and felt it&nbsp;<br>worthy of close study. Their decision to investigate by joining the group, incognito, as&nbsp;<br>new believers and by placing additional paid&nbsp;observers among its&nbsp;ranks resulted in a&nbsp;<br>remarkably rich firsthand account&nbsp;of the goings-on before and after the day of predicted&nbsp;<br>catastrophe (Festinger, Riecken, &amp; Schachter, 1964).&nbsp;<br>
The cult of believers was small, never numbering more than 30 members. Its leaders&nbsp;<br>were a middle-aged man and woman, whom&nbsp;for&nbsp;purposes of publication, the researchers&nbsp;<br>renamed Dr. Thomas Armstrong and Mrs. Marian Keech. Dr. Armstrong, a physician&nbsp;<br>on the staff of a college student-health service, had a long-held interest in mysticism,&nbsp;<br>the occult, and flying saucers;&nbsp;as such, he served as a respected&nbsp;authority&nbsp;on these&nbsp;<br>subjects for the group. Mrs. Keech,&nbsp;though, was the center of attention and activity.&nbsp;<br>Earlier in the year she had begun to receive messages from&nbsp;spiritual beings, whom&nbsp;she&nbsp;<br>called the Guardians, located on other planets. It was these messages, flowing through&nbsp;<br>Marian Keech's hand via the device of &quot;automatic writing,&quot; that formed the bulk&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>cult's religious belief system. The teachings&nbsp;of the Guardians were loosely linked&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>traditional Christian thought.&nbsp;<br>
The transmissions from the Guardians, always the subject of much discussion and&nbsp;<br>interpretation among the group, gained new significance when they began to foretell of&nbsp;<br>a great impending disaster—a flood that would begin in the Western Hemisphere and&nbsp;<br>eventually engulf the world. Although the cultists were understandably&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=115></a>106&nbsp;<i>Chapter 4</i>&nbsp;<br>
alarmed at first,&nbsp;further messages assured them&nbsp;that they&nbsp;and&nbsp;all those who believed in&nbsp;<br>the lessons sent through Mrs. Keech would survive. Before the calamity, spacemen&nbsp;<br>were to arrive and carry off the believers&nbsp;in&nbsp;flying saucers to a place of safety,&nbsp;<br>presumably on another planet. Very little detail was provided about&nbsp;the rescue except&nbsp;<br>that the believers were to make themselves ready for pickup by rehearsing certain&nbsp;<br>passwords to be exchanged (&quot;I&nbsp;left my hat at home.&quot; &quot;What&nbsp;is your question?&quot; &quot;I am&nbsp;my&nbsp;<br>own porter.&quot;) and by&nbsp;removing all metal from their clothes—because&nbsp;the wearing&nbsp;or&nbsp;<br>carrying of metal made saucer&nbsp;travel &quot;extremely dangerous.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
As Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter observed the preparations during the weeks prior&nbsp;<br>to the flood date, they noted with special&nbsp;interest two significant aspects of the&nbsp;<br>members'&nbsp;behavior. First, the level of commitment to the cult's belief&nbsp;system&nbsp;was very&nbsp;<br>high. In anticipation of their&nbsp;departure from&nbsp;doomed Earth, irrevocable steps were taken&nbsp;<br>by the group members. Most incurred the&nbsp;opposition of family and friends to their&nbsp;<br>beliefs but persisted,&nbsp;nonetheless, in their&nbsp;convictions, often when&nbsp;it meant losing&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>affections of these others. In fact, several of the members were threatened by neighbors&nbsp;<br>or family with legal actions designed to&nbsp;have them declared insane. Dr. Armstrong's&nbsp;<br>sister filed a motion to have his two younger children removed from his custody. Many&nbsp;<br>believers quit their jobs or neglected their&nbsp;studies to devote full time to the movement.&nbsp;<br>Some&nbsp;even gave or threw away their personal belongings, expecting&nbsp;them shortly to be&nbsp;<br>of no use. These were people whose certainty&nbsp;that they had the truth allowed them&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>withstand enormous social,&nbsp;economic, and legal pressures and whose commitment to&nbsp;<br>their dogma grew as they resisted each pressure.&nbsp;<br>
The second significant aspect of&nbsp;the believers'&nbsp;preflood actions was a curious form&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>inaction. For individuals so clearly convinced of&nbsp;the validity of their creed, they did&nbsp;<br>surprisingly little to spread&nbsp;the word. Although they initially publicized the news of the&nbsp;<br>coming disaster, they made no attempt to seek converts, to proselyte actively. They&nbsp;<br>were willing to sound the alarm&nbsp;and to counsel those who voluntarily responded to it,&nbsp;<br>but that was all.&nbsp;<br>
The group's distaste for recruitment efforts was evident in various ways besides the lack&nbsp;<br>of personal persuasion attempts. Secrecy&nbsp;was maintained&nbsp;in many matters— extra&nbsp;<br>copies of the lessons were burned, passwords&nbsp;and secret signs were instituted, the&nbsp;<br>contents of certain private tape&nbsp;recordings&nbsp;were not to be discussed with outsiders (so&nbsp;<br>secret were the tapes that even longtime believers were prohibited from&nbsp;taking notes of&nbsp;<br>them). Publicity was avoided. As the day of&nbsp;disaster approached, increasing numbers of&nbsp;<br>newspaper, television, and radio reporters&nbsp;converged on the group's headquarters in the&nbsp;<br>Keech house. For the most part, these people&nbsp;were turned away or ignored. The most&nbsp;<br>frequent answer to their questions was,&nbsp;&quot;No comment.&quot; Although discouraged for a&nbsp;<br>time, the media representatives returned with a vengeance when Dr. Armstrong's&nbsp;<br>religious activities caused him to be&nbsp;fired&nbsp;from&nbsp;his post on the college health service&nbsp;<br>staff;&nbsp;one especially persistent&nbsp;newsman had to be threatened&nbsp;with a&nbsp;lawsuit. A similar&nbsp;<br>siege was repelled on the eve of the flood when a swarm&nbsp;of reporters&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=116></a><i>Social Proof&nbsp;</i>107&nbsp;<br>
pushed and pestered the believers for&nbsp;information. Afterward, the researchers&nbsp;<br>summarized the group's preflood stance on&nbsp;public exposure and recruitment in&nbsp;<br>respectful tones: &quot;Exposed to a tremendous&nbsp;burst of publicity, they had made every&nbsp;<br>attempt to dodge fame; given dozens of opportunities to proselyte,&nbsp;they had remained&nbsp;<br>evasive and&nbsp;secretive and behaved with an almost superior indifference&quot; (Festinger et&nbsp;<br>al., 1964).&nbsp;<br>
Eventually, when all the reporters and would-be converts&nbsp;had been cleared from the&nbsp;<br>house, the believers began making their final preparations for the arrival of the&nbsp;<br>spaceship scheduled for midnight that night.&nbsp;The scene as viewed&nbsp;by Festinger,&nbsp;<br>Riecken, and Schachter must have seemed like absurdist theater. Otherwise ordinary&nbsp;<br>people—housewives, college students, a&nbsp;high-school boy, a publisher, a physician, a&nbsp;<br>hardware-store clerk and his mother—were participating earnestly in tragic comedy.&nbsp;<br>They took direction from&nbsp;a pair of members who were periodically&nbsp;in touch with the&nbsp;<br>Guardians; Marian&nbsp;Keech's written messages&nbsp;were being supplemented that evening&nbsp;by&nbsp;<br>&quot;the Bertha,&quot; a former beautician through&nbsp;whose tongue the &quot;Creator&quot; gave instruction.&nbsp;<br>They rehearsed their&nbsp;lines diligently, calling&nbsp;out in chorus the responses to be made&nbsp;<br>before entering the rescue saucer: &quot;I am&nbsp;my&nbsp;own porter.&quot; &quot;I am&nbsp;my&nbsp;own pointer.&quot; They&nbsp;<br>discussed seriously whether the message from&nbsp;a caller identifying himself as Captain&nbsp;<br>Video—a TV space character of the time—was properly interpreted as a prank or a&nbsp;<br>coded communication from&nbsp;their rescuers.&nbsp;<br>
In keeping&nbsp;with the admonition to carry&nbsp;nothing metallic aboard&nbsp;the saucer, the&nbsp;<br>believers wore clothing&nbsp;from&nbsp;which all metal pieces had&nbsp;been torn out. The metal&nbsp;<br>eyelets in their shoes had been ripped away.&nbsp;The women were braless or wore brassieres&nbsp;<br>whose metal stays had been removed. The men had yanked the zippers out of their&nbsp;<br>pants, which&nbsp;were supported by lengths of rope in&nbsp;place of belts.&nbsp;<br>
The group's fanaticism&nbsp;concerning the removal&nbsp;of all metal was vividly experienced by&nbsp;<br>one of the researchers who remarked, 25 minutes before midnight, that he had forgotten&nbsp;<br>to extract the zipper from&nbsp;his trousers.&nbsp;As the observers tell it, &quot;this knowledge&nbsp;<br>produced a near panic reaction. He was rushed into the bedroom&nbsp;where Dr. Armstrong,&nbsp;<br>his hands trembling and his eyes darting to&nbsp;the clock every few seconds, slashed out the&nbsp;<br>zipper with a razor blade and wrenched its clasps free with wire-cutters.&quot; The hurried&nbsp;<br>operation finished, the researcher was returned&nbsp;to the living room—a slightly less&nbsp;<br>metallic but,&nbsp;one supposes, much paler man.&nbsp;<br>
As the time appointed for their departure grew very close, the believers&nbsp;settled into a lull&nbsp;<br>of soundless anticipation. Luckily, the trained&nbsp;scientists gave a detailed account of the&nbsp;<br>events that transpired during this momentous period.&nbsp;<br>
<i>The last ten minutes were tense ones for the group in the living room. They had nothing&nbsp;<br>to do but sit and wait, their coats in their laps. In the tense silence two clocks ticked&nbsp;<br>loudly, one about ten minutes faster than the other. When the faster of the two pointed&nbsp;<br>to twelve-five, one of the observers remarked aloud on the fact. A chorus of people&nbsp;<br>replied that midnight had not&nbsp;yet come. Bob Eastman affirmed that the slower clock was&nbsp;</i><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=117></a><b>108&nbsp;</b><i>Chapter 4</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>correct; he had set it himself only that afternoon. It showed only four minutes before&nbsp;<br>midnight.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>These four minutes passed in complete silence except for a&nbsp;single utterance. When the&nbsp;<br>[slower]&nbsp;clock on the mantel showed only one&nbsp;minute remaining before the guide to the&nbsp;<br>saucer was due, Marian&nbsp;exclaimed in a strained, high-pitched voice: &quot;And not a plan&nbsp;<br>has gone astray!&quot; The clock chimed twelve, each stroke painfully clear in the expectant&nbsp;<br>hush. The believers sat motionless.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>One might have expected some visible reaction. Midnight had passed and nothing had&nbsp;<br>happened. The cataclysm itself was less than seven hours away. But there was little to&nbsp;<br>see in the reactions of the people in the room. There was no talking, no sound. People&nbsp;<br>sat stock-still, their faces seemingly frozen and expressionless. Mark Post war the only&nbsp;<br>person who even moved.&nbsp;He lay down on the sofa and closed his eyes but did not sleep.&nbsp;<br>Later, when spoken to, he answered monosyllabically but otherwise lay immobile. The&nbsp;<br>others showed nothing on the surface, although it&nbsp;became clear later that they had been&nbsp;<br>hit hard....</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>Gradually, painfully, an atmosphere of despair and confusion settled over the group.&nbsp;<br>They reexamined the prediction and the accompanying messages. Dr. Armstrong and&nbsp;<br>Mrs. Keech&nbsp;reiterated&nbsp;their faith. The believers mulled over their predicament and&nbsp;<br>discarded explanation after explanation as unsatisfactory. At&nbsp;one point, toward 4 A.M.,&nbsp;<br>Mrs. Keech broke down and cried bitterly. She&nbsp;knew, she sobbed, that there were some&nbsp;<br>who were beginning to doubt but that the group must beam light to those who needed it&nbsp;<br>most and that the group must hold together.&nbsp;The rest of the believers were losing their&nbsp;<br>composure, too. They were all visibly shaken&nbsp;and many were close to&nbsp;tears. It was now&nbsp;<br>almost 4:30 A.M. and still no way of handling the disconfirmation had been found. By&nbsp;<br>now, too, most of the group were talking openly about the failure of&nbsp;the escort to come&nbsp;<br>at midnight. The group seemed near dissolution.

In the midst of gathering doubt, as cracks crawled through the believers'&nbsp;confidence, the&nbsp;<br>researchers witnessed a pair of remarkable&nbsp;incidents, one after another. The first&nbsp;<br>occurred at about 4:45 A.M. when Marian&nbsp;Keech's hand suddenly&nbsp;began transcribing&nbsp;<br>through &quot;automatic writing&quot; the text of a&nbsp;holy message from&nbsp;above. When read aloud,&nbsp;<br>the communication proved to be an elegant&nbsp;explanation for the events of that night.&nbsp;<br>&quot;The little group, sitting alone all night long,&nbsp;had spread so much&nbsp;light that God had&nbsp;<br>saved the world from destruction.&quot; Although neat&nbsp;and efficient, this explanation was not&nbsp;<br>wholly satisfying by itself; for example, after hearing it, one member simply rose, put&nbsp;<br>on his hat and coat, and left, never to return. Something additional was needed to restore&nbsp;<br>the believers&nbsp;to their previous levels of faith.&nbsp;<br>

It was at this point that the second notable incident occurred to supply that need. Once&nbsp;<br>again, the words of those who were&nbsp;present offer a vivid description:&nbsp;<br>
<i>The atmosphere in the group changed abruptly and so did their behavior. Within&nbsp;<br>minutes after she had read the message explaining the disconfirmation, Mrs. Keech&nbsp;<br>received another message instructing her to publicize the explanation. She reached for&nbsp;<br>the telephone and began&nbsp;dialing the number of&nbsp;a newspaper. While she was waiting&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>be connected, someone asked: &quot;Marian, is this the first time you have called the&nbsp;<br>newspaper yourself?&quot; Her reply was immediate:&nbsp;&quot;Oh yes, this is the first time I have&nbsp;<br>ever called them. I have never had&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;tell them before, but now I feel it is&nbsp;<br>urgent.&quot; The whole group could have echoed her feelings, for they all felt a sense of&nbsp;<br>urgency. As soon as Marian had finished&nbsp;her call, the other members took turns&nbsp;<br>telephoning newspapers, wire service, radio stations, and national magazines to spread&nbsp;<br>the explanation of the failure of the flood. In&nbsp;their desire to spread the word quickly and&nbsp;<br>resoundingly, the believers now opened for public attention matters that had been thus&nbsp;<br>far utterly secret. Where only hours earlier they had shunned newspaper reporters and&nbsp;<br>felt that the attention they were getting in&nbsp;the press was painful, they now became avid&nbsp;<br>seekers for publicity. (Festinger et al.,&nbsp;1964, p. 170)</i>&nbsp;<br>
Not only had the long-standing policies&nbsp;concerning secrecy and publicity done an&nbsp;<br>about-face,&nbsp;so too had the group's attitude toward potential converts.&nbsp;Whereas likely&nbsp;<br>recruits who previously visited the house had been mostly ignored, turned away, or&nbsp;<br>treated with casual attention, the day following the disconfirmation saw a different&nbsp;<br>story. All callers were admitted, all questions were answered, attempts were made to&nbsp;<br>proselyte all such visitors. The members'&nbsp;unprecedented willingness to accommodate&nbsp;<br>new recruits was perhaps best demonstrated&nbsp;when nine high-school&nbsp;students arrived on&nbsp;<br>the following night to speak with Mrs. Keech.&nbsp;<br>
<i>They found her at the telephone deep in a discussion of flying saucers with a caller&nbsp;<br>whom, it later turned out, she&nbsp;believed to be a spaceman. Eager to continue talking to&nbsp;<br>him and at the same time anxious to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;her new guests, Marian simply included them&nbsp;<br>in the conversation and, for more than an hour, chatted alternately&nbsp;with her guests in&nbsp;<br>the living room and the &quot;spaceman &quot; on the other end of the telephone. So intent was&nbsp;<br>she on proselyting that she seemed unable to let&nbsp;any opportunity go by. (Festinger et al.,&nbsp;<br>1964, p. 178)</i>&nbsp;<br>
To what can we attribute the believers'&nbsp;radical turnabout?&nbsp;Within a few hours, they had&nbsp;<br>moved from clannish and taciturn hoarders of the Word to expansive and eager&nbsp;<br>

disseminators of it. What could have possessed them&nbsp;to choose such an ill-timed&nbsp;<br>instant—when the failure of the flood was&nbsp;likely to cause nonbelievers to view the&nbsp;<br>group and its dogma as laughable?&nbsp;<br>
The crucial event occurred sometime during &quot;the night of the flood&quot; when it became&nbsp;<br>increasingly&nbsp;clear that&nbsp;the prophecy would not be fulfilled. Oddly, it was not their prior&nbsp;<br>certainty&nbsp;that drove the members to propagate the faith, it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;encroaching sense of&nbsp;<br>uncertainty.&nbsp;It was&nbsp;the&nbsp;dawning realization&nbsp;that if the spaceship&nbsp;and flood predictions&nbsp;<br>were wrong, so might be the entire belief&nbsp;system&nbsp;on which they rested. For those&nbsp;<br>huddled in the Keech living room, that growing possibility must have seemed hideous.&nbsp;<br>
The group members had gone too far, given up&nbsp;too much for their beliefs to see them&nbsp;<br>destroyed; the shame, the economic cost, the mockery would be too great to bear. The&nbsp;<br>overarching need of the cultists&nbsp;to&nbsp;cling to&nbsp;those beliefs seeps poignantly from&nbsp;their own&nbsp;<br>words. From a young woman with a 3-year-old child:&nbsp;<br>
/&nbsp;<i>have to believe the flood&nbsp;is coming on the twenty-first because I've spent all my money.&nbsp;<br>I quit my job, I quit computer school. . . . I have to believe, (p. 168)</i>&nbsp;<br>
From&nbsp;Dr. Armstrong to one of the researchers four hours after&nbsp;the failure of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>saucermen to arrive:&nbsp;<br>
<i>I've had to go a long way. I've given up just&nbsp;about everything. I've&nbsp;cut every tie. I've&nbsp;<br>burned every bridge. I've turned my back on the world. I can't afford&nbsp;to doubt. I have to&nbsp;<br>believe. And there isn't any other truth, (p. 168)</i>&nbsp;<br>
Imagine the corner in which Dr. Armstrong and his followers found themselves as&nbsp;<br>morning approached. So&nbsp;massive was the commitment to their beliefs that no other truth&nbsp;<br>was tolerable. Yet that set of beliefs had just taken a merciless pounding from&nbsp;physical&nbsp;<br>reality: No saucer had landed, no spacemen had knocked, no flood had come, nothing&nbsp;<br>had happened as prophesied. Since the only acceptable form&nbsp;of truth had&nbsp;been undercut&nbsp;<br>by physical proof, there was but one way out of the corner for the group. It had to&nbsp;<br>establish another type of&nbsp;proof for the validity of&nbsp;its beliefs: social proof.&nbsp;<br>
This, then, explains their sudden shift&nbsp;from&nbsp;secretive conspirators to zealous&nbsp;<br>missionaries. It also explains the curious timing of the shift—precisely when a direct&nbsp;<br>disconfirmation of their beliefs had rendered them least convincing to outsiders. It was&nbsp;<br>necessary to risk the scorn and derision of the nonbelievers because publicity and&nbsp;<br>recruitment efforts provided the only remaining hope. If they could spread the Word, if&nbsp;<br>they could inform&nbsp;the uninformed, if&nbsp;they&nbsp;could persuade&nbsp;the&nbsp;skeptics, and if, by so&nbsp;<br>doing, they could win new converts, their&nbsp;threatened but treasured beliefs would&nbsp;<br>become&nbsp;<i>truer.&nbsp;</i>The principle of social proof says so:&nbsp;<i>The greater the number of people&nbsp;<br>who find any idea correct, the more a given&nbsp;individual will perceive the idea to be&nbsp;</i><br>

<i>correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>The group's assignment was clear; since&nbsp;the physical evidence could not be&nbsp;<br>changed, the social evidence had to be. Convince and ye shall be convinced.4&nbsp;<br>
<b>CAUSE OF&nbsp;DEATH: UNCERTAIN(TY)</b>&nbsp;<br>
All the weapons of influence discussed in&nbsp;this book work better under some&nbsp;conditions&nbsp;<br>than under others. If we are to defend ourselves adequately against any such weapon, it&nbsp;<br>is vital that we know its optimal operating conditions in order to recognize when we are&nbsp;<br>most vulnerable to its influence. We have&nbsp;already had a hint of one time when the&nbsp;<br>principle of social proof worked best with the&nbsp;Chicago&nbsp;believers. It was a sense of&nbsp;<br>shaken confidence that triggered their craving for converts. In general, when we are&nbsp;<br>unsure of ourselves, when the situation is&nbsp;unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty&nbsp;<br>reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of&nbsp;others as correct (Tesser,&nbsp;<br>Campbell, &amp; Mickler, 1983; Woolen &amp; Reed, 1998).&nbsp;<br>
In the process of examining the reactions&nbsp;of other people to resolve our uncertainty,&nbsp;<br>however, we are likely to overlook a subtle, but important fact: Those people are&nbsp;<br>probably examining the social evidence, too. Especially in an ambiguous situation, the&nbsp;<br>tendency for everyone to be looking to see what everyone else is doing can lead to a&nbsp;<br>fascinating phenomenon called&nbsp;<i>pluralistic ignorance.&nbsp;</i>A thorough understanding of the&nbsp;<br>pluralistic ignorance phenomenon helps explain a regular occurrence in our country that&nbsp;<br>has been termed both a riddle and a national&nbsp;disgrace: the failure&nbsp;of&nbsp;entire groups&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>bystanders to aid victims in agonizing need of help.&nbsp;<br>
The classic example of such bystander inaction and the one that has produced the most&nbsp;<br>debate in journalistic, political, and scientific&nbsp;circles began as an ordinary homicide case&nbsp;<br>in New York City's&nbsp;borough of Queens. A woman in her late twenties,&nbsp;<br>
Perhaps because of the quality of ragged desperation with which they approached their&nbsp;<br>task, the believers were wholly unsuccessful&nbsp;at enlarging their number. Not a single&nbsp;<br>convert was gained. At that point, in the face&nbsp;of the dual failures&nbsp;of physical and social&nbsp;<br>proof, the cult quickly&nbsp;disintegrated. Less&nbsp;than three weeks after the date of the&nbsp;<br>predicted flood, group members were scattered and maintained only sporadic&nbsp;<br>communication with one another. In one&nbsp;final—and ironic—disconfirmation of&nbsp;<br>prediction, it was the movement&nbsp;that perished in the flood.&nbsp;<br>
Ruin has not always been the fate of&nbsp;doomsday groups whose predictions proved&nbsp;<br>unsound, however. When such groups have been&nbsp;able to build social proof for their&nbsp;<br>beliefs through effective recruitment efforts, they have grown and prospered. For&nbsp;<br>example, when the Dutch Anabaptists saw their prophesied year of&nbsp;destruction, 1533,&nbsp;<br>pass uneventfully, they became rabid seekers after converts, pouring unprecedented&nbsp;<br>amounts of energy into the cause. One extraordinarily eloquent&nbsp;missionary, Jakob van&nbsp;<br>Kampen, is reported to have baptized 100 persons in a single day. So powerful was the&nbsp;<br>snowballing&nbsp;social evidence in support of the Anabaptist position&nbsp;that it rapidly&nbsp;<br>overwhelmed the disconfirming physical evidence and turned two-thirds of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>population of Holland's great&nbsp;cities into adherents.&nbsp;<br>

Catherine Genovese, was killed in&nbsp;a late-night attack&nbsp;on her street as she returned from&nbsp;<br>work. Murder is never an act to be passed off&nbsp;lightly, but in a city&nbsp;the size and tenor of&nbsp;<br>New York, the Genovese incident warranted no&nbsp;more space than a&nbsp;fraction of a column&nbsp;<br>in the<i>&nbsp;New York Times.&nbsp;</i>Catherine Genovese's story would have died with her on that&nbsp;<br>day in March 1964 if it hadn't been for a mistake.&nbsp;<br>
The metropolitan editor of the&nbsp;<i>Times,&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>A. M. Rosenthal, happened to be having lunch&nbsp;<br>with the city police commissioner a week later. Rosenthal asked the commissioner&nbsp;<br>about a different Queens-based homicide, and&nbsp;the commissioner, thinking he was being&nbsp;<br>questioned about the Genovese&nbsp;case, revealed something staggering that had been&nbsp;<br>uncovered by the police investigation. It was&nbsp;something that left&nbsp;everyone who heard it,&nbsp;<br>the commissioner included, aghast and grasping for explanations. Catherine Genovese&nbsp;<br>had not experienced a quick, muffled death. It had been a long, loud, tortured,&nbsp;<i>public&nbsp;<br></i>event. Her assailant had chased and attacked&nbsp;her&nbsp;in the street&nbsp;three times over a period&nbsp;<br>of 35 minutes before his knife finally silenced&nbsp;her cries for help. Incredibly, 38 of her&nbsp;<br>neighbors watched from&nbsp;the safety of their apartment windows without so much as&nbsp;<br>lifting a finger to call the&nbsp;police.&nbsp;<br>
Rosenthal, a former Pulitzer Prize winning reporter, knew a story&nbsp;when he heard one.&nbsp;<br>On the day of his lunch with the commissioner,&nbsp;he assigned a reporter to investigate the&nbsp;<br>&quot;bystander angle&quot; of the Genovese&nbsp;incident. Within a week, the&nbsp;<i>Times&nbsp;</i>published a long,&nbsp;<br>front-page article that was to create a swirl of controversy and speculation. The initial&nbsp;<br>paragraphs of that report provided&nbsp;the tone and focus of the story:&nbsp;<br>
<i>For more than half an hour 38 respectable,&nbsp;law-abiding citizens in Queens watched a&nbsp;<br>killer stalk and stab a woman in three separate attacks in Kew Gardens.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>Twice the sound of their voices and the sudden&nbsp;glow of their bedroom&nbsp;lights interrupted&nbsp;<br>him and frightened him off. Each time he returned, sought her out, and stabbed her&nbsp;<br>again. Not one person telephoned the police during the assault; one witness called after&nbsp;<br>the woman was dead.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>That was two weeks ago&nbsp;today. But Assistant&nbsp;Chief Inspector Frederick M. Lussen, in&nbsp;<br>charge of the borough's detectives and a veteran of 25 years of homicide investigations,&nbsp;<br>is still shocked.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>He can give a matter-of-fact recitation of&nbsp;many murders. But the Kew Gardens slaying&nbsp;<br>baffles him—not because it is a murder, but&nbsp;because &quot;good people&quot;&nbsp;failed to call the&nbsp;<br>police. (Ganzberg, 1964, p. 7)</i>&nbsp;<br>
As with Assistant Chief Inspector Lussen,&nbsp;shock and bafflement were the standard&nbsp;<br>reactions of&nbsp;almost everyone who learned the&nbsp;story's details. The shock struck first,&nbsp;<br>leaving the police, the newspeople, and&nbsp;the reading public stunned. The bafflement&nbsp;<br>followed quickly. How could 38 &quot;good people&quot;&nbsp;fail to act under those circumstances?&nbsp;<br>No one could understand it. Even the murder witnesses themselves were&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

bewildered. &quot;I don't know,&quot; they&nbsp;answered one after another.&nbsp;&quot;I just don't know.&quot; A few&nbsp;<br>offered weak reasons for their inaction. For example, two or three people explained that&nbsp;<br>they were &quot;afraid&quot; or &quot;did not want to&nbsp;get involved.&quot; These reasons, however, do not&nbsp;<br>stand up to close scrutiny: A simple anonymous call to the police could have saved&nbsp;<br>Catherine Genovese without threatening the witnesses'&nbsp;future safety or free time. No, it&nbsp;<br>wasn't&nbsp;the observers'&nbsp;fear or&nbsp;reluctance to&nbsp;complicate their lives that explained their lack&nbsp;<br>of action; something else was going on there that even they could not fathom.&nbsp;<br>
Confusion, though, does not make for good news&nbsp;copy. So the press as well as the other&nbsp;<br>media—several papers, TV stations, and&nbsp;magazines that were pursuing follow-up&nbsp;<br>stories—emphasized the only explanation&nbsp;available at&nbsp;the time: The&nbsp;witnesses,&nbsp;no&nbsp;<br>different from the rest of us, hadn't cared enough to get involved. Americans were&nbsp;<br>becoming a nation of&nbsp;selfish, insensitive people.&nbsp;The rigors of&nbsp;modern life, especially&nbsp;<br>city life, were hardening&nbsp;them. They were&nbsp;becoming &quot;The Cold&nbsp;Society,&quot; unfeeling and&nbsp;<br>indifferent to the plight of&nbsp;their fellow citizens.&nbsp;<br>
In support of this interpretation, news stories began appearing regularly in which&nbsp;<br>various kinds of public apathy were detailed. Also supporting such an interpretation&nbsp;<br>were the remarks of a range of armchair&nbsp;social commentators, who. as a breed, seem&nbsp;<br>never to admit to bafflement when speaking&nbsp;to the press. They, too, saw the Genovese&nbsp;<br>case as having large-scale social&nbsp;significance. All used the word&nbsp;<i>apathy,&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>which, it is&nbsp;<br>interesting to note, had been in&nbsp;the headline of the&nbsp;<i>Times's&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>front-page story, although&nbsp;<br>they accounted for the apathy differently. One attributed it to the effects of TV violence,&nbsp;<br>another to repressed aggressiveness, but most implicated&nbsp;the &quot;deper-sonalization&quot;&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>urban life with its &quot;megalopolitan societies&quot;&nbsp;and its &quot;alienation of&nbsp;the individual from&nbsp;<br>the group.&quot; Even Rosenthal, the newsman who first broke the story and who ultimately&nbsp;<br>made it the subject of a book, subscribed to the city-caused apathy theory.&nbsp;<br>
<i>Nobody can say why the 38 did not lift&nbsp;the phone while Miss Genovese was being&nbsp;<br>attacked, since they cannot say themselves.&nbsp;It can be assumed, however, that their&nbsp;<br>apathy was indeed one of the big-city variety. It is almost a matter of psychological&nbsp;<br>survival, if one is surrounded and pressed by millions of people, to&nbsp;prevent them from&nbsp;<br>constantly impinging on you, and the only way to&nbsp;do this is to ignore them as often as&nbsp;<br>possible. Indifference&nbsp;to one's neighbor and his troubles is a conditioned reflex in life in&nbsp;<br>New York as it is in other big cities. (A. M. Rosenthal, 1964, pp. 82-83)</i>&nbsp;<br>
As&nbsp;the&nbsp;Genovese&nbsp;story grew—aside from&nbsp;Rosenthal's book, it became the focus of&nbsp;<br>numerous newspaper and magazine pieces, several television&nbsp;news documentaries, and&nbsp;<br>an off-Broadway play—it attracted the professional attention of&nbsp;a pair of New York-<br>based psychology professors, Bibb Latane and John Darley (1968b). They examined the&nbsp;<br>reports of the Genovese incident and,&nbsp;on the basis of their knowledge of&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<a name=123></a>114&nbsp;<i>chapter 4</i>&nbsp;<br>
social psychology, hit on what had seemed like the most unlikely explanation of all—&nbsp;<br>the fact that 38 witnesses were present. Previous accounts of the story had invariably&nbsp;<br>emphasized that no action was taken,&nbsp;<i>even&nbsp;though&nbsp;</i>38 individuals had looked on. Latane&nbsp;<br>and Darley suggested that&nbsp;no one had helped precisely&nbsp;<i>because&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>there were so many&nbsp;<br>observers.&nbsp;<br>
The psychologists speculated that, for at least two reasons, a bystander to an emergency&nbsp;<br>will be unlikely to help&nbsp;when there&nbsp;are a number of&nbsp;other bystanders present. The first&nbsp;<br>reason is fairly straightforward.&nbsp;<i>With several potential helpers around, the personal&nbsp;<br>responsibility of each&nbsp;individual is reduced:&nbsp;</i>&quot;Perhaps someone else will give or call for&nbsp;<br>aid, perhaps someone else already has.&quot; So&nbsp;with everyone thinking&nbsp;that someone else&nbsp;<br>will help or&nbsp;has helped,&nbsp;no one does. The second reason is&nbsp;the more psychologically&nbsp;<br>intriguing one; it is founded&nbsp;on the principle of social proof&nbsp;and involves the pluralistic&nbsp;<br>ignorance effect Very often an emergency is not obviously an emergency. Is the man&nbsp;<br>lying in the alley&nbsp;a heart-attack victim&nbsp;or&nbsp;a drunk sleeping one off? Is the commotion&nbsp;<br>next door an assault requiring the police or&nbsp;an especially loud marital spat where&nbsp;<br>intervention would be inappropriate and&nbsp;unwelcome?&nbsp;What&nbsp;is going on?&nbsp;In times of&nbsp;<br>such uncertainty, the natural tendency is&nbsp;to look around at the actions of others for&nbsp;<br>clues. We&nbsp;can learn from&nbsp;the way the other&nbsp;witnesses are reacting whether the event is&nbsp;<br>or is not an emergency.&nbsp;<br>
What is easy to forget, though, is&nbsp;that everybody else observing&nbsp;the event is likely to be&nbsp;<br>looking for social evidence, too. Because we all prefer to appear poised and unflustered&nbsp;<br>among others, we are likely to search for that&nbsp;evidence placidly, with brief, camouflaged&nbsp;<br>glances at those around us. Therefore everyone is likely to&nbsp;see everyone else looking&nbsp;<br>unruffled and failing&nbsp;to&nbsp;act. As a result, and&nbsp;by&nbsp;the principle of&nbsp;social&nbsp;proof, the event&nbsp;<br>will be roundly interpreted as a nonemergency. This, according to Latane and Darley&nbsp;<br>(1968b) is the state of pluralistic ignorance &quot;in which each&nbsp;person decided that since&nbsp;<br>nobody is concerned, nothing is wrong. Meanwhile, the danger may be mounting to the&nbsp;<br>point where a single individual, uninfluenced by the seeming calm&nbsp;of others,&nbsp;<i>would&nbsp;<br></i>react.&quot;5&nbsp;<br>
5The potentially tragic consequences of&nbsp;the pluralistic&nbsp;ignorance phenomenon are&nbsp;<br>starkly illustrated in a UPI&nbsp;news release from&nbsp;Chicago:&nbsp;<br>
A&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>university coed was beaten and strangled in&nbsp;daylight hours near one of the most&nbsp;<br>popular tourist attractions in&nbsp;the city, police said Saturday.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>The nude body of Lee Alexis&nbsp;Wilson, 23, was found Friday in&nbsp;dense shrubbery alongside&nbsp;<br>the wall of&nbsp;the Art Institute by a&nbsp;12-year-old boy playing in the bushes.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>Police theorized she may have been sitting&nbsp;or standing by a fountain in the Art&nbsp;<br>Institute's south plaza when she was attacked. The assailant apparently then dragged&nbsp;<br>her into the bushes. She apparently was sexually assaulted, police said.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>Police said thousands of persons must have&nbsp;passed the site and one man told them he&nbsp;<br>heard a scream about 2 P.M. but did not investigate because no one else seemed to be&nbsp;<br>paying attention.</i>&nbsp;<br>

<i><b>A Scientific Approach</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
The fascinating upshot of Latane and Darley's reasoning&nbsp;is that,&nbsp;for an emergency&nbsp;<br>victim, the idea of &quot;safety in numbers&quot; may often be completely wrong. It might be that&nbsp;<br>someone in need of emergency aid would have&nbsp;a better chance of survival if a single&nbsp;<br>bystander, rather than a crowd, were present.&nbsp;To test this unusual&nbsp;thesis, Darley, Latane,&nbsp;<br>their students, and&nbsp;colleagues performed a systematic and impressive program&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>research that produced a clear set of findings (for a review, see Latane &amp; Nida, 1981).&nbsp;<br>Their basic procedure was to stage emergency events that were observed&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=125></a>116&nbsp;<i>Chapter 4</i>&nbsp;<br>
by a single individual or by a group of people. They then recorded the number of times&nbsp;<br>the emergency victim&nbsp;received help under those&nbsp;circumstances. In their first experiment&nbsp;<br>(Darley &amp; Latane, 1968), a New&nbsp;York college student&nbsp;who appeared&nbsp;to be having&nbsp;an&nbsp;<br>epileptic&nbsp;seizure received&nbsp;help 85 percent of&nbsp;the time when there was a single bystander&nbsp;<br>present but only 31 percent of time&nbsp;with five&nbsp;bystanders present. With almost all the&nbsp;<br>single bystanders helping, it becomes difficult to argue that ours is &quot;The Cold Society&quot;&nbsp;<br>where no one cares for suffering others. Obviously it was something about the presence&nbsp;<br>of other bystanders that reduced&nbsp;helping to shameful levels.&nbsp;<br>
Other studies have examined the importance of social proof in&nbsp;causing widespread&nbsp;<br>witness &quot;apathy.&quot; They have done so by planting within a group&nbsp;of witnesses to a&nbsp;<br>possible emergency people who are rehearsed&nbsp;to act as if no emergency were occurring.&nbsp;<br>For instance, in another New York-based&nbsp;experiment (Latane &amp; Darley, 1968a), 75&nbsp;<br>percent of lone individuals who observed&nbsp;smoke seeping from under a door reported the&nbsp;<br>leak; however, when similar leaks were&nbsp;observed by three-person groups, the smoke&nbsp;<br>was reported only 38 percent of&nbsp;the time. The smallest number of bystanders took&nbsp;<br>action, though, when the three-person groups included two&nbsp;individuals who had been&nbsp;<br>coached to ignore the smoke; under those conditions, the leaks were reported only 10&nbsp;<br>percent of time. In a similar study conducted in Toronto (A. S. Ross, 1971), single&nbsp;<br>bystanders provided emergency aid 90 percent&nbsp;of the time, whereas&nbsp;such aid occurred in&nbsp;<br>only 16 percent of the cases&nbsp;when a bystander was in the presence of two passive&nbsp;<br>bystanders.&nbsp;<br>
Social scientists now have&nbsp;a good idea of when bystanders&nbsp;will offer emergency aid.&nbsp;<br>First, and contrary to the&nbsp;view that we have become&nbsp;a society of callous, uncaring&nbsp;<br>people, once witnesses are convinced that an&nbsp;emergency situation exists, aid is very&nbsp;<br>likely. Under these conditions, the number&nbsp;of&nbsp;bystanders who either&nbsp;intervene&nbsp;<br>themselves or summon help is quite comforting. For example, in four separate&nbsp;<br>experiments done in Florida (R. D. Clark &amp; Word, 1972, 1974), accident scenes&nbsp;<br>involving a maintenance man were staged. When it was clear that the man was hurt and&nbsp;<br>required assistance, he was helped 100 percent&nbsp;of the time&nbsp;in two of the experiments. In&nbsp;<br>the other two experiments, where helping involved contact with potentially dangerous&nbsp;<br>electric wires, the victim still received&nbsp;bystander aid in 90 percent&nbsp;of&nbsp;the instances. In&nbsp;<br>addition, these extremely high levels of assistance occurred whether the witnesses&nbsp;<br>observed the event singly or in groups.&nbsp;<br>
The situation becomes very different when,&nbsp;as in many cases, bystanders cannot be sure&nbsp;<br>that the event they are witnessing is an emergency. Then a victim&nbsp;is much&nbsp;more likely to&nbsp;<br>be helped by a lone bystander than by a group, especially if&nbsp;the people in the group are&nbsp;<br>strangers to one another (Latane &amp; Rodin, 1969). It seems that the pluralistic ignorance&nbsp;<br>effect is strongest among strangers: Because&nbsp;we like to look&nbsp;graceful and sophisticated&nbsp;<br>in public and because&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;unfamiliar with&nbsp;the reactions of&nbsp;those we do&nbsp;not know, we&nbsp;<br>are unlikely to give off or correctly read&nbsp;expressions of concern when in a group of&nbsp;<br>strangers. Therefore, a possible emergency is viewed as&nbsp;a nonemergency and a victim&nbsp;<br>suffers.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<a name=126></a><i>Social Proof&nbsp;</i>117&nbsp;<br>
A close look at this&nbsp;set of research&nbsp;findings reveals an enlightening pattern. All the&nbsp;<br>conditions that decrease an emergency victim's chances for bystander aid exist normally&nbsp;<br>and innocently in the city, in&nbsp;contrast to rural areas:&nbsp;<br>
1. Cities are more clamorous, distracting, rapidly&nbsp;changing places where it is difficult to&nbsp;<br>be certain of&nbsp;the nature of&nbsp;the events one encounters.&nbsp;<br>
2. Urban environments are more populous; consequently, people are more likely to be&nbsp;<br>with others when witnessing a&nbsp;potential emergency situation.&nbsp;<br>
3. City dwellers know a much&nbsp;smaller percentage of fellow residents than do people&nbsp;<br>who live in small towns; therefore, city dwellers are more likely to&nbsp;find themselves in a&nbsp;<br>group of strangers when observing an emergency.&nbsp;<br>
These three natural characteristics of urban environments—their confusion, their&nbsp;<br>populousness, and their low levels of acquaintanceship—fit in very well with the factors&nbsp;<br>shown by research to decrease&nbsp;bystander aid. Without ever having to&nbsp;resort to such&nbsp;<br>sinister concepts as &quot;urban&nbsp;depersonalization&quot; and &quot;megalopolitan alienation,&quot; then, we&nbsp;<br>can explain why so many&nbsp;instances of bystander inaction occur in our cities.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Devictimizing Yourself</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Explaining the dangers of modern urban life&nbsp;in less ominous terms does not dispel them.&nbsp;<br>Furthermore, as the world's populations move&nbsp;increasingly to the cities—half of all&nbsp;<br>humanity will be city&nbsp;dwellers within&nbsp;a decade—there will be a growing&nbsp;need to&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;<br>those dangers. Fortunately, our newfound understanding of the bystander &quot;apathy&quot;&nbsp;<br>process offers real hope. Armed with this&nbsp;scientific knowledge, an emergency victim&nbsp;<br>can increase enormously the chances of receiving aid from&nbsp;others. The key is the&nbsp;<br>realization that groups&nbsp;of bystanders fail to help because the bystanders are unsure&nbsp;<br>rather than unkind. They don't help because they are unsure an emergency actually&nbsp;<br>exists and whether they are&nbsp;responsible for taking action. When they are sure of their&nbsp;<br>responsibilities for intervening in a clear emergency, people are exceedingly responsive!&nbsp;<br>Once it is understood that the enemy is the&nbsp;simple state of uncertainty, it becomes&nbsp;<br>possible for emergency victims to reduce this uncertainty,&nbsp;thereby protecting&nbsp;<br>themselves. Imagine, for example, you are spending a summer afternoon at a music&nbsp;<br>concert in a park. As the concert ends and people begin leaving, you notice a slight&nbsp;<br>numbness in one arm&nbsp;but dismiss it as nothing to be alarmed about. Yet, while moving&nbsp;<br>with the crowd to the&nbsp;distant parking areas, you&nbsp;feel the numbness spreading down to&nbsp;<br>your hand and up one side of your face. Feeling&nbsp;disoriented,&nbsp;you decide to sit against a&nbsp;<br>tree for a moment to rest. Soon you realize&nbsp;that something is drastically wrong. Sitting&nbsp;<br>down has not helped; in fact, the control and coordination of your muscles has&nbsp;<br>worsened, and you are starting to have difficulty moving your&nbsp;mouth and tongue to&nbsp;<br>speak. You try to get up but can't. A terrifying thought rushes to&nbsp;mind: &quot;Oh, God, I'm&nbsp;<br>having a stroke!&quot; Groups of people are passing by and most are paying no attention. The&nbsp;<br>few who notice the odd way you are slumped against the tree or the&nbsp;<br>

strange look on your face check the social evidence around&nbsp;them&nbsp;and, seeing that no one&nbsp;<br>else is reacting with concern, walk&nbsp;on convinced that nothing is wrong.&nbsp;<br>
Were you to find yourself in such a predicament, what could you do to overcome the&nbsp;<br>odds against receiving help?&nbsp;Because your physical abilities would be deteriorating,&nbsp;<br>time would be crucial.&nbsp;If, before you could summon aid, you lost your speech or&nbsp;<br>mobility or consciousness, your chances for&nbsp;assistance and for recovery&nbsp;would plunge&nbsp;<br>drastically. It would be essential to try to&nbsp;request help quickly. What would be the most&nbsp;<br>effective form&nbsp;of that request? Moans, groans, or outcries probably would not do. They&nbsp;<br>might bring you some&nbsp;attention, but they&nbsp;would not provide enough information to&nbsp;<br>assure passersby that a true emergency existed. If mere outcries are unlikely to&nbsp;produce&nbsp;<br>help from&nbsp;the passing crowd, perhaps you should be more specific. Indeed, you need to&nbsp;<br>do more than try to gain attention; you should call out clearly your need for assistance.&nbsp;<br>You must not allow bystanders to define&nbsp;your situation as a nonemergency. Use the&nbsp;<br>word &quot;Help&quot; to show your need for emergency aid, and don't&nbsp;worry about being wrong.&nbsp;<br>Embarrassment is a villain to be crushed.&nbsp;If you think you are having a stroke, you&nbsp;<br>cannot afford to be worried about the possibility of overestimating your problem. The&nbsp;<br>difference is that between a moment of embarrassment and possible death or lifelong&nbsp;<br>paralysis.&nbsp;<br>
Even a resounding call for help is not your most effective tactic. Although it may reduce&nbsp;<br>bystanders'&nbsp;doubts that a real emergency exists, it will not remove&nbsp;several other&nbsp;<br>important uncertainties within each onlooker's mind: What&nbsp;kind of aid is required?&nbsp;<br>Should I be the one to provide the aid, or&nbsp;should someone more qualified do it? Has&nbsp;<br>someone else akeady gone to get professional help, or is it my responsibility?&nbsp;While the&nbsp;<br>bystanders stand gawking at you and grappling with these questions, time vital to your&nbsp;<br>survival could he slipping away.&nbsp;<br>
Clearly, then, as a victim&nbsp;you must&nbsp;do more&nbsp;than alert bystanders&nbsp;to your need for&nbsp;<br>emergency assistance; you must also remove their uncertainties about how that&nbsp;<br>assistance should be provided and who should provide it. What would be the most&nbsp;<br>efficient and&nbsp;reliable way to do so?&nbsp;<br>
Based on the research findings we have seen, my advice would be to isolate one&nbsp;<br>individual from&nbsp;the crowd: Stare, speak, and point directly at that person and no one&nbsp;<br>else: &quot;You,&nbsp;sir,&nbsp;in&nbsp;the blue jacket, I need help. Call an ambulance.&quot; With that one&nbsp;<br>utterance you would dispel all the uncertainties that might prevent or delay help. With&nbsp;<br>that one statement you will have put the man in&nbsp;the blue jacket in the role of &quot;rescuer.&quot;&nbsp;<br>He should now understand that emergency aid&nbsp;is needed; he should understand that he,&nbsp;<br>not someone else, is responsible for providing the aid; and, finally, he should&nbsp;<br>understand exactly how to provide it. All the scientific evidence indicates that the result&nbsp;<br>should be quick, effective assistance.&nbsp;<br>
In general, then, your best strategy when in&nbsp;need of emergency help is to reduce the&nbsp;<br>uncertainties of those around you concerning your condition and their responsibilities.&nbsp;<br>Be as precise as possible about your need for aid. Do not&nbsp;allow bystanders to come&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>their own conclusions&nbsp;because, especially in&nbsp;a crowd, the principle of social proof and&nbsp;<br>the consequent pluralistic ignorance effect might well cause them&nbsp;to A,&nbsp;<br>

view your situation as a nonemergency. Of all the techniques in this book designed to&nbsp;<br>produce compliance with a request,&nbsp;this one is the most important&nbsp;to remember. After&nbsp;<br>all, the failure of your request for&nbsp;emergency aid could mean your life.&nbsp;<br>
<b>READER'S&nbsp;REPORT 4.1</b>&nbsp;<br>
<b>From a Woman Living in Wroclaw, Poland</b>&nbsp;<br>
I was going through a well-lighted road crossing when I thought I saw somebody fall&nbsp;<br>into a ditch left by workers. The ditch was well protected, and I was not&nbsp;sure if I really&nbsp;<br>saw it—maybe it was just imagination. One&nbsp;year ago, I would continue on my way,&nbsp;<br>believing that people who had been closer&nbsp;saw better. But I had read your book. So, I&nbsp;<br>stopped and returned to check if it was true. And it was. A man fell into this hole and&nbsp;<br>was lying there shocked. The ditch was quite deep, so people walking nearby couldn't&nbsp;<br>see anything. When I tried to do something, two guys walking on this street stopped to&nbsp;<br>help me pull the man out.&nbsp;<br>
Today, the newspapers wrote that during the&nbsp;last three weeks of winter, 120 people died&nbsp;<br>in Poland, frozen. This guy could have been&nbsp;121—that night the temperature was -21C.&nbsp;<br>
He should be grateful to&nbsp;your book that he is alive.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Author's note:&nbsp;</b>Several years ago, I was involved&nbsp;in a rather serious automobile&nbsp;<br>accident that occurred at an intersection. Both I and the other driver were hurt: He was&nbsp;<br>slumped, unconscious, over&nbsp;his steering wheel while I&nbsp;had staggered, bloody, from&nbsp;<br>behind mine. Cars began to roll slowly past&nbsp;us; their&nbsp;drivers gawked&nbsp;but did not stop.&nbsp;<br>Like the Polish woman, I had read the book, too; so, I knew what to&nbsp;do. I pointed&nbsp;<br>directly at the driver of one&nbsp;car: &quot;Call the police.&quot; To&nbsp;a second and third driver: &quot;Pull&nbsp;<br>over, we need help.&quot; Not only was their aid rapid,&nbsp;it was infectious. More drivers began&nbsp;<br>stopping</i>—<i>spontaneously</i>—<i>to tend&nbsp;to the other victim. The principle of&nbsp;social proof was&nbsp;<br>working&nbsp;</i>for&nbsp;<i>us now. The trick had been to get the ball rolling in the direction of help.&nbsp;<br>Once that was accomplished, social proof's natural momentum did the rest.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<b>MONKEY ME, MONKEY DO</b>&nbsp;<br>
A bit earlier I stated that the principle of social proof, like all other weapons of&nbsp;<br>influence, works better under some&nbsp;conditions than under others. We have already&nbsp;<br>explored one of those conditions: uncertainty. Without&nbsp;question, when people are&nbsp;<br>uncertain, they are more likely to use others'&nbsp;actions to decide how they themselves&nbsp;<br>should act. In addition,&nbsp;there is another important working condition:&nbsp;similarity. The&nbsp;<br>principle of social proof operates most powerfully when we are observing the behavior&nbsp;<br>of people just like us (Festinger, 1954). It is the conduct of&nbsp;such people that gives us the&nbsp;<br>greatest insight into what&nbsp;constitutes correct behavior for ourselves. Therefore,&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=129></a>120&nbsp;<i>Chapter 4</i>&nbsp;<br>
we are more inclined&nbsp;to follow the&nbsp;lead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar individual than a dissimilar one&nbsp;<br>(Abrams, Wetherell, Cochrane, Hogg, &amp;&nbsp;Turner, 1990; Burn, 1991; Schultz, 1999).&nbsp;<br>
That is&nbsp;why I believe&nbsp;we are seeing an&nbsp;increasing number of average-person-on-the-<br>street testimonials on TV&nbsp;these days. Advertisers now know that one successful way to&nbsp;<br>sell a product to ordinary viewers (who compose the largest potential&nbsp;market) is to&nbsp;<br>demonstrate that other &quot;ordinary&quot; people like&nbsp;and use it. Whether the product is a brand&nbsp;<br>of soft drink or a pain reliever or a laundry detergent, we&nbsp;hear volleys of praise from&nbsp;<br>John or Mary Everyperson.&nbsp;<br>
More compelling evidence for the importance of&nbsp;similarity&nbsp;in determining whether&nbsp;we&nbsp;<br>will imitate&nbsp;another's behavior comes from&nbsp;scientific research. An especially apt&nbsp;<br>illustration can be found in a study done by psychologists at Columbia University&nbsp;<br>(Hornstein, Fisch, &amp; Holmes, 1968). The researchers placed wallets on the ground in&nbsp;<br>various locations around midtown Manhattan to observe what&nbsp;would happen when they&nbsp;<br>were found. Each wallet contained&nbsp;$2.00 in cash, a $26.30 check, and various&nbsp;<br>information providing&nbsp;the name and address&nbsp;of&nbsp;the wallet's &quot;owner.&quot; In&nbsp;addition&nbsp;to&nbsp;these&nbsp;<br>items, the wallet also&nbsp;contained&nbsp;a letter&nbsp;making&nbsp;it evident that the wallet had been&nbsp;lost&nbsp;<br>not once, but twice. The&nbsp;letter was written&nbsp;to the wallet's owner from&nbsp;a man who had&nbsp;<br>found it earlier and whose&nbsp;intention was to return it. The&nbsp;finder indicated in his letter&nbsp;<br>that he was happy to help and that the chance&nbsp;to be of service in this way had made him&nbsp;<br>feel good.&nbsp;<br>
It was evident to anyone who found one of&nbsp;these wallets&nbsp;that this well-intentioned&nbsp;<br>individual had then lost the wallet himself on the way to the mailbox—the wallet was&nbsp;<br>wrapped in an envelope addressed to the owner. The researchers wanted to know how&nbsp;<br>many people finding such a wallet would follow&nbsp;the lead of&nbsp;the first finder and mail it,&nbsp;<br>intact, to the original owner. Before they&nbsp;dropped the wallets, however, the researchers&nbsp;<br>varied one feature of the letter it contained. Some of&nbsp;the letters were written in standard&nbsp;<br>English by someone who seemed to be an&nbsp;average American, while the other letters&nbsp;<br>were written&nbsp;in broken English by&nbsp;the first&nbsp;finder, who identified himself as a recently&nbsp;<br>arrived foreigner. In other words, the person who had initially&nbsp;found the wallet and had&nbsp;<br>tried to return it was depicted by the letter as being either similar or dissimilar to most&nbsp;<br>Americans.&nbsp;<br>
The interesting question was whether the people who found the wallet and letter would&nbsp;<br>be more influenced to mail the wallet if&nbsp;the first person who had&nbsp;tried to do so were&nbsp;<br>similar to them. The answer was plain: Only&nbsp;33&nbsp;percent of the wallets&nbsp;were returned&nbsp;<br>when the first finder was seen to be dissimilar, but 70 percent were returned when he&nbsp;<br>was thought to be a similar other. These results suggest an important&nbsp;qualification of the&nbsp;<br>principle of&nbsp;social&nbsp;proof. We will use&nbsp;the actions of&nbsp;others to decide on proper behavior&nbsp;<br>for ourselves,&nbsp;<i>especially when we view those others to be similar to ourselves.</i>&nbsp;<br>
This tendency applies not only to adults but to children as well. Health researchers have&nbsp;<br>found, for example, that a school-based antismoking program&nbsp;had lasting effects only&nbsp;<br>when it used same-age peer leaders as&nbsp;teachers (Murray, Leup-ker, Johnson, &amp;&nbsp;<br>Mittlemark, 1984). Another study found that children who saw a&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=130></a><i>Social Proof&nbsp;</i>121&nbsp;<br>
film depicting a child's positive visit to the&nbsp;dentist lowered their own dental anxieties&nbsp;<br>principally when they were the same&nbsp;age as&nbsp;the child in the film (Melamed, Yurcheson,&nbsp;<br>Fleece, Hutcherson, &amp; Hawes, 1978).&nbsp;I wish I had&nbsp;known about this second&nbsp;study when,&nbsp;<br>a few years before it was published, I was trying to reduce a different kind of anxiety in&nbsp;<br>my son, Chris.&nbsp;<br>
I live in Arizona where backyard swimming pools abound. Regrettably, each year,&nbsp;<br>several young children drown after falling into&nbsp;an unattended pool. I was determined,&nbsp;<br>therefore, to&nbsp;teach Chris&nbsp;how to swim&nbsp;at an&nbsp;early age. The problem&nbsp;was not that he was&nbsp;<br>afraid of the water; he loved it, but he would not get into the pool without wearing his&nbsp;<br>inflatable inner tube, no&nbsp;matter how I tried to&nbsp;coax, talk, or shame&nbsp;him&nbsp;out of it. After&nbsp;<br>getting nowhere for two months, I hired a graduate student of mine to help. Despite his&nbsp;<br>background as a lifeguard and swimming instructor, he failed as I had. He couldn't&nbsp;<br>persuade Chris to attempt even a stroke outside of his plastic ring. About this time,&nbsp;<br>Chris was attending a day camp that provided a number of activities to its group,&nbsp;<br>including the use of a large&nbsp;pool, which he scrupulously avoided. One day, shortly after&nbsp;<br>the graduate student incident, I went to get&nbsp;Chris from&nbsp;camp&nbsp;and, with my&nbsp;mouth agape,&nbsp;<br>watched him run down the diving board and jump&nbsp;into the deepest part of the pool.&nbsp;<br>Panicked, I began pulling&nbsp;off&nbsp;my shoes to jump&nbsp;in to his rescue when I saw him&nbsp;bob to&nbsp;<br>the surface and paddle safely to the side of&nbsp;the pool— where I dashed, shoes in hand, to&nbsp;<br>meet him.&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Chris, you&nbsp;can swim!&quot; I&nbsp;said excitedly. &quot;You&nbsp;can swim!&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; he responded casually, &quot;I&nbsp;<br>learned how today.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&quot;This is terrific! This is just terrific,&quot; I burbled, gesturing expansively to&nbsp;convey&nbsp;my&nbsp;enthusiasm.&nbsp;<br>&quot;But, how come you&nbsp;didn't need&nbsp;your&nbsp;plastic ring today?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Looking somewhat embarrassed because his father&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;be raving while inexplicably&nbsp;<br>soaking his socks in a small puddle and&nbsp;waving his shoes around, Chris explained:&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Well, I'm 3&nbsp;years old, and Tommy&nbsp;is&nbsp;3 years old. And Tommy&nbsp;can swim&nbsp;without a ring, so that&nbsp;<br>means I can, too.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
I could have kicked myself. Of course it would be&nbsp;<i>to little Tommy,&nbsp;</i>not to a 6'2&quot; graduate&nbsp;<br>student, that Chris would look for the most relevant information about what he could or&nbsp;<br>should do. Had I been more thoughtful about&nbsp;solving Chris'&nbsp;swimming problem, I could&nbsp;<br>have employed Tommy's&nbsp;good example earlier&nbsp;and, perhaps, saved&nbsp;myself a couple of&nbsp;<br>frustrating months. I could have simply&nbsp;noted at the day camp that Tommy was a&nbsp;<br>swimmer and then arranged with his parents for the boys to spend a weekend afternoon&nbsp;<br>swimming in our pool. My guess is that Chris'&nbsp;plastic ring would have been abandoned&nbsp;<br>by the end of the day.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Monkey Die</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Any factor that can spur 70&nbsp;percent of&nbsp;New Yorkers to&nbsp;return&nbsp;a wallet, with all its&nbsp;<br>contents included, must be considered impressive. Yet the outcome&nbsp;of&nbsp;the lost-wallet&nbsp;<br>study offers just a hint of&nbsp;the immense impact that the conduct of similar others has&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=131></a>122&nbsp;<i>Chapter 4</i>&nbsp;<br>
on human behavior. More powerful examples exist in addition&nbsp;to this one. To my&nbsp;mind,&nbsp;<br>the most telling illustration of&nbsp;this impact starts with a&nbsp;seemingly nonsensical statistic:&nbsp;<br>After a suicide has made front-page news,&nbsp;airplanes—private planes,&nbsp;corporate jets,&nbsp;<br>airliners—begin falling out of&nbsp;the sky at an alarming rate.&nbsp;<br>
For example, it has been shown (Phillips,&nbsp;1979) that immediately following certain&nbsp;<br>kinds of highly publicized suicide stories,&nbsp;the number of people who die in commercial-<br>airline crashes increases by&nbsp;1,000 percent! Even more alarming: The increase is not&nbsp;<br>limited to airplane deaths. The number of&nbsp;automobile fatalities shoots up as well&nbsp;<br>(Phillips, 1980). What could possibly be responsible?&nbsp;<br>
One explanation suggests itself immediately:&nbsp;The same&nbsp;social conditions that cause&nbsp;<br>some people to commit suicide cause others&nbsp;to&nbsp;die accidentally. For instance, certain&nbsp;<br>individuals, the suicide-prone, may react to&nbsp;stressful societal events (economic&nbsp;<br>downturns, rising crime rates, international tensions) by ending it all. Others will react&nbsp;<br>differently to these same&nbsp;events; they might become angry, impatient, nervous, or&nbsp;<br>distracted. To the degree that such people operate&nbsp;or maintain&nbsp;the cars&nbsp;and&nbsp;planes&nbsp;of&nbsp;our&nbsp;<br>society, the vehicles will be less safe, and consequently, we will see a sharp increase&nbsp;in&nbsp;<br>the number of automobile and air fatalities.&nbsp;<br>
According to this &quot;social conditions&quot; interpretation, then, some&nbsp;of the same&nbsp;societal&nbsp;<br>factors that cause intentional deaths also cause&nbsp;accidental ones, and&nbsp;that is why we find&nbsp;<br>so strong a connection between suicide stories and fatal crashes. Another fascinating&nbsp;<br>statistic indicates that&nbsp;this is not the correct explanation: Fatal crashes increase&nbsp;<br>dramatically only in those regions where the suicide has been highly publicized. Other&nbsp;<br>places, existing under similar social conditions, whose newspapers have&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>publicized&nbsp;<br>the story, have shown no comparable jump in&nbsp;such fatalities.&nbsp;Furthermore, within&nbsp;those&nbsp;<br>areas where newspaper space has been allotted, the wider the&nbsp;publicity given the&nbsp;<br>suicide, the greater has been the rise in subsequent crashes. Thus, it is not some&nbsp;set of&nbsp;<br>common societal events&nbsp;that stimulates suicides on the one hand and fatal accidents on&nbsp;<br>the other. Instead, it is the&nbsp;publicized suicide story itself&nbsp;that produces the car and plane&nbsp;<br>wrecks.&nbsp;<br>
To explain&nbsp;the strong&nbsp;association&nbsp;between&nbsp;suicide-story publicity and subsequent&nbsp;<br>crashes, a &quot;bereavement&quot; account has been&nbsp;suggested. Because, it has been argued,&nbsp;<br>front-page suicides often involve well-known&nbsp;and respected public figures, perhaps their&nbsp;<br>highly publicized deaths throw&nbsp;many people into states of&nbsp;shocked sadness. Stunned and&nbsp;<br>preoccupied, these individuals become&nbsp;careless around cars and planes. The&nbsp;<br>consequence is the sharp increase in deadly&nbsp;accidents involving such vehicles that we&nbsp;<br>see after front-page suicide&nbsp;stories. Although the bereavement theory can account for&nbsp;<br>the connection between the degree of publicity given a story and subsequent crash&nbsp;<br>fatalities—the more people who learn of&nbsp;the suicide,&nbsp;the larger will be the number of&nbsp;<br>bereaved&nbsp;and careless individuals—it&nbsp;<i>cannot&nbsp;</i>explain another startling fact: Newspaper&nbsp;<br>stories reporting suicide victims who died alone produce an&nbsp;increase in the frequency of&nbsp;<br>single-fatality wrecks only, whereas stories&nbsp;reporting&nbsp;suicide-plus-murder incidents&nbsp;<br>produce an increase in multiple-fatality&nbsp;wrecks&nbsp;only. Simple bereavement could not&nbsp;<br>cause such a pattern.&nbsp;<br>

<i>Social Proof&nbsp;</i>123&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The influence of suicide stories on car and plane crashes, then, is fantastically specific.&nbsp;<br>Stories of pure&nbsp;suicides, in&nbsp;which only&nbsp;one&nbsp;person dies, generate&nbsp;wrecks in&nbsp;which only&nbsp;<br>one person dies; stories&nbsp;of suicide-murder&nbsp;combination, in&nbsp;which there are multiple&nbsp;<br>deaths, generate wrecks in which there are&nbsp;multiple deaths. If neither social conditions&quot;&nbsp;<br>nor &quot;bereavement&quot; can make sense of this bewildering array of tacts, what can? There is&nbsp;<br>a sociologist at the University of California in San Diego who thinks he has found the&nbsp;<br>answer. His&nbsp;name&nbsp;is David Phillips, and he points a&nbsp;convincing finger at something&nbsp;<br>called the &quot;Werther effect.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
The story of the Werther effect is both chilling and intriguing. More&nbsp;than two centuries&nbsp;<br>ago, the great man of German literature, Johann von Goethe, published a&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=133></a><b>124&nbsp;</b><i>Chapter 4</i>&nbsp;<br>
novel entitled&nbsp;<i>Die Leiden desjungen Werthers (The Sorrows of Young Wertherj.&nbsp;</i>The&nbsp;<br>book, in which the hero, named Werther, commits suicide, had a remarkable impact.&nbsp;<br>Not only did it provide Goethe with immediate fame, but it also sparked a wave of&nbsp;<br>emulative suicides across&nbsp;Europe. So powerful was this effect that authorities in several&nbsp;<br>countries banned the novel.&nbsp;<br>
Phillips's own work has traced&nbsp;the Werther effect to modern times (Phillips,&nbsp;1974).&nbsp;His&nbsp;<br>research has demonstrated that, immediately following a front-page suicide story, the&nbsp;<br>suicide rate increases dramatically in those geographical areas where the story has been&nbsp;<br>highly publicized. It is Phillips's argument&nbsp;that certain troubled people who read of&nbsp;<br>another's self-inflicted death kill themselves&nbsp;in imitation. In a morbid&nbsp;illustration of the&nbsp;<br>principle of social proof, these people decide how they should act on&nbsp;the basis of&nbsp;how&nbsp;<br>some&nbsp;other troubled person has acted.&nbsp;<br>
Phillips derived his evidence for the modern-day Werther effect from&nbsp;examining the&nbsp;<br>suicide statistics in the United States between 1947 and 1968. He found that, within two&nbsp;<br>months after every front-page&nbsp;suicide story, an&nbsp;average of&nbsp;58 more people than usual&nbsp;<br>killed themselves. In a sense, each suicide story killed 58 people who otherwise would&nbsp;<br>have gone on&nbsp;living.&nbsp;Phillips&nbsp;also&nbsp;found that this&nbsp;tendency for suicides to&nbsp;beget suicides&nbsp;<br>occurred principally in those parts of the&nbsp;country where the first suicide was highly&nbsp;<br>publicized. He observed that the wider the publicity given the first&nbsp;suicide, the greater&nbsp;<br>the number of later suicides (see Figure 4.1).&nbsp;<br>
If the facts surrounding the Werther effect&nbsp;seem&nbsp;to you suspiciously like those&nbsp;<br>surrounding the influence of suicide stories on air and traffic&nbsp;fatalities, the similarities&nbsp;<br>have not been lost on Phillips, either. In fact,&nbsp;he contends that all the excess&nbsp;deaths&nbsp;<br>following a front-page suicide incident can be&nbsp;explained as the same thing: copycat&nbsp;<br>suicides. Upon learning of another's suicide, an uncomfortably large number of people&nbsp;<br>decide that suicide is an appropriate action for themselves as well. Some of&nbsp;these&nbsp;<br>individuals then proceed to commit the&nbsp;act in a straightforward, no-bones-about-it&nbsp;<br>fashion, causing the suicide rate to jump.&nbsp;<br>
Others, however, are less direct. For any of&nbsp;several reasons—to protect their reputations,&nbsp;<br>to spare their families the shame and hurt,&nbsp;to allow their&nbsp;dependents&nbsp;to collect on&nbsp;<br>insurance policies—they do not want to appear&nbsp;to have killed themselves. They would&nbsp;<br>rather seem&nbsp;to have died accidentally. So, purposively but furtively,&nbsp;they cause the&nbsp;<br>wreck of a car or a plane they are operating&nbsp;or are simply riding in. This can be&nbsp;<br>accomplished in a variety of all-too-familiar-sounding ways. A commercial airline pilot&nbsp;<br>can dip the nose of the aircraft at a crucial&nbsp;point of takeoff or can&nbsp;inexplicably land on&nbsp;<br>an already&nbsp;occupied&nbsp;runway against the instructions from&nbsp;the control tower; the driver&nbsp;<br>of a car can suddenly swerve&nbsp;into a tree or into oncoming traffic; a passenger in an&nbsp;<br>automobile or corporate&nbsp;jet can incapacitate&nbsp;the operator, causing the deadly crash;&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>pilot of a private plane can, despite all radio&nbsp;warnings, plow into another aircraft. Thus,&nbsp;<br>the alarming climb in crash fatalities that&nbsp;we&nbsp;find following front-page suicides is,&nbsp;<br>according to&nbsp;Phillips, most likely due to the Werther effect secretly applied. I consider&nbsp;<br>this insight brilliant. First, it explains all of&nbsp;the data beautifully. If&nbsp;these wrecks really&nbsp;<br>are hidden instances of imitative suicide, it makes sense that we&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=134></a><i>Social Proof&nbsp;</i><b>125</b>&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
should see an increase in the wrecks after suicide stories appear. It makes sense that the&nbsp;<br>greatest rise in wrecks should occur after the suicide stories that have been most widely&nbsp;<br>publicized and have, consequently, reached the most people. It&nbsp;also&nbsp;makes sense that the&nbsp;<br>number of crashes should jump appreciably&nbsp;only in those geographical areas where the&nbsp;<br>suicide stories were publicized. It&nbsp;even makes sense that single-&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=135></a><IMG src="pdf-135_1.jpg"><br>
<hr>
<a name=136></a>126&nbsp;<i>Chapter 4</i>&nbsp;<br>
victim&nbsp;suicides should&nbsp;lead only to single-victim&nbsp;crashes,&nbsp;whereas multiple-victim&nbsp;<br>suicide incidents should lead only to multiple-victim&nbsp;crashes. Imitation is the key.&nbsp;<br>
In addition, there is a second valuable feature of Phillips's insight. Not only does it&nbsp;<br>allow us to explain the existing facts, it also allows us to predict new facts that&nbsp;had&nbsp;<br>never been uncovered before. For example,&nbsp;if the abnormally frequent crashes following&nbsp;<br>publicized suicides are genuinely the result&nbsp;of&nbsp;imitative rather than accidental&nbsp;actions,&nbsp;<br>they should&nbsp;be more deadly as a result. That is, people trying to kill themselves will&nbsp;<br>likely arrange (with a foot on the accelerator&nbsp;instead of the brake,&nbsp;with the nose of the&nbsp;<br>plane down instead of up) for&nbsp;the impact to&nbsp;be as lethal as&nbsp;possible. The consequence&nbsp;<br>should be quick and sure death. When Phillips examined the records to check on this&nbsp;<br>prediction, he found that&nbsp;the average number of people killed in a fatal crash of a&nbsp;<br>commercial airliner&nbsp;is&nbsp;more than three times&nbsp;greater if the crash happened one week&nbsp;<br>after a front-page suicide story than if&nbsp;it happened one week before. A similar&nbsp;<br>phenomenon can be found in traffic statistics, where there is evidence for the deadly&nbsp;<br>efficiency of post-suicide-story auto crashes. Victims of fatal car wrecks that follow&nbsp;<br>front-page suicide stories die four times&nbsp;more quickly than normal (Phillips, 1980).&nbsp;<br>
Still another fascinating prediction flows from&nbsp;Phillips's idea. If&nbsp;the increase in wrecks&nbsp;<br>following suicide stories truly represents a set of&nbsp;copycat deaths, then&nbsp;the imitators&nbsp;<br>should be most likely to copy the suicides of people who are similar to them. The&nbsp;<br>principle of&nbsp;social proof states that we use information about the way others have&nbsp;<br>behaved to help us determine proper conduct for ourselves. As the dropped-wallet&nbsp;<br>experiment showed, we are most influenced in&nbsp;this fashion by&nbsp;the&nbsp;actions of people who&nbsp;<br>are like us.&nbsp;<br>
Therefore, Phillips reasoned, if the principle of social proof is behind the phenomenon,&nbsp;<br>there should be some&nbsp;clear similarity between the victim&nbsp;of&nbsp;the highly publicized&nbsp;<br>suicide and those who cause subsequent wrecks.&nbsp;Realizing that the clearest test&nbsp;of&nbsp;this&nbsp;<br>possibility would come&nbsp;from&nbsp;the records of&nbsp;automobile crashes involving a single car&nbsp;<br>and a lone driver,&nbsp;Phillips compared the age of&nbsp;the suicide-story victim&nbsp;with the ages of&nbsp;<br>the lone drivers killed in single-car crashes immediately after the story appeared&nbsp;in&nbsp;<br>print. Once again the predictions were strikingly&nbsp;accurate: When the newspaper detailed&nbsp;<br>the suicide of a young person, it was young drivers who then piled their cars into trees,&nbsp;<br>poles, and embankments with fatal results; but when the news story&nbsp;concerned&nbsp;an older&nbsp;<br>person's suicide, older drivers died in such&nbsp;crashes (Phillips, 1980). This last statistic is&nbsp;<br>the clincher for me. I am left wholly convinced and, simultaneously, wholly amazed by&nbsp;<br>it. Evidently, the principle of social proof&nbsp;is so wide-ranging and powerful that its&nbsp;<br>domain extends to the fundamental decision&nbsp;for life or death. Phillips's findings&nbsp;<br>illustrate a distressing tendency for suicide&nbsp;publicity to motivate certain people who are&nbsp;<br>similar to the victim&nbsp;to kill themselves—because&nbsp;they now find the idea of suicide more&nbsp;<br>legitimate. Truly frightening are the data&nbsp;indicating that many innocent people die in the&nbsp;<br>bargain (see Figure 4.2).&nbsp;<br>
As if the frightening features&nbsp;of Phillips's suicide data weren't enough, his additional&nbsp;<br>research (Phillips, 1983) brings more&nbsp;cause for alarm:&nbsp;Homicides in this&nbsp;<br>

country have a simulated, copycat character&nbsp;after highly publicized&nbsp;acts of violence.&nbsp;<br>Heavyweight championship prize fights that&nbsp;receive coverage on network evening news&nbsp;<br>appear to produce measurable increases in&nbsp;the United&nbsp;States homicide rate.&nbsp;This&nbsp;<br>analysis of heavyweight championship fights (between 1973 and 1978) is perhaps most&nbsp;<br>compelling in its demonstration of&nbsp;the remarkably specific nature of&nbsp;the imitative&nbsp;<br>aggression that is generated. When such&nbsp;a match was lost by a black fighter, the&nbsp;<br>homicide rate during the following 10 days&nbsp;rose significantly for young black male&nbsp;<br>victims but not young white males. On the other hand, when a white fighter lost a&nbsp;<br>match, it was young white men, but not young black men, who were killed more&nbsp;<br>frequently in the next 10 days. When these results are combined with the parallel&nbsp;<br>findings in Phillips's suicide data, it is clear&nbsp;that widely publicized aggression has&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>nasty tendency to spread to similar victims,&nbsp;no matter whether the aggression is inflicted&nbsp;<br>on the self or on another.&nbsp;<br>
Perhaps nowhere are we&nbsp;brought into more dramatic contact with the unsettling side of&nbsp;<br>the principle of social proof than in the realm&nbsp;of copycat crime. Back in the 1970s, our&nbsp;<br>attention was brought to the phenomenon in&nbsp;the form&nbsp;of airplane hijackings, which&nbsp;<br>seemed to spread like airborne viruses.&nbsp;In the 1980s, our focus shifted to product&nbsp;<br>tamperings, such as the famous cases of&nbsp;Tylenol capsules injected with cyanide and&nbsp;<br>Gerber baby&nbsp;food products laced with glass.&nbsp;According to FBI forensic experts, each&nbsp;<br>nationally publicized incident of&nbsp;this sort&nbsp;spawned an average of 30 more incidents&nbsp;<br>(Toufexis, 1993). More recently, we've been jolted by the specter of contagious mass&nbsp;<br>murders, occurring first in workplace settings and then, incredibly, in the schools of our&nbsp;<br>nation. For instance, immediately following the bloody rampage by two Littleton,&nbsp;<br>Colorado, high-school students on April 20, 1999, police responded to scores of similar&nbsp;<br>threats, plots, and attempts by troubled&nbsp;students. Two of those attempts proved&nbsp;<br>&quot;successful&quot;: A 14-year-old in Taber, Alberta, and a 15-year-old&nbsp;in Conyers, Georgia,&nbsp;<br>killed or wounded a total of eight classmates&nbsp;within 10 days of the Littleton massacre.&nbsp;<br>
Events of this magnitude demand analysis&nbsp;and explanation. Some&nbsp;common thread needs&nbsp;<br>to be identified to&nbsp;make sense of it all.&nbsp;In the case of the workplace murders, observers&nbsp;<br>noticed how&nbsp;often the killing fields were&nbsp;the backrooms of U.S. post offices. So, the&nbsp;<br>finger of blame&nbsp;was pointed at the &quot;intolerable&nbsp;strains&quot; of the U.S. postal environment.&nbsp;<br>As for the school-based slaughter, commentators remarked on an odd commonality: All&nbsp;<br>the affected&nbsp;schools&nbsp;were located in rural&nbsp;or&nbsp;suburban communities rather than&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<br>ever-simmering cauldrons of inner-city neighborhoods. So, the media instructed us as to&nbsp;<br>the &quot;intolerable strains&quot; of growing up in&nbsp;small town or suburban America. By these&nbsp;<br>accounts, the stressors of U.S. post office environments and of small town American&nbsp;<br>life created&nbsp;the explosive reactions of&nbsp;those who worked and lived there. The&nbsp;<br>explanation is straightforward: Similar&nbsp;social conditions beget similar responses.&nbsp;<br>
But you and I have been down the &quot;similar social conditions&quot; road before in trying to&nbsp;<br>understand anomalous patterns of fatalities.&nbsp;Recall how Phillips (1979) considered the&nbsp;<br>possibility that a set of common social conditions in a particular en-&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
vironment might explain a rash of suicides there?&nbsp;It&nbsp;wasn't&nbsp;a satisfactory explanation for&nbsp;<br>the suicides; and I don't&nbsp;think it is a satisfactory account for the murder sprees, either.&nbsp;<br>Let's see if&nbsp;we can locate a better&nbsp;alternative&nbsp;by first trying to regain contact with&nbsp;<br>reality: The &quot;intolerable strains&quot; of working at the post office or of living in&nbsp;<br>rural/suburban America!?&nbsp;Come&nbsp;on. Compared&nbsp;to working in the coal mines or&nbsp;<br>compared to living on the gang-ruled, mean&nbsp;streets of inner cities?&nbsp;Come&nbsp;on. Certainly&nbsp;<br>the&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=140></a>130&nbsp;<i>Chapter 4</i>&nbsp;<br>
environments where the mass slaying occurred&nbsp;have their tensions. But they appear no&nbsp;<br>more severe (and often appear&nbsp;less severe) than many other environments where such&nbsp;<br>incidents have not taken&nbsp;place. No, the similar social conditions theory doesn't&nbsp;<br>
offer a plausible account.&nbsp;<br>
Then what does?&nbsp;I'd nod right at the principle of social proof, which asserts that people,&nbsp;<br>especially when they are unsure of themselves, follow the lead of similar others. Who is&nbsp;<br>more similar to a disgruntled postal&nbsp;employee than another disgruntled postal&nbsp;<br>employee?&nbsp;And who is more similar to troubled small town American teenagers than&nbsp;<br>other troubled small town American teenagers?&nbsp;It is a regrettable&nbsp;constant of modern&nbsp;<br>life that many people live their lives in psychological pain. How they deal with the pain&nbsp;<br>depends on numerous factors, one of&nbsp;which is a recognition of how others&nbsp;<i>just like them&nbsp;<br></i>have chosen to deal with it.&nbsp;As we saw in Phillips's&nbsp;data, a highly publicized suicide&nbsp;<br>prompts copycat suicides&nbsp;from&nbsp;similar others—from&nbsp;<i>copies&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>of the cat. I believe the&nbsp;<br>same can be said for a&nbsp;highly publicized multiple murder.&nbsp;As is the&nbsp;case for suicide&nbsp;<br>stories, media officials need to think deeply about how and how prominently to present&nbsp;<br>reports of killing sprees. Such reports&nbsp;are not only riveting, sensational, and&nbsp;<br>newsworthy, they are malignant.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Monkey Island</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Work like Phillips's helps us appreciate the awesome influence of the behavior of&nbsp;<br>similar others. Once the&nbsp;enormity of&nbsp;that&nbsp;force is recognized, it becomes possible to&nbsp;<br>understand perhaps the&nbsp;most&nbsp;spectacular act of compliance of our time—the mass&nbsp;<br>suicide at Jonestown, Guyana. Certain crucial features of the event deserve&nbsp;<br>
review.&nbsp;<br>
The People's Temple was a cultlike organization that was based in&nbsp;San Francisco&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br>drew its recruits from&nbsp;the&nbsp;poor of that city.&nbsp;In 1977, the Reverend Jim&nbsp;Jones—who was&nbsp;<br>the group's undisputed political, social, and&nbsp;spiritual leader— moved the bulk of the&nbsp;<br>membership with him to a jungle settlement&nbsp;in Guyana, South America. There, the&nbsp;<br>People's Temple existed in relative obscurity until November 18, 1978, when&nbsp;<br>Congressmen Leo R. Ryan of California (who had gone to Guyana to investigate the&nbsp;<br>cult), three members of Ryan's fact-finding&nbsp;party, and a cult defector were murdered&nbsp;as&nbsp;<br>they tried to leave Jonestown by plane. Convinced that he would be arrested and&nbsp;<br>implicated in the killings&nbsp;and that the demise of the People's Temple would result,&nbsp;Jones&nbsp;<br>sought to control the end of the Temple&nbsp;in his own way. He gathered the entire&nbsp;<br>community around him&nbsp;and issued a call for each&nbsp;person's death to be done in a unified&nbsp;<br>act of self-destruction.&nbsp;<br>
The first response was that of a young woman who calmly approached the now famous&nbsp;<br>vat of strawberry-flavored poison, administered one dose to her baby, one to herself,&nbsp;<br>and then sat down in a&nbsp;field, where she and&nbsp;her child died in convulsions within four&nbsp;<br>minutes. Others followed steadily in turn.&nbsp;Although a handful of Jones-towners escaped&nbsp;<br>and a few others are reported to have resisted, the survivors claim&nbsp;that the&nbsp;great majority&nbsp;<br>of the 910 people who died did so&nbsp;in&nbsp;an orderly, willful fashion.&nbsp;<br>

<a name=141></a><i>Social Proof&nbsp;</i>131&nbsp;<br>
News of the&nbsp;event shocked us. The broadcast media and the papers provided a barrage&nbsp;<br>of reports, updates, and analyses. For days, our conversations&nbsp;were full of the topic,&nbsp;<br>&quot;How many have they found dead now?&quot;&nbsp;&quot;A&nbsp;guy who escaped said they were drinking&nbsp;<br>the poison like they were hypnotized or something.&quot; &quot;What were they doing down in&nbsp;<br>South America, anyway?&quot; &quot;It's so&nbsp;hard to believe. What caused it?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Yes, &quot;What&nbsp;caused it?&quot;—the critical question.&nbsp;How are we to account for this&nbsp;most&nbsp;<br>astounding of compliant acts?&nbsp;Various explanations have&nbsp;been offered. Some&nbsp;have&nbsp;<br>focused on the charisma&nbsp;of Jim&nbsp;Jones, a man&nbsp;whose style allowed him&nbsp;to be loved like a&nbsp;<br>savior, trusted like a father, and treated like an emperor. Other explanations have&nbsp;<br>pointed to the kind of people who were attracted to the People's Temple. They were&nbsp;<br>mostly poor and uneducated individuals who were willing to give up their freedoms of&nbsp;<br>thought and action for the safety of a place where all decisions would be made for them.&nbsp;<br>Still other explanations have emphasized the quasi-religious nature of&nbsp;the People's&nbsp;<br>Temple, in which unquestioned faith in the cult's leader was assigned highest priority.&nbsp;<br>
No doubt each of these features of Jonestown has merit in explaining what happened&nbsp;<br>there, but I do not find them&nbsp;sufficient. After all, the world abounds with cults populated&nbsp;<br>by dependent people who are led by a charismatic figure. What's more, there has never&nbsp;<br>been a shortage of this combination of circumstances in the past. Yet virtually nowhere&nbsp;<br>do we find evidence of&nbsp;an event even approximating the Jonestown incident among&nbsp;<br>such groups. There must be something else that was critical.&nbsp;<br>
One especially revealing question gives us&nbsp;a clue: &quot;If&nbsp;the community had remained in&nbsp;<br>San Francisco, would Reverend Jones's suicide command have been obeyed?&quot; A highly&nbsp;<br>speculative&nbsp;question&nbsp;to&nbsp;be sure,&nbsp;but the&nbsp;expert&nbsp;most familiar with the People's Temple&nbsp;<br>had no doubt about the answer. Dr. Louis Job/on&nbsp;West, then chairman of psychiatry and&nbsp;<br>biobehavioral sciences at UCLA and director of its neuro-psychiatric unit, was an&nbsp;<br>authority on cults who had observed the People's Temple for eight years prior&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<br>Jonestown deaths. When interviewed in the&nbsp;immediate aftermath, he made what strikes&nbsp;<br>me&nbsp;as an inordinately instructive statement: &quot;This wouldn't&nbsp;have happened in California.&nbsp;<br>But they lived in total alienation from the rest of the world in a jungle situation in a&nbsp;<br>hostile country.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Although lost in the welter of commentary&nbsp;following the tragedy, West's observation,&nbsp;<br>together with what we know about the principle of social proof, seems to me quite&nbsp;<br>important to a satisfactory understanding of&nbsp;the compliant suicides. To my mind, the&nbsp;<br>single act in the history of the People's Temple that most contributed to the members'&nbsp;<br>mindless compliance that day&nbsp;occurred a year&nbsp;earlier&nbsp;with the relocation of&nbsp;the Temple&nbsp;<br>to a jungled&nbsp;country of unfamiliar customs and&nbsp;people. If we are to&nbsp;believe the stories&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>Jim&nbsp;Jones's malevolent genius, he realized&nbsp;fully the massive psychological impact such&nbsp;<br>a move would have on his followers.&nbsp;All at&nbsp;once,&nbsp;they found themselves in a place they&nbsp;<br>knew nothing about. South America, and the rain forests of Guyana, especially, were&nbsp;<br>unlike anything they had experienced in San Francisco. The environment—both&nbsp;<br>physical and social—into which they were&nbsp;dropped must&nbsp;have seemed dreadfully&nbsp;<br>uncertain.&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
Ah, uncertainty—the right-hand man of the principle of social proof. We&nbsp;have already&nbsp;<br>seen that when people are uncertain, they look&nbsp;to the actions of&nbsp;others to guide their&nbsp;<br>own actions. In the alien, Guyanese environment, then, Temple members were very&nbsp;<br>ready to follow the lead of others. As we have also seen, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;others&nbsp;of a&nbsp;special&nbsp;kind&nbsp;<br>whose behavior will be most&nbsp;unquestioningly followed: similar others. Therein lies the&nbsp;<br>awful beauty of Reverend Jones's relocation strategy. In a country&nbsp;like Guyana, there&nbsp;<br>were no similar others for a Jonestown resident but the people of Jonestown itself.&nbsp;<br>
What was right for a member of the community was determined to a disproportionate&nbsp;<br>degree by what other community members—influenced heavily by Jones— did and&nbsp;<br>believed. When viewed in this light,&nbsp;the terrible&nbsp;orderliness, the lack of panic, the sense&nbsp;<br>of calm with which these people moved to the vat of poison and to their deaths seems&nbsp;<br>more comprehensible. They hadn't been hypnotized by Jones; they had been&nbsp;<br>convinced—partly by him&nbsp;but, more importantly, by the principle of social proof—that&nbsp;<br>suicide was the correct conduct. The uncertainty they surely felt upon&nbsp;<br>

first hearing the death command must have caused them&nbsp;to look around them&nbsp;for a&nbsp;<br>definition of&nbsp;the appropriate response.&nbsp;<br>
It is worth particular note that&nbsp;they found two impressive pieces of social&nbsp;evidence, each&nbsp;<br>pointing in the same&nbsp;direction. The first was the initial set of their compatriots, who&nbsp;<br>quickly and willingly took the poison drafts. There will always be a few such fanatically&nbsp;<br>obedient individuals in any strong leader-dominated group. Whether, in this instance,&nbsp;<br>they had been specially instructed beforehand to serve as examples or whether they&nbsp;<br>were just naturally the most compliant with Jones's wishes is difficult to know. No&nbsp;<br>matter; the psychological effect of&nbsp;the actions of those individuals must have been&nbsp;<br>potent. If&nbsp;the suicides&nbsp;of&nbsp;similar others in&nbsp;news stories can influence total strangers to&nbsp;<br>kill themselves, imagine how enormously more compelling such an act would be when&nbsp;<br>performed without hesitation by one's&nbsp;neighbors in a place like Jonestown. The second&nbsp;<br>source of social evidence came from&nbsp;the reactions of the crowd itself. Given the&nbsp;<br>conditions, I suspect that what&nbsp;occurred was a large-scale&nbsp;instance of&nbsp;the pluralistic&nbsp;<br>ignorance phenomenon. Each Jonestowner looked to the actions of surrounding&nbsp;<br>individuals to assess the situation&nbsp;and—finding calmness because everyone else, too,&nbsp;<br>was surreptitiously&nbsp;assessing rather&nbsp;than reacting—&quot;learned&quot; that&nbsp;patient turntaking was&nbsp;<br>the correct behavior. Such misinterpreted,&nbsp;but nonetheless convincing, social evidence,&nbsp;<br>would be expected to&nbsp;result precisely in the&nbsp;ghastly&nbsp;composure of the assemblage that&nbsp;<br>waited in the tropics of&nbsp;Guyana for businesslike death.&nbsp;<br>
From my&nbsp;own perspective, most attempts&nbsp;to analyze the Jonestown incident have&nbsp;<br>focused too much on the personal qualities&nbsp;of Jim Jones. Although he was without&nbsp;<br>question a man of rare dynamism, the power he&nbsp;wielded strikes me&nbsp;as coming less from&nbsp;<br>his remarkable personal style than from&nbsp;his understanding of fundamental psychological&nbsp;<br>principles. His real genius as a leader was his realization of&nbsp;the limitations of&nbsp;individual&nbsp;<br>leadership. No leader can&nbsp;hope to persuade, regularly&nbsp;and single-handedly, all the&nbsp;<br>members of the group. A forceful leader can reasonably expect, however, to persuade&nbsp;<br>some&nbsp;sizable proportion of group members. Then&nbsp;the raw information&nbsp;that a substantial&nbsp;<br>number of group members has been convinced&nbsp;can, by itself, convince the rest. Thus,&nbsp;<br>the most influential leaders are those who know how to arrange group conditions&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>allow the principle of social proof to work in&nbsp;their favor. It is in this that Jones appears&nbsp;<br>to have been inspired. His masterstroke was the decision to move the People's Temple&nbsp;<br>community from&nbsp;urban San Francisco to the&nbsp;remoteness of equatorial South America,&nbsp;<br>where the conditions&nbsp;of uncertainty&nbsp;and ex-lusive&nbsp;similarity&nbsp;would make the principle of&nbsp;<br>social proof operate for him&nbsp;as perhaps nowhere else. There a settlement of a thousand&nbsp;<br>people, much too large to be held&nbsp;<br>
ersistent sway by the force of one man's personality, could be changed from&nbsp;a following&nbsp;<br>into a&nbsp;<i>herd.&nbsp;</i>As slaughterhouse operators have long known, the mentality of a&nbsp;<br>
1 makes it easy to manage. Simply get some&nbsp;members moving in&nbsp;the&nbsp;desired&nbsp;direction&nbsp;<br>and the others—responding not so much to the lead animal as to those immediately&nbsp;<br>surrounding&nbsp;them—will peacefully&nbsp;and mechanically go&nbsp;along. The powers the amazing&nbsp;<br>Reverend Jones, then, are probably best understood not in terms of his dramatic&nbsp;<br>personal style but in his profound knowledge of the art of social jujitsu.&nbsp;<br>

<b>DEFENSE</b>&nbsp;<br>
I began this chapter with an&nbsp;account of the relatively harmless practice of laugh tracking&nbsp;<br>and moved on to stories of murder and suicide—all explained by the principle of social&nbsp;<br>proof. How can we expect to defend ourselves against a weapon of influence that&nbsp;<br>pervades such a vast range of behavior?&nbsp;The difficulty is compounded by the realization&nbsp;<br>that, most of the time, we don't&nbsp;want to guard against the information that social proof&nbsp;<br>provides. The evidence it offers about the way we should act is usually valid and&nbsp;<br>valuable (Hill, 1982; Laughlin, 1980; Warnik&nbsp;&amp; Sanders, 1980). With it we can cruise&nbsp;<br>confidently through countless decisions without having to investigate the detailed pros&nbsp;<br>and cons of each. In this sense, the principle of social proof equips us with a wonderful&nbsp;<br>kind of automatic pilot device not unlike that aboard most aircraft.&nbsp;<br>
Yet there are occasional, but real,&nbsp;problems with automatic pilots. Those problems&nbsp;<br>appear whenever the flight information locked into the control mechanism&nbsp;is wrong. In&nbsp;<br>these instances, we will be&nbsp;taken off course. Depending on&nbsp;the size of the error, the&nbsp;<br>consequences can be severe; but, because the&nbsp;automatic pilot afforded by the principle&nbsp;<br>of social proof is more often an ally than an&nbsp;enemy, we can't&nbsp;be expected to want simply&nbsp;<br>to disconnect it. Thus,&nbsp;we are faced&nbsp;with a&nbsp;classic problem:&nbsp;how to make use of a piece&nbsp;<br>of equipment that simultaneously benefits and imperils our welfare.&nbsp;<br>
Fortunately,&nbsp;there is a way out of the dilemma. Because the disadvantages of automatic&nbsp;<br>pilots arise principally when incorrect data&nbsp;have been put into the control system, our&nbsp;<br>best defense against these disadvantages is to recognize when the data are in error. If we&nbsp;<br>can become&nbsp;sensitive to&nbsp;situations in which&nbsp;the social&nbsp;proof&nbsp;automatic pilot is working&nbsp;<br>with inaccurate information, we can disengage the mechanism and grasp the controls&nbsp;<br>when we need to.&nbsp;<br>
<b>Sabotage</b>&nbsp;<br>
There are two types of situations in which incorrect data cause the principle of social&nbsp;<br>proof to give us poor counsel. The first occurs when the social evidence has been&nbsp;<br>purposely&nbsp;falsified.&nbsp;Invariably these&nbsp;situations&nbsp;are manufactured by&nbsp;exploiters intent&nbsp;on&nbsp;<br>creating the&nbsp;<i>impression</i>—reality be damned—that a multitude is performing the way the&nbsp;<br>exploiters want us to perform. The canned&nbsp;laughter of TV comedy&nbsp;shows&nbsp;is one variety&nbsp;<br>of faked data of this sort, but there is a&nbsp;great deal more, and much of the fakery is&nbsp;<br>strikingly obvious.&nbsp;<br>
For instance, canned responses are not unique&nbsp;to the electronic media or even to the&nbsp;<br>electronic age. In fact, the heavy-handed exploitation of the principle of social proof can&nbsp;<br>be traced through the history of&nbsp;grand opera, one of our most&nbsp;venerable art forms. This&nbsp;<br>is the phenomenon called claquing, said to&nbsp;have begun in 1820 by a pair of Paris opera-<br>house habitues named Sauton and Porcher.&nbsp;The men were more than opera-goers,&nbsp;<br>though. They were businessmen whose product was applause.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<i>Social Proof&nbsp;</i>135&nbsp;<br>
Organizing under the title L'Assurance des Succes Dramatiques, they leased themselves&nbsp;<br>and their employees to singers and opera managers who wished to be assured of an&nbsp;<br>appreciative audience response. So effective were Sauton and Porcher in stimulating&nbsp;<br>genuine audience reaction with their rigged reactions that, before long, claques (usually&nbsp;<br>consisting of a leader—<i>chef de claque</i>—and several individual&nbsp;<i>claqueurs)&nbsp;</i>had become&nbsp;<br>an established and persistent tradition throughout the world of&nbsp;opera. As music historian&nbsp;<br>Robert Sabin (1964) notes, &quot;By 1830 the claque was a full-bloom&nbsp;institution, collecting&nbsp;<br>by day, applauding by night, all in the honest&nbsp;open.... But it is altogether probable that&nbsp;<br>neither Sauton, nor his ally Porcher, had a notion of the extent&nbsp;to which their scheme&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>paid applause would be adopted and applied wherever opera is sung.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
As claquing&nbsp;grew and&nbsp;developed,&nbsp;its practitioners offered an&nbsp;array of styles&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br>strengths. In the same&nbsp;way that laugh-track producers hire individuals who excel in&nbsp;<br>titters, chuckles, or belly laughs, the claques spawned their&nbsp;own specialists—the&nbsp;<br><i>pleureuse,&nbsp;</i>chosen for her ability&nbsp;to weep on cue; the&nbsp;<i>bisseur,&nbsp;</i>who called&nbsp;<i>&quot;bis&quot;&nbsp;</i>(repeat)&nbsp;<br>and &quot;encore&quot; in ecstatic tones;&nbsp;and, in direct kinship with&nbsp;today's laugh-track performer,&nbsp;<br>the&nbsp;<i>rieur,&nbsp;</i>selected for the infectious quality of his laugh.&nbsp;<br>
For our purposes, though, the most instructive parallel to modern forms of canned&nbsp;<br>response is the conspicuous character of the fakery. No special need was seen to&nbsp;<br>disguise or vary the claque, who often sat in the same&nbsp;seats, performance after&nbsp;<br>performance, year after year, led by a&nbsp;<i>chefde claque&nbsp;</i>two decades into his position. Even&nbsp;<br>the monetary transactions&nbsp;were not hidden from the public. Indeed, one hundred years&nbsp;<br>after the birth of claquing, a reader of the London&nbsp;<i>Musical Times&nbsp;</i>could scan the&nbsp;<br>advertised rates of the Italian&nbsp;<i>claqueurs&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>(see Figure 4.3). Whether in the world&nbsp;<br><i>ofRigoletto&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>or TV sit-coms, then, audiences have&nbsp;been successfully manipulated by&nbsp;<br>those who use social evidence, even when&nbsp;that evidence has been openly falsified.&nbsp;<br>

What Sauton and Porcher realized about the mechanical way that we abide by the&nbsp;<br>principle of social proof is understood as well by a variety of today's profiteers. They&nbsp;<br>see no need to hide the manufactured nature of&nbsp;the social evidence they provide—<br>witness the amateurish quality&nbsp;of the average TV&nbsp;laugh track. They seem&nbsp;almost smug&nbsp;<br>in the recognition of&nbsp;our&nbsp;predicament: Either we&nbsp;must allow them to fool us or we must&nbsp;<br>abandon the precious automatic pilots that make&nbsp;us so vulnerable to their tricks. In their&nbsp;<br>certainty that they have us trapped, however, such exploiters have made a crucial&nbsp;<br>mistake. The laxity with which they construct phony social evidence gives us a way to&nbsp;<br>fight back.&nbsp;<br>
Because automatic pilots can be engaged and disengaged at&nbsp;will, we can cruise along&nbsp;<br>trusting in the course steered by&nbsp;the principle of social proof&nbsp;<i>until&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>we recognize that&nbsp;<br>inaccurate data are being used. Then we can&nbsp;take the controls,&nbsp;make the necessary&nbsp;<br>correction for the misinformation, and reset the&nbsp;automatic pilot. The transparency of the&nbsp;<br>rigged social proof we get these days provides&nbsp;us with&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;the cue we need for&nbsp;<br>knowing when to perform this simple maneuver. With no more cost than a bit of&nbsp;<br>vigilance for plainly counterfeit social evidence, then, we can&nbsp;protect ourselves nicely.&nbsp;<br>
Let's take an example. A bit earlier, I noted&nbsp;the&nbsp;proliferation of&nbsp;average person-on-the-<br>street ads, in which a number of ordinary&nbsp;people speak glowingly of a product, often&nbsp;<br>without knowing that their words are being recorded. As would be expected according&nbsp;<br>to the principle of social proof, these testimonials from&nbsp;&quot;average people like you and&nbsp;<br>me&quot; make for quite effective advertising&nbsp;campaigns. They have always included a&nbsp;<br>relatively subtle kind of distortion: We hear only from&nbsp;those who like the product; as a&nbsp;<br>result, we get an understandably biased picture of the amount of social support for it.&nbsp;<br>More recently, though,&nbsp;a cruder and more unethical sort of falsification has been&nbsp;<br>introduced. Commercial producers often don't bother to get genuine testimonials. They&nbsp;<br>merely hire&nbsp;actors to play the roles of&nbsp;average people testifying in an unrehearsed&nbsp;<br>fashion to&nbsp;an interviewer. It is amazing how&nbsp;bald-faced these &quot;unrehearsed interview&quot;&nbsp;<br>commercials can be. The situations are obviously staged, the participants&nbsp;are clearly&nbsp;<br>actors, and the dialogue is&nbsp;unmistakably prewritten.&nbsp;<br>
I know that whenever I encounter an influence&nbsp;attempt of this sort, it sets off in me a&nbsp;<br>kind of alarm&nbsp;with&nbsp;a clear directive:&nbsp;<i>Attention! Attention! Bad social proof in this&nbsp;<br>situation. Temporarily disconnect automatic pilot.&nbsp;</i>It's so easy to do. We&nbsp;need only&nbsp;<br>make a conscious decision to be alert to counterfeit social evidence. We&nbsp;can relax until&nbsp;<br>the exploiters'&nbsp;evident fakery is spotted, at which time we can pounce.&nbsp;<br>
And we should pounce with a vengeance. I am&nbsp;speaking of more than simply ignoring&nbsp;<br>the misinformation, although this defensive tactic is certainly called for. I am&nbsp;speaking&nbsp;<br>of aggressive counterattack. Whenever possible we ought to sting those responsible for&nbsp;<br>the rigging of social evidence. We&nbsp;should purchase no products featured in phony&nbsp;<br>&quot;unrehearsed interview&quot; commercials. Moreover,&nbsp;each&nbsp;manufacturer of the items should&nbsp;<br>receive a letter explaining&nbsp;our response and recommending that they discontinue use of&nbsp;<br>the advertising agency that produced so&nbsp;deceptive a presentation of their product.&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
Of course, we don't always want to trust the actions of others to&nbsp;direct our conduct—<br>especially in a situation important enough to&nbsp;warrant our personal investigation of the&nbsp;<br>pros and cons, or one in which we are experts—but we do want to be able&nbsp;to count on&nbsp;<br>others'&nbsp;behavior as a source of valid information in a wide range of settings. If we find&nbsp;<br>in such&nbsp;settings that we cannot trust the information to&nbsp;be valid&nbsp;because someone has&nbsp;<br>tampered with the evidence, we ought to be ready to strike back. In&nbsp;such instances, I&nbsp;<br>personally feel driven by&nbsp;more than&nbsp;an aversion to being duped. I&nbsp;bristle at the thought&nbsp;<br>of being pushed into an unacceptable corner&nbsp;by those who would use one of my hedges&nbsp;<br>against the decisional overload of modern life against me. And I get a genuine sense of&nbsp;<br>righteousness by lashing out when they&nbsp;try. If you are like me, so should you.&nbsp;<br>

instance, an&nbsp;innocent,&nbsp;natural error will produce snowballing&nbsp;social proof that pushes&nbsp;us&nbsp;<br>to an incorrect decision. The&nbsp;pluralistic ignorance phenomenon, in which everyone at an&nbsp;<br>emergency sees no cause for alarm,&nbsp;is one example of&nbsp;this process. The best illustration&nbsp;<br>I know, however, comes from&nbsp;Singapore, where a few years ago, for no good reason,&nbsp;<br>customers of a local bank began drawing out&nbsp;their money in a frenzy. The run on this&nbsp;<br>respected bank remained a mystery&nbsp;until much later,&nbsp;when researchers&nbsp;interviewing&nbsp;<br>participants&nbsp;discovered&nbsp;its peculiar&nbsp;cause:&nbsp;An unexpected bus strike had created an&nbsp;<br>abnormally large crowd waiting at the bus stop&nbsp;in front of the bank that day. Mistaking&nbsp;<br>the gathering for a crush of customers poised to withdraw their&nbsp;funds from&nbsp;a failing&nbsp;<br>bank, passersby panicked and got in line to withdraw their deposits, which led more&nbsp;<br>passersby to do the same. Soon after opening its&nbsp;doors, the bank was forced to close to&nbsp;<br>prevent a complete crash (&quot;News,&quot; 1988).&nbsp;<br>

<a name=149></a><i>Social Proof&nbsp;</i>139&nbsp;<br>
This account provides certain insights into the way we respond&nbsp;to social proof. First, we&nbsp;<br>seem&nbsp;to assume&nbsp;that if a lot of people&nbsp;are doing the same&nbsp;thing, they must know&nbsp;<br>something we don't. Especially when we are uncertain, we are willing to place an&nbsp;<br>enormous amount of trust in the collective knowledge of the crowd. Second, quite&nbsp;<br>frequently the crowd is&nbsp;mistaken because its&nbsp;members are not acting on the basis of any&nbsp;<br>superior information but are reacting, themselves, to the principle of social proof.&nbsp;<br>
There is a lesson here: An automatic pilot&nbsp;device, like social proof, should never be&nbsp;<br>trusted fully; even when&nbsp;no saboteur&nbsp;has slipped information into the mechanism,&nbsp;it can&nbsp;<br>sometimes go haywire&nbsp;by&nbsp;itself.&nbsp;We need to&nbsp;check the machine from&nbsp;time to time to be&nbsp;<br>sure that it hasn't&nbsp;worked itself out of sync with the other sources of evidence in the&nbsp;<br>situation—the objective facts, our prior experiences, our own judgments. Fortunately,&nbsp;<br>this precaution requires&nbsp;neither much effort nor much&nbsp;time. A quick glance around is all&nbsp;<br>that is needed. And this&nbsp;little precaution is&nbsp;well worth it. The consequences of single-<br>minded reliance on social evidence can be frightening.&nbsp;For instance, a serious&nbsp;<br>international incident developed in 1983 when&nbsp;a Korean Airlines jet strayed deep into&nbsp;<br>Soviet airspace and was&nbsp;shot down by Russian&nbsp;fighters. Subsequent analysis determined&nbsp;<br>that during the flight, the jetliner's crew&nbsp;had never checked their progress manually,&nbsp;<br>relying entirely on their autopilot, which had been fed the wrong magnetic heading at&nbsp;<br>the flight's&nbsp;outset (Staff, 1993).&nbsp;<br>
Certainly, a&nbsp;flier whose&nbsp;plane is locked into&nbsp;automatic pilot would be wise to glance&nbsp;<br>occasionally&nbsp;at the instrument panel and out&nbsp;the window. In&nbsp;the same&nbsp;way, we need&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>look up and around periodically whenever we are locked into the evidence of the crowd.&nbsp;<br>Without this simple safeguard against misguided social proof, our&nbsp;outcomes might well&nbsp;<br>run parallel to those of the Korean Airliner and the Singapore bank: crash.&nbsp;<br>
<b>READER'S&nbsp;REPORT 4.2</b>&nbsp;<br>
<b>From a Former Racetrack Employee</b>&nbsp;<br>
I became aware of one method of faking social evidence to one's advantage while&nbsp;<br>working at a racetrack. In order to lower&nbsp;the odds and make more money, some bettors&nbsp;<br>are able to sway the public to bet on bad horses.&nbsp;<br>
Odds at a racetrack are based on where the&nbsp;money is being&nbsp;bet. The more money on a&nbsp;<br>horse, the better the odds. Many people who play the horses have surprisingly little&nbsp;<br>knowledge of racing or betting strategy. Thus,&nbsp;especially when they don't know much&nbsp;<br>about the horses in a particular race, a lot of&nbsp;times they'll simply bet the favorite.&nbsp;<br>Because tote boards display up-to-the-minute odds, the public can always tell who the&nbsp;<br>current&nbsp;favorite is.&nbsp;The system&nbsp;that a high roller can use to&nbsp;alter the odds is actually&nbsp;<br>quite simple. The guy has in mind a horse he&nbsp;feels has a good chance of winning. Next&nbsp;<br>he chooses a horse that has long odds (say, 15&nbsp;to 1) and doesn't have a realistic chance&nbsp;<br>to win. The minute the mutual windows&nbsp;open, the guy puts down $100 on the inferior&nbsp;<br>horse, creating an instant favorite whose&nbsp;odds on the board drop to about 2 to 1.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=150></a>140&nbsp;<i>Chapter 4</i>&nbsp;<br>
Now the elements of social proof begin to&nbsp;work. People who are uncertain of how to bet&nbsp;<br>the race look&nbsp;to the&nbsp;tote&nbsp;board to see which horse the early&nbsp;bettors have decided is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>favorite, and they follow. A snowballing effect&nbsp;now occurs as other people continue to&nbsp;<br>bet the favorite. At this point, the high roller can go back to the window and bet heavily&nbsp;<br>on his true favorite, which will have better odds now because the &quot;new&nbsp;favorite&quot; has&nbsp;<br>been pushed down the board. If the guy wins, the initial $100 investment will have been&nbsp;<br>worth it many times over.&nbsp;<br>
I've seen this happen myself. I remember one time&nbsp;a person put down $100 on a pre-<br>race 10 to 1 shot, making it the early&nbsp;favorite.&nbsp;The rumors started circulating around the&nbsp;<br>track—the early bettors knew something.&nbsp;Next thing you know, everyone (myself&nbsp;<br>included) was betting on this horse. It ended up running last and had a bad leg. Many&nbsp;<br>people lost a lot of money. Somebody came&nbsp;out&nbsp;ahead, though. We'll never know who.&nbsp;<br>But he is the one with all the money. He&nbsp;understood the theory of social proof.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Author's note:&nbsp;</b>Once again we can see that social proof is most telling&nbsp;for those who&nbsp;<br>feel unfamiliar or unsure in a specific&nbsp;situation and who, consequently, must look&nbsp;<br>outside of themselves for evidence of how best to behave there.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<b>SUMMARY</b>&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;The principle of social proof states&nbsp;that one&nbsp;important means that people use to decide&nbsp;<br>what to believe or how to act&nbsp;in a situation is to look at&nbsp;what other people are believing&nbsp;<br>or doing there. Powerful imitative effects&nbsp;have been found among both children and&nbsp;<br>adults and in such diverse&nbsp;activities as purchase decisions, charity donations, and phobia&nbsp;<br>remission. The principle of social proof can&nbsp;be used to stimulate a person's compliance&nbsp;<br>with a request by informing the person that many other individuals (the more, the better)&nbsp;<br>are or have been complying with it.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;Social proof&nbsp;is most influential under two conditions.&nbsp;The first is uncertainty.&nbsp;When&nbsp;<br>people are unsure, when the situation&nbsp;is ambiguous, they are more likely to attend to the&nbsp;<br>actions of others and to&nbsp;accept those actions&nbsp;as correct. In ambiguous situations, for&nbsp;<br>instance, the decisions of bystanders&nbsp;to help&nbsp;are much more&nbsp;influenced by the actions of&nbsp;<br>other bystanders than when the situation is a clear-cut emergency. The second condition&nbsp;<br>under which social proof is most influential&nbsp;is similarity: People are more inclined to&nbsp;<br>follow the lead of similar others.&nbsp;Evidence&nbsp;for the powerful effect of&nbsp;the actions of&nbsp;<br>similar others on human behavior can be readily&nbsp;seen in the suicide statistics compiled&nbsp;<br>by sociologist David Phillips. Those statistics indicate that after highly publicized&nbsp;<br>suicide stories other troubled&nbsp;individuals, who are similar&nbsp;to the suicide-story victim,&nbsp;<br>decide&nbsp;to kill themselves. An analysis of&nbsp;the mass suicide incident at Jonestown,&nbsp;<br>Guyana, suggests that the group's leader,&nbsp;Reverend Jim&nbsp;Jones, used both of the&nbsp;<br>

factors of&nbsp;uncertainty&nbsp;and similarity to induce&nbsp;a herdlike suicide response from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>majority of the Jonestown population.&nbsp;<br>
Recommendations to reduce our susceptibility to faulty social&nbsp;proof&nbsp;include a sensitivity&nbsp;<br>to clearly counterfeit evidence of what similar others are doing and a recognition that&nbsp;<br>the actions of similar others should not form&nbsp;the sole basis for our decisions.&nbsp;<br>

<i>The main work of a trial attorney is to make a jury like his client.</i>&nbsp;<br>
—CLARENCE DARROW&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=154></a>Few of us would be surprised to&nbsp;learn that, as a rule, we most prefer to say&nbsp;yes to the&nbsp;<br>requests of people we know and like. What might be startling to note, however, is that&nbsp;<br>this simple rule is used in hundreds of ways&nbsp;by total strangers to get us to comply with&nbsp;<br><i>their&nbsp;</i>requests.&nbsp;<br>
The clearest illustration I know&nbsp;of the professional exploitation of the liking&nbsp;rule is the&nbsp;<br>Tupperware party,&nbsp;which&nbsp;I consider a classic compliance setting. Anybody familiar with&nbsp;<br>the workings of a Tupperware party will recognize the use of the various weapons of&nbsp;<br>influence we&nbsp;have examined so far:&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;<i>Reciprocity.&nbsp;</i>To start, games are played and prizes won by the party goers; anyone who&nbsp;<br>doesn't&nbsp;win a prize gets to choose one from&nbsp;a grab bag so that everyone has received a&nbsp;<br>gift before the buying begins.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Commitment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Participants are urged to describe&nbsp;publicly the uses and benefits they&nbsp;<br>have found for the Tupperware they already own.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;<i>Social proof.&nbsp;</i>Once the buying begins, each&nbsp;purchase builds the idea that other, similar&nbsp;<br>people want the products; therefore, it must be good.&nbsp;<br>
All the weapons of influence are present to help things along, but the real power of the&nbsp;<br>Tupperware party comes from&nbsp;a particular arrangement that trades&nbsp;on the liking rule.&nbsp;<br>Despite the entertaining and&nbsp;persuasive selling skills of&nbsp;the Tupperware demonstrator,&nbsp;<br>the true&nbsp;request to purchase&nbsp;the product does not come&nbsp;from&nbsp;this&nbsp;stranger;&nbsp;it&nbsp;comes from&nbsp;<br>a friend to every person in&nbsp;the room. Oh, the Tupperware representative may physically&nbsp;<br>ask for each party goer's order, all right; but the more psychologically compelling&nbsp;<br>requester is sitting off to the side, smiling, chatting, and serving refreshments. She is the&nbsp;<br>party hostess, who has called her friends together for the demonstration in her home and&nbsp;<br>who, everyone knows, makes a profit from&nbsp;each piece sold at the party.&nbsp;<br>
By providing the hostess with&nbsp;a percentage of the take,&nbsp;the Tupperware Home&nbsp;Parties&nbsp;<br>Corporation arranges for its customers to buy from&nbsp;and for a friend rather than from an&nbsp;<br>unknown salesperson. In this way, the attraction, the warmth, the security, and the&nbsp;<br>obligation of friendship are brought to bear&nbsp;on the sales setting (Taylor, 1978). In fact,&nbsp;<br>consumer researchers who have examined the social ties between&nbsp;the hostess and the&nbsp;<br>party goers in home party sales settings have affirmed&nbsp;the power of the company's&nbsp;<br>approach: The strength of that social bond&nbsp;is twice as likely to determine product&nbsp;<br>purchase as is preference for the product itself (Frenzen&nbsp;&amp; Davis, 1990). The results&nbsp;<br>have been remarkable. It was recently estimated that Tupperware sales now exceed 2.5&nbsp;<br>million dollars a day! Indeed, Tupperware's success has spread around the world to&nbsp;<br>societies in Europe, Latin America, and Asia, where one's&nbsp;place in a network of friends&nbsp;<br>and family is more socially significant than in the United States (Markus &amp; Kitayama,&nbsp;<br>1991; Triandis, 1995). As a result, now less than a quarter of Tupperware sales take&nbsp;<br>place in North America.&nbsp;<br>

What is interesting is that the customers&nbsp;appear to be fully aware of&nbsp;the liking and&nbsp;<br>friendship pressures embodied in the Tupperware party. Some&nbsp;don't seem&nbsp;to mind;&nbsp;<br>others do, but don't seem to know how to avoid these pressures. One woman I spoke&nbsp;<br>with described her reactions with more than a bit of frustration in her voice.&nbsp;<br>
<i>It's gotten to the point now where I hate to be invited to&nbsp;Tupperware parties. I've got all&nbsp;<br>the containers I need; and if I wanted any more, I could buy another brand cheaper in&nbsp;<br>the store. But when a friend calls up, I feel like I have to go. And when I get there, I feel&nbsp;<br>like I have to buy something. What can I do? It's for one of my&nbsp;friends.</i>&nbsp;<br>
With so irresistible an ally as friendship, it is little wonder that the Tupperware&nbsp;<br>Corporation has abandoned retail sales outlets and is pushing the home party concept.&nbsp;<br>Statistics reveal that a Tupperware party&nbsp;now starts somewhere every 2.7 seconds. Of&nbsp;<br>course, all sorts of other compliance professionals recognize the pressure to say yes to&nbsp;<br>someone we know and like. Take, for instance, the growing number of charity&nbsp;<br>organizations that recruit&nbsp;volunteers to canvass for donations close to their own&nbsp;<br>

homes. They understand perfectly how much more difficult it is for us to turn down a&nbsp;<br>charity request when it comes from&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend or neighbor.&nbsp;<br>
Other compliance professionals have found that&nbsp;the friend doesn't&nbsp;even have to be&nbsp;<br>present to be effective; often, just the&nbsp;mention of the friends'&nbsp;name&nbsp;is enough. The&nbsp;<br>Shaklee Corporation, which specializes in&nbsp;door-to-door sales of various home-related&nbsp;<br>products, advises its salespeople to use&nbsp;the &quot;endless chain&quot; method for finding new&nbsp;<br>customers. Once a customer admits that he or she likes a product, that customer can be&nbsp;<br>pressed for the names of friends who would also appreciate learning about it. The&nbsp;<br>individuals on that list can then be approached for sales&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>a list of&nbsp;their friends, who&nbsp;<br>can serve as sources for still&nbsp;other potential customers, and&nbsp;so on in an endless chain.&nbsp;<br>
The key to&nbsp;the success of this method is&nbsp;that each new prospect is visited by a&nbsp;<br>salesperson armed with the name&nbsp;of a friend &quot;who suggested I call on you.&quot; Turning the&nbsp;<br>salesperson away under those circumstances is&nbsp;difficult; it's almost like rejecting the&nbsp;<br>friend. The Shaklee sales manual insists that&nbsp;employees use this system: &quot;It would be&nbsp;<br>impossible to overestimate its value.&nbsp;Phoning or calling&nbsp;on a prospect and&nbsp;<br>

being able to say that Mr. So-and-so, a friend of his, felt&nbsp;he would benefit by giving you&nbsp;<br>a few moments of his time&nbsp;is&nbsp;virtually as good as&nbsp;a sale 50 percent made before you&nbsp;<br>enter.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<b>READER'S REPORT 5.1 From a Chicago Man</b>&nbsp;<br>
Although I've never been to a Tupperware Party, I recognized&nbsp;the same&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;<br>friendship pressures recently when I got&nbsp;a call from&nbsp;a long distance phone company&nbsp;<br>saleswoman. She told me that one of my&nbsp;buddies had placed my&nbsp;name&nbsp;on something&nbsp;<br>called the &quot;MCI Friends and Family Calling Circle.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
This friend of mine, Brad, is&nbsp;a guy I grew up with but who moved to New Jersey last&nbsp;<br>year for&nbsp;a job. He still calls&nbsp;me pretty regularly to get the news on&nbsp;the guys we used to&nbsp;<br>hang out with. The saleswoman told me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;could save 20 percent on all the calls&nbsp;he&nbsp;<br>made to the people on his Calling-Circle&nbsp;list, provided they&nbsp;are MCI phone company&nbsp;<br>subscribers.&nbsp;Then she asked me if I wanted&nbsp;to&nbsp;switch to MCI to get all the blah,&nbsp;blah,&nbsp;<br>blah benefits of MCI service, and so that&nbsp;Brad could save 20 percent on his calls to me.&nbsp;<br>
Well, I couldn't have cared less about the benefits of MCI service; I was perfectly happy&nbsp;<br>with the long distance company I had. But the part about wanting to save Brad money&nbsp;<br>on our calls really got to&nbsp;me. For me&nbsp;to say that I didn't&nbsp;want to be in his Calling Circle&nbsp;<br>and didn't care about saving him money would have sounded like a real affront to our&nbsp;<br>friendship when he heard about it. So, to avoid insulting him, I told her to switch me&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>MCI.&nbsp;<br>
I used to wonder why women would go to a&nbsp;Tupperware Party just because a friend was&nbsp;<br>holding it, and then buy stuff they didn't want once they were there. I don't wonder&nbsp;<br>anymore.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Author's note:&nbsp;</b>This reader is not alone in being able to testify to&nbsp;the power&nbsp;of the pressures&nbsp;<br>embodied in&nbsp;MCI's Calling Circle idea. When&nbsp;</i>Consumer Reports&nbsp;<i>magazine inquired into the&nbsp;<br>practice, the&nbsp;MCI salesperson they interviewed&nbsp;was quite succinct:&nbsp;&quot;It works 9 out of 10 times,&quot;&nbsp;<br>he said.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<b>MAKING FRIENDS TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE</b>&nbsp;<br>
Compliance practitioners'&nbsp;widespread use of&nbsp;the liking bond between&nbsp;friends&nbsp;tells&nbsp;us&nbsp;<br>much about the power of the liking rule to&nbsp;produce assent. In fact, we find that such&nbsp;<br>professionals seek to benefit from&nbsp;the rule&nbsp;even when already formed friendships are not&nbsp;<br>present for them to employ. Under these circumstances, the professionals still make use&nbsp;<br>of the liking bond by employing a&nbsp;compliance strategy that is quite direct: They first get&nbsp;<br>us to like&nbsp;<i>them.</i>&nbsp;<br>
There is&nbsp;a man in Detroit, Joe&nbsp;Girard, who specialized&nbsp;in using the&nbsp;liking rule to&nbsp;sell&nbsp;<br>Chevrolets. He became wealthy in&nbsp;the process, making over $200,000 a year.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

With such a salary, we might guess that he&nbsp;was&nbsp;a high-level GM executive or perhaps&nbsp;<br>the owner of a Chevrolet dealership. But no.&nbsp;He&nbsp;made his money as a salesman on the&nbsp;<br>showroom&nbsp;floor. He was phenomenal at what he&nbsp;did. For twelve years straight, he won&nbsp;<br>the title of &quot;Number One Car Salesman&quot;; he averaged more than five cars and trucks&nbsp;<br>sold every day he worked; and he has been&nbsp;called the world's &quot;greatest car salesman&quot; by&nbsp;<br>the&nbsp;<i>Guinness Book of World Records.</i>&nbsp;<br>
For all his success, the formula he employed&nbsp;was surprisingly simple. It consisted of&nbsp;<br>offering people just two things: a fair price and someone they liked to buy from. &quot;And&nbsp;<br>that's it,&quot; he claimed in an&nbsp;interview. &quot;Finding the salesman&nbsp;you like, plus the price. Put&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;both together, and you get a deal.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Fine. The Joe Girard formula tells us how vital the liking rule is to&nbsp;his&nbsp;business, but it&nbsp;<br>doesn't&nbsp;tell us nearly enough. For one thing,&nbsp;it doesn't&nbsp;tell us why customers liked him&nbsp;<br>more than some&nbsp;other salesperson who offered a fair price. There is a crucial—and&nbsp;<br>fascinating—general question&nbsp;that Joe's formula leaves unanswered.&nbsp;What are the&nbsp;<br>factors that cause one person to like another?&nbsp;If we&nbsp;knew&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>answer, we would be a&nbsp;<br>long way toward understanding how&nbsp;people such&nbsp;as Joe can&nbsp;so successfully arrange to&nbsp;<br>have us like them&nbsp;and, conversely, how we might successfully arrange to have others&nbsp;<br>like us. Fortunately, social scientists&nbsp;have&nbsp;been asking this question for decades. Their&nbsp;<br>accumulated evidence has allowed them&nbsp;to identify a number of factors that reliably&nbsp;<br>cause liking.&nbsp;As we will see, each is cleverly used&nbsp;by compliance professionals to urge&nbsp;<br>us along the road to &quot;yes.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<b>WHY DO I LIKE YOU? LET ME LIST THE REASONS&nbsp;<i>Physical Attractiveness</i></b>&nbsp;<br>
Although it is generally acknowledged that good-looking people have an advantage in&nbsp;<br>social interaction, recent findings indicate that we may have sorely underestimated the&nbsp;<br>size and&nbsp;reach of that advantage. There seems to be a&nbsp;<i>click, whirr&nbsp;</i>response to attractive&nbsp;<br>people. Like all&nbsp;<i>click, whirr&nbsp;</i>reactions, it happens automatically, without forethought.&nbsp;<br>The response itself falls into a category that social&nbsp;scientists call&nbsp;<i>halo effects.&nbsp;</i>A halo&nbsp;<br>effect occurs when one positive characteristic&nbsp;of&nbsp;a person dominates the way that person&nbsp;<br>is viewed by others. The evidence is now clear that physical&nbsp;attractiveness is often such&nbsp;<br>a characteristic.&nbsp;<br>
Research has shown that we automatically assign to good-looking individuals such&nbsp;<br>favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty,&nbsp;and intelligence (for a review of this&nbsp;<br>evidence, see Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani, &amp; Longo, 1991). Furthermore, we make&nbsp;<br>these judgments without being aware that physical attractiveness plays a role in the&nbsp;<br>process. Some&nbsp;consequences of this unconscious assumption that&nbsp;&quot;good-looking equals&nbsp;<br>good&quot; scare me. For example, a study of the&nbsp;1974 Canadian federal elections found that&nbsp;<br>attractive candidates received more than two&nbsp;and a half times as many votes as&nbsp;<br>unattractive candidates (Efran &amp; Patterson, 1976). Despite such evidence of favoritism&nbsp;<br>toward handsome politicians, follow-up research demon-&nbsp;<br>
<i>&nbsp;</i><br>
<i>&nbsp;</i><br>

strated that voters did not realize their bias. In fact, 73 percent of Canadian voters&nbsp;<br>surveyed denied in the strongest possible terms that their votes had been influenced by&nbsp;<br>physical appearance; only 14 percent even allowed for the possibility of such influence&nbsp;<br>(Efran &amp; Patterson, 1976). Voters&nbsp;can deny the impact of attractiveness on&nbsp;electability&nbsp;<br>all they want, but evidence has continued to&nbsp;confirm&nbsp;its troubling presence (Budesheim&nbsp;<br>&amp; DePaola, 1994).&nbsp;<br>
A similar effect has been found in hiring&nbsp;situations. In one study, good grooming of&nbsp;<br>applicants in a simulated employment interview accounted for more favorable hiring&nbsp;<br>decisions than did job qualifications—this,&nbsp;even though the interviewers claimed that&nbsp;<br>appearance played a small role in their choices (Mack&nbsp;&amp; Rainey, 1990). The advantage&nbsp;<br>given to attractive workers extends past&nbsp;hiring day to payday. Economists examining&nbsp;<br>U.S. and Canadian samples have found that attractive individuals get&nbsp;paid an average of&nbsp;<br>12-14 percent more than their unattractive&nbsp;coworkers (Ham-mermesh &amp; Biddle, 1994).&nbsp;<br>
Equally unsettling research indicates that&nbsp;our judicial&nbsp;process is&nbsp;similarly susceptible to&nbsp;<br>the influences of body dimensions and bone structure. It now appears that good-looking&nbsp;<br>people are likely to receive highly favorable treatment in the legal system&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<br>Castellow, Wuensch, &amp; Moore, 1991; and Downs &amp; Lyons, 1990, for reviews). For&nbsp;<br>example, in a Pennsylvania study (Stewart, 1980), researchers&nbsp;rated the physical&nbsp;<br>attractiveness of 74 separate male defendants&nbsp;at the start of their criminal trials. When,&nbsp;<br>much later, the researchers checked&nbsp;court records for the results of these cases, they&nbsp;<br>found that the handsome men had received significantly lighter sentences. In fact,&nbsp;<br>attractive defendants were twice as likely&nbsp;to avoid jail as unattractive defendants.1&nbsp;In&nbsp;<br>another study—this one on the damages awarded in a staged negligence trial—a&nbsp;<br>defendant who was better looking than his&nbsp;victim&nbsp;was assessed an average amount of&nbsp;<br>$5,623; but when the victim&nbsp;was&nbsp;more&nbsp;attractive of the two,&nbsp;<br>
'This finding—that attractive defendants, even&nbsp;when they&nbsp;are found guilty,&nbsp;are less&nbsp;<br>likely to be sentenced to prison—helps&nbsp;explain one fascinating experiment in&nbsp;<br>criminology (Kurtzburg, Safar, &amp; Cavior, 1968). Some New York City jail inmates with&nbsp;<br>facial disfigurements underwent plastic surgery while incarcerated; other inmates with&nbsp;<br>similar disfigurements did not. Furthermore, some&nbsp;members of each group received&nbsp;<br>services (such as counseling, training, etc.) designed to rehabilitate them to society. One&nbsp;<br>year after the inmates had been released from&nbsp;jail, a check of&nbsp;the records revealed that&nbsp;<br>(except for heroin addicts) criminals given&nbsp;the cosmetic surgery were significantly less&nbsp;<br>likely to have returned to&nbsp;jail. The most interesting feature of&nbsp;this finding was that it was&nbsp;<br>equally true for those inmates who had not&nbsp;received the traditional rehabilitative&nbsp;<br>services and for those who had. Apparently, some criminologists then argued that when&nbsp;<br>it comes to ugly inmates, prisons would be better off to abandon the costly rehabilitation&nbsp;<br>services they typically provide and offer plastic surgery instead; the surgery seems to be&nbsp;<br>at least as effective and&nbsp;decidedly less expensive.&nbsp;<br>
The importance of the Pennsylvania data (Stewart, 1980) is that it suggests that the&nbsp;<br>argument for surgery as a means of rehabilitation may be faulty. Making ugly criminals&nbsp;<br>more attractive may not reduce the chances that&nbsp;they will commit another crime; it may&nbsp;<br>only reduce their chances of&nbsp;being sent to jail for it.&nbsp;<br>

the average compensation was $10,051. What's&nbsp;more, both male and female jurors&nbsp;<br>exhibited the attractiveness-based&nbsp;favoritism&nbsp;(Kulka &amp; Kessler, 1978).&nbsp;<br>
Other experiments have demonstrated that&nbsp;attractive&nbsp;people&nbsp;are more likely to&nbsp;obtain&nbsp;<br>help when in need (Benson, Karabenic, &amp;&nbsp;Lerner, 1976) and are more persuasive in&nbsp;<br>changing the opinions of an audience (Chaiken, 1979). Here, too, both sexes respond in&nbsp;<br>the same&nbsp;way. In the Benson et al. study on helping, for instance, the better-looking men&nbsp;<br>and women received aid more often, even&nbsp;from members of their own sex. A major&nbsp;<br>exception to this rule might be expected to&nbsp;occur, of course, if&nbsp;the attractive person is&nbsp;<br>viewed as a direct competitor, especially a&nbsp;romantic rival. Short of this qualification,&nbsp;<br>though, it is apparent that good-looking people&nbsp;enjoy an enormous social advantage in&nbsp;<br>our culture. They are better&nbsp;liked, more persuasive, more frequently helped, and seen as&nbsp;<br>possessing more desirable personality traits&nbsp;and&nbsp;greater&nbsp;intellectual capacities. It appears&nbsp;<br>that the social benefits of good looks begin to accumulate quite early. Research on&nbsp;<br>elementary school children shows&nbsp;that adults view aggressive&nbsp;acts as less naughty when&nbsp;<br>performed by an attractive child (Dion, 1972)&nbsp;and that teachers presume good-looking&nbsp;<br>children to be more intelligent than&nbsp;their less&nbsp;attractive&nbsp;classmates (Ritts, Patterson,&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<br>Tubbs, 1992).&nbsp;<br>
It is hardly any wonder, then, that the halo of physical&nbsp;attractiveness is regularly&nbsp;<br>exploited by&nbsp;compliance professionals. Because&nbsp;we like attractive people, and because&nbsp;<br>we tend to comply with those we&nbsp;like, it&nbsp;makes sense that sales training programs&nbsp;<br>include grooming hints, fashionable clothiers select their floor staffs from&nbsp;among the&nbsp;<br>good-looking candidates, and con&nbsp;men and women are attractive.2&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Similarity</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
What if physical appearance is not much&nbsp;at issue?&nbsp;After all, most people possess&nbsp;<br>average looks. Are there other factors that can&nbsp;be used to&nbsp;produce liking?&nbsp;As both&nbsp;<br>researchers and compliance professionals know,&nbsp;there are several, and one of the most&nbsp;<br>influential is&nbsp;similarity.&nbsp;<br>
<i>We like people who are similar to us&nbsp;</i>(Byrne, 1971). This fact seems to hold true&nbsp;<br>whether the similarity is in the area of&nbsp;opinions, personality&nbsp;traits, background, or&nbsp;<br>lifestyle. Consequently, those who want us to&nbsp;like them&nbsp;so that we will comply with&nbsp;<br>
2Have you ever noticed that despite their&nbsp;good looks, many attractive people don't seem&nbsp;<br>to share the positive impressions of&nbsp;their personalities and abilities that observers have?&nbsp;<br>Research has not only confirmed the tenuous&nbsp;and inconsistent relationship between&nbsp;<br>attractiveness and self-esteem&nbsp;(see Adams, 1977), it has also offered a possible&nbsp;<br>explanation. One set of&nbsp;authors has produced evidence suggesting that good-looking&nbsp;<br>people are aware that other people's positive evaluations of&nbsp;them&nbsp;are not based on their&nbsp;<br>actual traits&nbsp;and abilities&nbsp;but are often caused&nbsp;by an&nbsp;attractiveness &quot;halo&quot; (Major,&nbsp;<br>Carrington, &amp; Carnevale, 1984). Consequently,&nbsp;many attractive people who are exposed&nbsp;<br>to this confusing information may be&nbsp;left&nbsp;with an uncertain self-concept.&nbsp;<br>

them&nbsp;can accomplish that purpose by&nbsp;appearing similar to us&nbsp;in a wide variety of ways.&nbsp;<br>
Dress is a good example. Several studies have&nbsp;demonstrated that we are more likely to&nbsp;<br>help those who dress like us. In one&nbsp;study, done in the early 1970s when young people&nbsp;<br>tended to dress in either &quot;hippie&quot; or &quot;straight&quot; fashion, experimenters donned hippie or&nbsp;<br>straight attire and asked college students on campus for a dime to make a phone call.&nbsp;<br>When the experimenter was dressed in the&nbsp;same&nbsp;way as the student, the request was&nbsp;<br>granted in more than two-thirds of&nbsp;the instances; when the student and requester were&nbsp;<br>dissimilarly dressed, the dime was provided&nbsp;less than half the time (Emswiller, Deaux,&nbsp;<br>&amp; Willits,&nbsp;1971). Another experiment showed how automatic our positive response to&nbsp;<br>similar others can be. Marchers in an antiwar demonstration were found to be more&nbsp;<br>likely to sign&nbsp;the petition of&nbsp;a similarly dressed requester&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>to do so without bothering&nbsp;<br>to read it first (Suedfeld, Bochner, &amp; Matas, 1971).&nbsp;<i>Click, whirr.</i>&nbsp;<br>
Another way requesters can manipulate similarity to increase liking and&nbsp;compliance&nbsp;is&nbsp;<br>to claim&nbsp;that they have backgrounds and interests similar to ours. Car salespeople, for&nbsp;<br>example, are trained to look for evidence of&nbsp;such things while examining a customer's&nbsp;<br>trade-in. If there is camping gear in the&nbsp;trunk, the salespeople might mention, later on,&nbsp;<br>how they love to get away from&nbsp;the city whenever they&nbsp;can; if there are golf balls on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>back seat, they might remark that they hope&nbsp;the rain will hold off until they can play the&nbsp;<br>eighteen holes they scheduled for&nbsp;later in the day; if&nbsp;they notice that the car&nbsp;was&nbsp;<br>purchased&nbsp;out of state, they might ask where a customer is from&nbsp;and report—with&nbsp;<br>surprise—that they (or their&nbsp;spouse) were born there, too.&nbsp;<br>
As trivial as these similarities may seem, they appear to work&nbsp;(Brewer, 1979; Tajfel,&nbsp;<br>1981). One researcher who examined the sales records of insurance companies found&nbsp;<br>that customers were more likely to buy insurance when a salesperson was like them in&nbsp;<br>age, religion, politics, and cigarette-smoking habits (Evans, 1963).&nbsp;Another researcher&nbsp;<br>was able to significantly&nbsp;increase the percentage of people who responded to a mailed&nbsp;<br>survey by changing one small feature of the request: On a cover letter, he modified the&nbsp;<br>name of&nbsp;the survey-taker&nbsp;to be similar to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;the survey&nbsp;recipient. Thus, Robert&nbsp;<br>Greer received the survey from&nbsp;a survey&nbsp;center official named Bob Gregar while&nbsp;<br>Cynthia Johnston received hers from a survey center official named Cindy Johanson. In&nbsp;<br>two separate studies, adding this&nbsp;little bit of similarity to the exchange nearly doubled&nbsp;<br>survey compliance (Garner, 1999). These seemingly minor commonalties can affect&nbsp;<br>decisions that go well beyond whose insurance to purchase or whose survey to&nbsp;<br>complete. They can affect the decision of whose&nbsp;life to save. When asked to rank-order&nbsp;<br>a waiting list of patients suffering from&nbsp;kidney disorder as&nbsp;to their deservingness for the&nbsp;<br>next available treatment, people chose those whose political party&nbsp;preference matched&nbsp;<br>their own (Furnham,&nbsp;1996).&nbsp;<br>
Because even small similarities can be effective in producing a positive response to&nbsp;<br>another and because a veneer of similarity can be so easily manufactured, I would&nbsp;<br>

advise special caution in the presence of&nbsp;requesters who claim&nbsp;to be &quot;just like you.&quot;3&nbsp;<br>Indeed, it would be wise these days to&nbsp;be careful around salespeople who just&nbsp;<i>seem&nbsp;</i>to&nbsp;<br>be just like you. Many sales training programs now urge trainees to &quot;mirror and match&quot;&nbsp;<br>the customer's body posture, mood, and verbal style, as similarities along each of these&nbsp;<br>dimensions have been shown to lead to&nbsp;positive results (Chartrand &amp; Bargh, 1999;&nbsp;<br>Locke &amp; Horowitz, 1990; Woodside &amp; Davenport, 1974).&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Compliments</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Actor McLean Stevenson once described how his wife tricked him&nbsp;into marriage: &quot;She&nbsp;<br>said she liked me.&quot; Although designed for a laugh, the remark is as instructive as it is&nbsp;<br>humorous. The information that someone fancies us can be a bewitchingly effective&nbsp;<br>device for producing return liking and willing&nbsp;compliance (Berscheid &amp; Walster, 1978;&nbsp;<br>Howard, Gengler, &amp; Jain, 1995, 1997). So, often when people flatter us or claim&nbsp;affinity&nbsp;<br>for us, they want something from&nbsp;us.&nbsp;<br>
Remember Joe Girard, the world's &quot;greatest car salesman,&quot; who says&nbsp;the secret of his&nbsp;<br>success was&nbsp;getting customers to like him?&nbsp;He&nbsp;did something that, on&nbsp;the face of it,&nbsp;<br>seems foolish and costly. Each month he sent every one of his more than 13,000 former&nbsp;<br>customers a holiday greeting card containing a printed message. The holiday greeting&nbsp;<br>card changed from&nbsp;month to month (Happy New Year, Happy Valentine's Day, Happy&nbsp;<br>Thanksgiving, and so on), but the message printed on the face of the card never varied.&nbsp;<br>It read, &quot;I like you.&quot; As Joe explained it, &quot;There's nothing else on&nbsp;the card, nothin'&nbsp;but&nbsp;<br>my name. I'm just telling 'em&nbsp;that I like 'em.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&quot;I like you.&quot; It came in the mail every year, 12 times a year, like clockwork. &quot;I like&nbsp;<br>you,&quot; on a printed card that went to 13,000 other people, too. Could a statement of&nbsp;<br>liking so impersonal, obviously designed to&nbsp;sell cars, really&nbsp;work: Joe Girard thought&nbsp;<br>so, and a man as successful as he was at&nbsp;what he did deserves&nbsp;our attention. Joe&nbsp;<br>understood an important fact about human&nbsp;nature: we are phenomenal&nbsp;suckers for&nbsp;<br>flattery. Although there are limits to our gullibility—especially when we can be sure&nbsp;<br>that the flatterer is trying to manipulate us (Jones &amp; Wortman, 1973)—we tend, as a&nbsp;<br>rule, to believe praise&nbsp;and to like&nbsp;those who&nbsp;provide it, often&nbsp;when&nbsp;it is probably untrue&nbsp;<br>(Byrne, Rasche, &amp; Kelley, 1974).&nbsp;<br>
An experiment done on a group of men in&nbsp;North Carolina shows how helpless we can&nbsp;<br>be in the face of praise. The men in the&nbsp;study received comments about themselves from&nbsp;<br>another person who needed a favor from&nbsp;them. Some of the men got&nbsp;only positive&nbsp;<br>comments, some&nbsp;got only negative comments,&nbsp;and some got a mixture of good and bad.&nbsp;<br>There were three interesting findings. First,&nbsp;the evaluator who provided only praise was&nbsp;<br>liked best by the men. Second, this&nbsp;tendency held true even when&nbsp;<br>
Additional work suggests yet&nbsp;another reason for caution when dealing with similar&nbsp;<br>requesters: we typically underestimate the degree to which similarity affects our liking&nbsp;<br>for another (Gon-zales, Davis,&nbsp;Loney, Lukens, &amp; Junghans, 1983).&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
the men fully realized that the flatterer stood to gain from their liking him. Finally,&nbsp;<br>unlike the other types of comments, pure praise did not have&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;accurate&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;work.&nbsp;<br>Positive&nbsp;comments produced just as much liking for the&nbsp;flatterer when they were&nbsp;untrue&nbsp;<br>as when they were true (Drachman, deCarufel, &amp; Insko, 1978).&nbsp;<br>
Apparently&nbsp;we have such&nbsp;an automatically&nbsp;positive reaction to compliments that we can&nbsp;<br>fall victim&nbsp;to someone who uses them&nbsp;in&nbsp;an obvious attempt to win our favor.&nbsp;<i>Click,&nbsp;<br>whirr.&nbsp;</i>When seen in this light, the expense&nbsp;of printing and mailing well over 150,000 &quot;I&nbsp;<br>like you&quot; cards each year seems neither as&nbsp;foolish nor as costly as before.&nbsp;<br>

<i><b>Contact and Cooperation</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
For the most part, we like things that are familiar to us (Zajonc, 1968).&nbsp;To prove the&nbsp;<br>point to yourself, try a little experiment. Get the negative of an old photograph that&nbsp;<br>shows a front view of your face and&nbsp;have it&nbsp;developed into a pair&nbsp;of pictures—one that&nbsp;<br>shows you as you actually look&nbsp;and one that shows a reverse image (so that the right&nbsp;<br>and left sides of your face are interchanged). Now decide&nbsp;which version of your face&nbsp;<br>you like better and ask a good friend to make&nbsp;the choice, too. If you&nbsp;are at all like the&nbsp;<br>group of Milwaukee women on whom&nbsp;this&nbsp;procedure was tried, you should notice&nbsp;<br>something odd: Your friend will prefer the true print, but you will&nbsp;prefer the reverse&nbsp;<br>image. Why?&nbsp;Because&nbsp;you&nbsp;<i>both&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>will be responding favorably to the&nbsp;more familiar&nbsp;<br>face—your friend to the one the world sees and you to the&nbsp;transposed one you find in&nbsp;<br>the mirror every day (Mita,&nbsp;Dernier, &amp; Knight, 1977).&nbsp;<br>
Because of its effect on&nbsp;liking,&nbsp;familiarity&nbsp;plays a role in decisions about all sorts&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>things, including the politicians we elect&nbsp;(Grush, 1980; Grush, McKeough, &amp; Ahlering,&nbsp;<br>1978). It appears that in an election booth voters often choose a candidate merely&nbsp;<br>because&nbsp;the&nbsp;name seems familiar. In&nbsp;one controversial Ohio&nbsp;election a few years ago,&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>man given little chance of winning&nbsp;the state attorney-general race swept to victory&nbsp;<br>when, shortly before the election, he changed his name&nbsp;to Brown—a family name&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>much Ohio political tradition.&nbsp;<br>
How could such a thing&nbsp;happen?&nbsp;The answer lies partially in the unconscious way that&nbsp;<br>familiarity affects liking. Often we don't realize that our attitude toward&nbsp;something has&nbsp;<br>been influenced by the number of times we&nbsp;have been exposed to it in the past. For&nbsp;<br>example, in one experiment, the faces of several individuals were flashed&nbsp;on a screen so&nbsp;<br>quickly that,&nbsp;later on, the subjects who were exposed to the faces in this manner couldn't&nbsp;<br>recall having seen any of them&nbsp;before. Yet,&nbsp;the more frequently a person's face was&nbsp;<br>flashed on the screen, the more these subjects came to like that person when they met in&nbsp;<br>a subsequent&nbsp;interaction.&nbsp;And because greater liking leads to greater social influence,&nbsp;<br>these subjects were also&nbsp;more persuaded&nbsp;by the opinion statements of the individuals&nbsp;<br>whose faces had appeared on the screen most&nbsp;frequently (Bornstein, Leone, &amp; Galley,&nbsp;<br>1987).&nbsp;<br>
On the basis&nbsp;of evidence that&nbsp;we are more favorably disposed&nbsp;toward the things we have&nbsp;<br>had contact with, some&nbsp;people have recommended a &quot;contact&quot; approach to improving&nbsp;<br>race relations. They argue that, simply by&nbsp;providing individuals&nbsp;of different ethnic&nbsp;<br>backgrounds with more exposure to one another as equals, those individuals will&nbsp;<br>naturally come to like each other better. However, when&nbsp;scientists have examined&nbsp;<br>school integration—the area offering the single best test of&nbsp;the contact approach—they&nbsp;<br>have discovered quite the opposite pattern.&nbsp;School desegregation is more likely to&nbsp;<br>increase prejudice between&nbsp;blacks and whites than to&nbsp;decrease it (Stephan, 1978).&nbsp;<br>
Let's stay with the issue of&nbsp;school desegregation for a while. However well in-tentioned&nbsp;<br>the proponents of interracial harmony through&nbsp;simple contact are, their approach is&nbsp;<br>unlikely to bear fruit because&nbsp;the argument on which it is based is terribly misinformed&nbsp;<br>(Gerard, 1983; Maruyama, Miller, &amp; Holtz, 1986). First of all, research&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=165></a><i>Liking&nbsp;</i>155&nbsp;<br>
has shown that the school setting is not a&nbsp;melting pot where children interact as readily&nbsp;<br>with members of other ethnic groups as they do with their own. Years after formal&nbsp;<br>school integration, there is little social integration. The students clot together ethnically,&nbsp;<br>separating themselves, for the most part, from&nbsp;other groups (Rogers, Hen-nigan,&nbsp;<br>Bowman, &amp;&nbsp;Miller, 1984; Oskamp &amp; Schultz, 1998). Second, even if there were much&nbsp;<br>more interethnic interaction, research shows that becoming familiar with something&nbsp;<br>through repeated contact doesn't&nbsp;necessarily cause&nbsp;greater liking (Gaert-ner et al., 1999).&nbsp;<br>In fact, continued exposure to a person or object under unpleasant conditions such&nbsp;as&nbsp;<br>frustration, conflict,&nbsp;or competition leads&nbsp;to&nbsp;less&nbsp;liking (Burgess&nbsp;&amp; Sales, 1971; Swap,&nbsp;<br>1977; Zajonc, Markus, &amp; Wilson, 1974). The&nbsp;typical American classroom&nbsp;fosters&nbsp;<br>precisely these unpleasant conditions.&nbsp;<br>
Consider the illuminating report of psychologist Elliot Aronson, called in to consult&nbsp;<br>with school authorities on problems in&nbsp;the Austin, Texas, schools. His description of the&nbsp;<br>way he found education proceeding in the standard classroom&nbsp;could apply to nearly any&nbsp;<br>public school in the United States:&nbsp;<br>
<i>In general, here is how it works: The teacher stands in front of the class and asks a&nbsp;<br>question. Six to ten children strain in their seats and wave their hands in the teacher's&nbsp;<br>face, eager to be called on and show how smart they are. Several others sit quietly with&nbsp;<br>eyes averted, trying to&nbsp;become invisible. When the teacher calls on&nbsp;one child, you see&nbsp;<br>looks of disappointment and dismay on the faces of the eager students, who missed a&nbsp;<br>chance to get the teacher's approval; and you will see relief on the faces of the others&nbsp;<br>who didn't know the answer.... This game is fiercely competitive and the stakes are high,&nbsp;<br>because the kids are competing for the love and approval of one of the two or three&nbsp;<br>most important people in their world.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>Further, this teaching process guarantees that&nbsp;the children&nbsp;will not learn to like and&nbsp;<br>understand each other. Conjure up your own experience. If you knew the right answer&nbsp;<br>and the teacher called on someone else, you&nbsp;probably hoped that he or she would make&nbsp;<br>a mistake so that you would have a chance&nbsp;to display your knowledge. If you were&nbsp;<br>called&nbsp;on and failed, or if you&nbsp;didn 't even&nbsp;raise your&nbsp;hand to compete, you probably&nbsp;<br>envied and resented your classmates who knew the answer.&nbsp;Children who fail in this&nbsp;<br>system become jealous and resentful of the successes, putting them down as teacher's&nbsp;<br>pets or even resorting to violence against&nbsp;them in the school yard. The successful&nbsp;<br>students,&nbsp;for&nbsp;their&nbsp;part, often hold the unsuccessful children in contempt, calling them&nbsp;<br>&quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;stupid.&quot; (Aronson, 1975, pp. 44, 47)</i>&nbsp;<br>
Should we wonder, then, why strict school&nbsp;desegregation—whether by enforced busing,&nbsp;<br>district rezoning, or school closures—so frequently produces increased rather than&nbsp;<br>decreased prejudice? When our children find&nbsp;their&nbsp;pleasant&nbsp;social and friendship&nbsp;<br>contacts within their ethnic boundaries and get repeated exposure to other groups only&nbsp;<br>in the competitive cauldron of the classroom, we&nbsp;might expect as much.&nbsp;<br>

Are there available solutions to this problem?&nbsp;One possibility might be to end our&nbsp;<br>attempts at school integration, but that hardly seems workable. Even if we were to&nbsp;<br>ignore the inevitable legal and constitutional&nbsp;challenges and the disruptive societal&nbsp;<br>wrangle such a retreat would provide, there are solid reasons for pursuing classroom&nbsp;<br>integration. For instance, although white students'&nbsp;achievement levels remain steady, it&nbsp;<br>is 10 times more likely that the academic&nbsp;performance of minority students will&nbsp;<br>significantly&nbsp;increase rather than significantly decline after desegregation (Stephan,&nbsp;<br>1978).&nbsp;<br>
We must be cautious in our approach to school desegregation so&nbsp;that we do not throw&nbsp;<br>out the baby&nbsp;with the&nbsp;bath water. The idea,&nbsp;of&nbsp;course, is&nbsp;to jettison just the water,&nbsp;<br>leaving the baby shining from&nbsp;the bath. Right now, though, our baby is soaking in the&nbsp;<br><i>Schmutzwasser&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>of increased racial hostility. Fortunately, real hope for draining away&nbsp;<br>that hostility&nbsp;is emerging from&nbsp;the research of&nbsp;education specialists into the concept of&nbsp;<br>&quot;cooperative learning.&quot; Because much of the heightened prejudice from&nbsp;classroom&nbsp;<br>desegregation seems to stem&nbsp;from&nbsp;increased exposure to&nbsp;outside group members as&nbsp;<br>rivals, these educators have experimented&nbsp;with forms of learning in which cooperation&nbsp;<br>rather&nbsp;than competition with classmates is central.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Off to Camp</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
To understand the logic of the cooperative&nbsp;approach, it helps to reexamine the&nbsp;<br>fascinating, four-decade-old research&nbsp;program&nbsp;of Turkish-born social scientist Muzafer&nbsp;<br>Sherif and his colleagues (Sherif, Harvey,&nbsp;White, Hood, &amp; Sherif, 1961). Intrigued with&nbsp;<br>the issue of intergroup conflict,&nbsp;the research team&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;investigate the process as it&nbsp;<br>developed in boys'&nbsp;summer camps. Although the boys never realized that they were&nbsp;<br>participants in an experiment, Sherif and his associates consistently engaged in artful&nbsp;<br>manipulations of the camp's social environment to observe the effects on group&nbsp;<br>relations. What the researchers learned is that it didn't take much to bring on certain&nbsp;<br>kinds of ill will. Simply separating&nbsp;the&nbsp;boys into&nbsp;two residence cabins was enough to&nbsp;<br>stimulate a &quot;we versus they&quot; feeling between&nbsp;the groups; letting the boys assign names&nbsp;<br>to the two groups (the Eagles&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Rattlers) accelerated&nbsp;the sense of rivalry. The boys&nbsp;<br>soon began to demean the qualities and accomplishments of the other group; however,&nbsp;<br>these forms of&nbsp;hostility were minor compared&nbsp;to what occurred when the experimenters&nbsp;<br>purposely introduced competitive activities into&nbsp;the groups'&nbsp;meetings with one another.&nbsp;<br>Cabin-against-cabin treasure hunts, tugs-of-war, and athletic contests produced name-<br>calling and confrontations. During the competitions, members of the opposing team&nbsp;<br>were labeled &quot;cheaters,&quot; &quot;sneaks,&quot; and &quot;stinkers.&quot; Afterward, cabins were raided, rival&nbsp;<br>banners were stolen and burned, threatening signs were posted, and lunchroom&nbsp;scuffles&nbsp;<br>were commonplace. At this point,&nbsp;it was evident to Sherif that&nbsp;the recipe for disharmony&nbsp;<br>was quick and easy: just separate the participants&nbsp;into groups and let them sit for a while&nbsp;<br>in their own juices. Then mix together&nbsp;over the flame of continued competition. And&nbsp;<br>there you have it: Cross-group&nbsp;hatred at a&nbsp;rolling boil.&nbsp;<br>
A more challenging issue then faced the&nbsp;experimenters: how to remove the now&nbsp;<br>entrenched hostility. They first tried&nbsp;the contact approach of bringing the bands together&nbsp;<br>more often. Even when the joint activities were pleasant, such&nbsp;as movies and&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=167></a><i>Liking&nbsp;</i>157&nbsp;<br>
social events, the results were disastrous. Picnics produced food fights, entertainment&nbsp;<br>programs gave way to shouting contests, dining-hall lines degenerated into shoving&nbsp;<br>matches. Sherif and his research team began&nbsp;to worry that, in Dr. Frankenstein fashion,&nbsp;<br>they might have created a monster they could&nbsp;no longer control. Then, at the height of&nbsp;<br>the strife, they tried a strategy that was at once simple and effective.&nbsp;<br>
They constructed a series of situations&nbsp;in which competition between the groups would&nbsp;<br>have harmed everyone's interest; instead, cooperation was necessary&nbsp;for mutual benefit.&nbsp;<br>On a day-long outing, the single truck available to go into town for food was &quot;found&quot; to&nbsp;<br>be stuck. The boys were assembled and all pulled and pushed together until the vehicle&nbsp;<br>was on its way. In another instance, the researchers arranged for an interruption of the&nbsp;<br>camp's water supply, which came&nbsp;through pipes from&nbsp;a distant tank. Presented with the&nbsp;<br>common crisis and realizing the need for unified action, the boys organized themselves&nbsp;<br>harmoniously to find and fix the problem&nbsp;before&nbsp;day's end. In&nbsp;yet another circumstance&nbsp;<br>requiring cooperation, the campers were informed that a desirable movie was available&nbsp;<br>for rental but that the camp could not afford it. Aware that the only solution was to&nbsp;<br>combine resources, the boys pooled their money&nbsp;for the film and spent a very congenial&nbsp;<br>evening together enjoying it.&nbsp;<br>
The consequences of these cooperative&nbsp;ventures though not&nbsp;instantaneous, were&nbsp;<br>nonetheless striking. Successful joint efforts toward common goals steadily bridged the&nbsp;<br>rift between the two groups. Before long, the&nbsp;verbal baiting had died, the jostling in&nbsp;<br>lines had ended, and the boys had begun to intermix at the meal tables. Further, when&nbsp;<br>asked to list&nbsp;their best friends,&nbsp;significant numbers changed&nbsp;from&nbsp;an earlier exclusive&nbsp;<br>naming of in-group chums to a listing that included boys in the other group. Some&nbsp;even&nbsp;<br>thanked the researchers for the opportunity to&nbsp;rate their friends again because they had&nbsp;<br>changed their minds since the earlier evaluation. In one revealing episode, the boys&nbsp;<br>were returning from&nbsp;a campfire on a single bus—something that would have produced&nbsp;<br>bedlam&nbsp;before but, at that point, was specifically requested by the boys. When the bus&nbsp;<br>stopped at a refreshment stand, the boys of one group, with&nbsp;$5 left in their treasury,&nbsp;<br>decided to treat their former bitter adversaries to milkshakes! We can trace the roots of&nbsp;<br>this surprising turnabout to those times when the boys had to&nbsp;view one another as allies&nbsp;<br>instead of opponents. The crucial procedure was the experimenters'&nbsp;imposition of&nbsp;<br>common goals on the groups. It was the cooperation required to&nbsp;achieve these goals that&nbsp;<br>finally allowed the rival group members to&nbsp;experience one another as reasonable&nbsp;<br>fellows, valued helpers, friends, and friends of&nbsp;friends (Wright, Aaron, McLaughlin-<br>Volpe, &amp; Ropp, 1997). When success resulted from&nbsp;the&nbsp;mutual efforts, it became&nbsp;<br>especially difficult to maintain feelings&nbsp;of hostility toward those who had been&nbsp;<br>teammates in the triumph.4&nbsp;<br>
You should not assume&nbsp;from&nbsp;these descriptions that successful cooperation works to&nbsp;<br>reduce intergroup hostility only among school-age children. Subsequent research has&nbsp;<br>found similar results of similar procedures in college groups (Worchel, 1979) and&nbsp;<br>business organizations (Blake &amp; Mouton, 1979). In these and most all groups,&nbsp;<br>cooperation not only leads to greater liking&nbsp;but to greater group success (Stanne, D. W.&nbsp;<br>Johnson, &amp; R. T. Johnson, 1999).&nbsp;<br>

<i><b>Back to School</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
In the welter of racial tensions that followed school desegregation, certain educational&nbsp;<br>psychologists began to see the relevance to the classroom&nbsp;in Sherif et al.'s findings. If&nbsp;<br>only the learning experience there could be modified to include at least occasional&nbsp;<br>interethnic cooperation toward mutual successes, perhaps cross-group friendships would&nbsp;<br>have a place to grow. Although similar projects&nbsp;have been under way in various states&nbsp;<br>(S. W. Cook, 1990, DeVries &amp; Slavin, 1978;&nbsp;D. W. Johnson &amp; R. T&nbsp;Johnson, 1983;&nbsp;<br>Oskamp &amp; Schultz, 1998), an especially interesting approach in this direction—termed&nbsp;<br>the jigsaw classroom—was developed by Elliot Aronson and his colleagues in Texas&nbsp;<br>and California (Aronson, Stephan, Sikes, Blaney, &amp; Snapp, 1978).&nbsp;<br>
The essence of the jigsaw route to learning is&nbsp;to require that students work together to&nbsp;<br>master the material to be tested on an upcoming examination. This end is accomplished&nbsp;<br>by grouping students into cooperating teams&nbsp;and giving each student only part of the&nbsp;<br>information—one piece of the puzzle—necessary&nbsp;to pass the test. Under this system&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>students must take turns teaching and helping one another. Everyone needs everyone&nbsp;<br>else to do well. Like Sherif's campers working on tasks that could&nbsp;be successfully&nbsp;<br>accomplished only jointly, the students become allies rather than enemies.&nbsp;<br>
When tried&nbsp;in newly desegregated classrooms, the jigsaw approach has generated&nbsp;<br>impressive results. Studies have shown that,&nbsp;compared to other classrooms in the same&nbsp;<br>school using the traditional competitive method, jigsaw learning stimulated significantly&nbsp;<br>more friendship and less prejudice among ethnic groups. Besides this vital reduction in&nbsp;<br>hostility, there were other advantages: minority students'&nbsp;self-esteem,&nbsp;liking for school,&nbsp;<br>and test scores improved. The white students benefited, too. Their self-esteem&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br>liking for school went up, and their test performance was at least&nbsp;as high as that of&nbsp;<br>whites in traditional classes (Aronson, Bridgeman, &amp; Geffner, 1978a, 1978b).&nbsp;<br>
There is a tendency when faced with positive results like those from&nbsp;the jigsaw&nbsp;<br>classroom&nbsp;to&nbsp;become&nbsp;overly enthusiastic about a single, simple solution to a difficult&nbsp;<br>problem. Experience should tell us that such&nbsp;problems&nbsp;rarely&nbsp;yield to a&nbsp;simple remedy.&nbsp;<br>That is no doubt true in this case as well.&nbsp;Even within the boundaries of cooperative&nbsp;<br>learning procedures, the issues are complex (Rosenfield &amp; Stephan, 1981; Slavin,&nbsp;<br>1983). Before we can feel truly comfortable with the jigsaw, or any similar approach to&nbsp;<br>learning and liking, much more research is needed to determine how frequently, in what&nbsp;<br>size doses, at which ages, and in which sorts of groups cooperative strategies will work.&nbsp;<br>We also need to know the best way for&nbsp;teachers to institute new methods—provided&nbsp;<br>they will institute them&nbsp;at&nbsp;all. After all, not only&nbsp;are&nbsp;cooperative learning&nbsp;techniques a&nbsp;<br>radical departure from&nbsp;the traditional, familiar routine of most teachers, but they may&nbsp;<br>also threaten a teacher's&nbsp;sense of importance in the classroom by turning over much of&nbsp;<br>the instruction to the students. Finally, we&nbsp;must realize that&nbsp;competition has its place,&nbsp;<br>too. It can serve as a valuable motivator of&nbsp;desirable action and an&nbsp;important builder of&nbsp;<br>self-concept. The task, then, is not to eliminate aca-&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
demic competition but to break its monopoly in the classroom&nbsp;by introducing regular&nbsp;<br>cooperative techniques that include members of all ethnic groups and lead to successful&nbsp;<br>outcomes.&nbsp;<br>
Despite these qualifications, I&nbsp;cannot help but be encouraged by the evidence to date.&nbsp;<br>When I talk to my&nbsp;students, or even my&nbsp;neighbors and friends, about the prospects for&nbsp;<br>cooperative learning approaches, I can&nbsp;feel the optimism&nbsp;rise in me. The&nbsp;<br>
bhc schools have for so long been sources&nbsp;of discouraging news—sinking test scores,&nbsp;<br>teacher burnout, increasing crime, and of course, racial conflict. Now there is at least&nbsp;<br>one crack in the gloom, and I find myself genuinely excited about it.&nbsp;<br>
What's&nbsp;the point of this digression&nbsp;into&nbsp;the effects of school desegregation in race&nbsp;<br>relations? The point is&nbsp;to make two points.&nbsp;First, although the familiarity pro-luced by&nbsp;<br>contact usually leads to greater liking, the opposite occurs&nbsp;if the contact&nbsp;<br>
ties&nbsp;distasteful experiences with it.&nbsp;Therefore,&nbsp;when children of different racial groups&nbsp;<br>are thrown into the&nbsp;incessant, harsh&nbsp;competition of&nbsp;the standard American classroom,&nbsp;<br>we ought to—and do—see hostilities worsen. Second, the evidence that team-oriented&nbsp;<br>learning is an antidote to this disorder tells us about the heavy im-Pact of cooperation on&nbsp;<br>the liking process.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=170></a>160&nbsp;<i>Chapters</i>&nbsp;<br>
Before we assume&nbsp;that cooperation is a powerful cause of liking, we should first pass it&nbsp;<br>through what, to my mind, is the acid test: Do compliance practitioners systematically&nbsp;<br>use cooperation to get us&nbsp;to like them so that&nbsp;we will say yes to their requests?&nbsp;Do they&nbsp;<br>point it out when it exists naturally in a situation? Do they try to amplify it when it&nbsp;<br>exists only weakly?&nbsp;And, most&nbsp;instructive of all, do they manufacture it when it isn't&nbsp;<br>there at all?&nbsp;<br>
As it turns out, cooperation passes the test with flying colors. Compliance professionals&nbsp;<br>are forever attempting to establish that we and they are working for the same&nbsp;goals, that&nbsp;<br>we must &quot;pull together&quot;&nbsp;for mutual benefit, that&nbsp;they are, in&nbsp;essence, our&nbsp;<i>teammates.&nbsp;</i>A&nbsp;<br>host of&nbsp;examples is possible. Most&nbsp;are familiar, such as the new-car salespeople who&nbsp;<br>take our side and &quot;do battle&quot; with&nbsp;their bosses to secure us a good deal.5&nbsp;One rather&nbsp;<br>spectacular illustration occurs in a setting&nbsp;few of us would recognize firsthand, because&nbsp;<br>the professionals are police interrogators whose job is to&nbsp;induce suspects to&nbsp;confess to&nbsp;<br>crime.&nbsp;<br>
In recent years, the courts have imposed a variety of restrictions on the way police must&nbsp;<br>behave in handling suspected&nbsp;criminals, especially in seeking confessions.&nbsp;Many&nbsp;<br>procedures that, in the past, led to admissions of&nbsp;guilt can no longer be employed for&nbsp;<br>fear that they&nbsp;will result in cases being dismissed. As yet, however, the courts have&nbsp;<br>found nothing illegal in the police's use of subtle psychology. For this reason, criminal&nbsp;<br>interrogations have taken increasingly to the use of such ploys as the one they call Good&nbsp;<br>Cop/Bad Cop.&nbsp;<br>
Good Cop/Bad Cop works as follows: A young&nbsp;robbery suspect, for example, who has&nbsp;<br>been advised of his rights and is maintaining his innocence,&nbsp;is brought to a room&nbsp;to be&nbsp;<br>questioned by a pair of officers. One of the officers, either because the part suits him&nbsp;or&nbsp;<br>because it is merely his turn,&nbsp;plays the role&nbsp;of Bad Cop. Before the suspect even sits&nbsp;<br>down, Bad Cop curses &quot;the-son-of-a-bitch&quot; for&nbsp;the robbery. For the rest of the session&nbsp;<br>his words come&nbsp;only with snarls and growls.&nbsp;He kicks the prisoner's chair to emphasize&nbsp;<br>his points. When he looks at the suspect, he seems to see a mound of garbage. If the&nbsp;<br>suspect challenges Bad Cop's accusations&nbsp;or&nbsp;just refuses&nbsp;to answer them, Bad Cop&nbsp;<br>becomes livid. His rage&nbsp;soars. He swears he will do everything possible to assure a&nbsp;<br>maximum sentence. He says he has friends in&nbsp;the district&nbsp;attorney's office who will hear&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;him&nbsp;of the suspect's noncooperative attitude and will prosecute the case hard.&nbsp;<br>
At the outset of Bad Cop's performance, his partner, Good Cop, sits in the background.&nbsp;<br>Then, slowly, Good Cop starts to chip&nbsp;in. First he speaks only to Bad Cop,&nbsp;<br>
5In truth,&nbsp;little in the way of combat takes&nbsp;place when&nbsp;the salesman enters the manager's&nbsp;<br>office under such circumstances. Often, because the salesman knows exactly&nbsp;the price&nbsp;<br>below which he cannot go, he and the boss don't even speak. In one car dealership I&nbsp;<br>infiltrated while researching this book, it was common for a salesman to have a soft&nbsp;<br>drink or&nbsp;cigarette in silence while&nbsp;the boss&nbsp;continued working. After a seemly time, the&nbsp;<br>salesman would loosen his tie and return&nbsp;to his customers, looking weary but carrying&nbsp;<br>the deal he had just &quot;hammered out&quot; for them—the same&nbsp;deal he had in mind before&nbsp;<br>entering the boss'&nbsp;office.&nbsp;<br>

trying to temper the burgeoning anger. &quot;Calm&nbsp;down, Frank, calm&nbsp;down.&quot; But Bad Cop&nbsp;<br>shouts back, &quot;Don't tell me&nbsp;to calm&nbsp;down when&nbsp;he's lying right to my&nbsp;face! I hate these&nbsp;<br>lying bastards!&quot; A bit later, Good Cop actually&nbsp;says something in the suspect's behalf.&nbsp;<br>&quot;Take it easy, Frank, he's&nbsp;only a kid.&quot; Not much&nbsp;in the way of support, but compared to&nbsp;<br>the rantings of&nbsp;Bad Cop, the words&nbsp;fall like&nbsp;music on the prisoner's ears. Still, Bad Cop&nbsp;<br>is unconvinced. &quot;Kid?&nbsp;He's&nbsp;no kid. He's&nbsp;a punk. That's&nbsp;what he is, a punk. And I'll&nbsp;tell&nbsp;<br>you something else. He's over 18, and that's all&nbsp;I need to get his ass sent so far behind&nbsp;<br>bars they'll need a flashlight to find him.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Now Good Cop begins to speak directly to the suspect, calling him by his first name&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br>pointing out any positive details of the case. &quot;I'll tell you,&nbsp;Kenny, you're lucky that&nbsp;<br>nobody was hurt and you weren't armed. When you come&nbsp;up for sentencing, that'll look&nbsp;<br>good.&quot; If the suspect persists&nbsp;in claiming innocence, Bad&nbsp;Cop launches into another&nbsp;<br>tirade of curses and threats. This time&nbsp;Good Cop stops him, &quot;Okay, Frank,&quot; handing Bad&nbsp;<br>Cop some&nbsp;money, &quot;I think we could all use&nbsp;some&nbsp;coffee. How about getting us three&nbsp;<br>cups?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
When Bad Cop is gone, it's time for Good&nbsp;Cop's big scene: &quot;Look, man, I don't know&nbsp;<br>why, but my partner doesn't like you, and he's&nbsp;gonna try to get you.&nbsp;And he's&nbsp;gonna be&nbsp;<br>able to do it, because we've got enough evidence right now.&nbsp;And he's right about the&nbsp;<br>D.A.'s&nbsp;office going hard on guys who don't cooperate. You're looking at five years,&nbsp;<br>man, five years! Now, I don't want to see that happen to you. So if you admit you&nbsp;<br>robbed that place right now, before he gets back, I'll take charge of your case and put in&nbsp;<br>a good word for you to the D. A. If&nbsp;we work together on this, we can cut that five years&nbsp;<br>down to two, maybe one. Do us both a favor, Kenny. Just tell me&nbsp;how you did it, and&nbsp;<br>let's start working on getting you through this.&quot; A full confession frequently follows.&nbsp;<br>
Good Cop/Bad Cop works as well as it does for several reasons: The fear of long&nbsp;<br>incarceration is quickly instilled by Bad Cop's&nbsp;threats;&nbsp;the perceptual contrast&nbsp;principle&nbsp;<br>(see Chapter 1) ensures that compared&nbsp;to the raving, venomous Bad Cop, the&nbsp;<br>interrogator playing Good&nbsp;Cop will seem&nbsp;like an&nbsp;<i>especially&nbsp;</i>reasonable and kind person&nbsp;<br>(Kamisar, 1980); and because Good&nbsp;Cop has intervened repeatedly on&nbsp;the suspect's&nbsp;<br>behalf—has even spent his own money for&nbsp;a cup of coffee—the reciprocity rule&nbsp;<br>pressures for a return favor (Rafaeli&nbsp;&amp; Sutton, 1991). The main reason that the&nbsp;<br>technique is effective, though, is&nbsp;that it gives the&nbsp;suspect the idea that there is someone&nbsp;<br>on his side, someone with his welfare in mind, someone working together with him, for&nbsp;<br>him. In most&nbsp;situations, such a person would be viewed very favorably,&nbsp;but in&nbsp;the&nbsp;deep&nbsp;<br>trouble our robbery suspect finds&nbsp;himself, that person takes&nbsp;on the character of a savior.&nbsp;<br>And from&nbsp;savior, it is but a short&nbsp;step to trusted father confessor.&nbsp;<br>

my university to find someone who could&nbsp;answer his question—a question that had&nbsp;<br>always puzzled him&nbsp;but had recently&nbsp;begun to bother and depress him.&nbsp;<br>
&quot;I mean, it's crazy, isn't it?&nbsp;Everybody knows that I just report&nbsp;the weather,&nbsp;that I don't&nbsp;<br>order it, right?&nbsp;So how come&nbsp;I get so much&nbsp;flak when the weather's bad?&nbsp;During the&nbsp;<br>floods last year, I got hate mail! One guy threatened to shoot me&nbsp;if&nbsp;it didn't stop raining.&nbsp;<br>Christ, I'm&nbsp;still looking over my&nbsp;shoulder from&nbsp;that one. And the people I work with at&nbsp;<br>the station do it, too! Sometimes, right on the&nbsp;air, they'll zing me&nbsp;about a heat wave or&nbsp;<br>something. They have to know that I'm not responsible, but that doesn't&nbsp;seem&nbsp;to stop&nbsp;<br>them. Can you help me understand this,&nbsp;Doc?&nbsp;It's&nbsp;really getting me&nbsp;down.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
We made an&nbsp;appointment to talk in my&nbsp;office, where I tried to explain that he was the&nbsp;<br>victim&nbsp;of an ages-old&nbsp;<i>click, whirr&nbsp;</i>response that people have to&nbsp;things they perceive as&nbsp;<br>merely connected to one another. Instances of this&nbsp;response abound in modern life. I felt&nbsp;<br>that the example most likely to help the distressed weatherman would require a bit of&nbsp;<br>ancient history. I asked him to consider the&nbsp;precarious fate of the imperial messengers&nbsp;<br>of&nbsp;old Persia. Any such messenger assigned the&nbsp;role of&nbsp;military courier&nbsp;had special&nbsp;<br>cause to&nbsp;hope mightily&nbsp;for Persian&nbsp;battlefield&nbsp;successes. With news&nbsp;of victory in his&nbsp;<br>pouch, he would be treated as a hero upon his&nbsp;arrival at the palace. The food, drink, and&nbsp;<br>women of his choice were provided gladly and sumptuously. Should his message tell of&nbsp;<br>military disaster,&nbsp;though, the reception would be quite different: He was summarily&nbsp;<br>slain.&nbsp;<br>
I hoped that the point of this story would not&nbsp;be lost on the weatherman. I&nbsp;wanted him to&nbsp;<br>be aware of a fact that is&nbsp;as true today as&nbsp;it was in the time of&nbsp;ancient Persia: The nature&nbsp;<br>of bad news infects the teller. There is a natural human tendency to dislike a person who&nbsp;<br>brings us unpleasant information, even when&nbsp;that person did not cause the bad news.&nbsp;<br>The simple association with&nbsp;it is enough to stimulate our&nbsp;dislike (Manis, Cornell, &amp;&nbsp;<br>Moore, 1974).&nbsp;<br>
There was&nbsp;something else I hoped the weatherman would get from&nbsp;the historical&nbsp;<br>example. Not only was he joined in his predicament by centuries of other &quot;tellers,&quot; but&nbsp;<br>also, compared to some (such as the Persian messengers), he was very well-off. At the&nbsp;<br>end of our session, he said something to convince me that he appreciated this&nbsp;point quite&nbsp;<br>clearly. &quot;Doc,&quot; he said on his&nbsp;way out, &quot;I feel a lot better about my job now. I mean, I'm&nbsp;<br>in Phoenix where the sun shines 300 days a year, right? Thank God I don't do the&nbsp;<br>weather in Buffalo.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
The weatherman's&nbsp;parting comment reveals that&nbsp;he understood more than I had told him&nbsp;<br>about the principle that was influencing his viewers'&nbsp;liking for him. Being connected&nbsp;<br>with bad weather does have a negative effect, but being connected with sunshine should&nbsp;<br>do wonders for his popularity. And he was right. The principle of association is a&nbsp;<br>general one, governing both negative and positive connections.&nbsp;<i>An innocent association&nbsp;<br>with either bad things or&nbsp;good things will influence how people feel about us&nbsp;</i>(Lott &amp;&nbsp;<br>Lott, 1965).&nbsp;<br>
Our instruction about the way negative association works seems to have&nbsp;been primarily&nbsp;<br>undertaken by our parents. Remember how&nbsp;they are always warning us against&nbsp;<br>

playing with the bad kids down the street?&nbsp;Remember how they said it didn't matter&nbsp;if&nbsp;<br>we did nothing bad ourselves because, in&nbsp;the eyes of the neighborhood, we would be&nbsp;<br>&quot;known by the company we kept.&quot; Our parents were teaching us&nbsp;about guilt by&nbsp;<br>association—and they were giving us a lesson in the negative side of the principle of&nbsp;<br>association.&nbsp;And they were right.&nbsp;People do assume that we have the&nbsp;same personality&nbsp;<br>traits as our friends (Miller,&nbsp;Campbell, Twedt, &amp; O'Connell, 1966).&nbsp;<br>
As for the positive associations, it is the compliance professionals who teach the lesson.&nbsp;<br>They are incessantly trying to&nbsp;connect themselves or their&nbsp;products with the things we&nbsp;<br>like. Did you ever wonder what all those good-looking models&nbsp;are doing standing&nbsp;<br>around in the automobile ads?&nbsp;What the advertiser hopes they are&nbsp;doing is lending their&nbsp;<br>positive traits—beauty and desirability—to the cars. The advertiser is betting that we&nbsp;<br>will respond&nbsp;to the product in the same ways&nbsp;we respond to the attractive models merely&nbsp;<br>associated with it—and we do.&nbsp;<br>
In one study, men who saw a new-car ad that&nbsp;included a seductive female model rated&nbsp;<br>the&nbsp;<i>car&nbsp;</i>as faster, more appealing, more expensive-looking, and better-designed than did&nbsp;<br>men who viewed the same&nbsp;ad&nbsp;without the model. Yet when asked later, the men refused&nbsp;<br>to believe that the presence of the young woman had influenced their judgments (Smith&nbsp;<br>&amp; Engel, 1968).&nbsp;<br>
Although there are other examples (Bierley, McSweeney, &amp; Vannieuwkerk, 1985;&nbsp;<br>Gorn, 1982), perhaps the most intriguing evidence of the way the association principle&nbsp;<br>can unconsciously stimulate us to part with our money comes from&nbsp;a series of&nbsp;<br>investigations on credit cards&nbsp;and spending (Feinberg, 1986). Within modern life, credit&nbsp;<br>cards are a relatively new device with a psychologically noteworthy characteristic: They&nbsp;<br>allow us to get the immediate benefits of goods and services while deferring the costs&nbsp;<br>weeks into the future. Consequently, we are more likely&nbsp;to associate credit cards and the&nbsp;<br>insignias, symbols, and logos that represent them&nbsp;with the positive rather than the&nbsp;<br>negative aspects of spending.&nbsp;<br>
Consumer researcher Richard Feinberg wondered what effects the presence of such&nbsp;<br>credit cards and credit card materials had on&nbsp;our tendencies to spend. In a set of studies&nbsp;<br>done in West Lafayette, Indiana, he got&nbsp;some&nbsp;fascinating—and disturbing— results.&nbsp;<br>First, restaurant patrons gave&nbsp;larger tips when paying with&nbsp;a credit card instead of cash.&nbsp;<br>In a second study, college students were willing to spend an&nbsp;average of 29 percent more&nbsp;<br>money for mail-order catalog items when they&nbsp;examined the items in a room&nbsp;that&nbsp;<br>contained some MasterCard insignias; moreover, they had no&nbsp;awareness&nbsp;that the credit&nbsp;<br>card insignias were part of&nbsp;the experiment. A final study showed that when asked to&nbsp;<br>contribute to charity (the United Way), college students were&nbsp;markedly more likely to&nbsp;<br>give money if the room&nbsp;they were in contained MasterCard insignias&nbsp;than if&nbsp;it did&nbsp;not&nbsp;<br>(87 percent versus 33 percent). This last finding&nbsp;is simultaneously the most unsettling&nbsp;<br>and instructive concerning the power of&nbsp;the association principle to generate&nbsp;<br>compliance. Even though credit cards themselves were not used for the&nbsp;charity&nbsp;<br>donation, the mere presence of&nbsp;their symbol (with its attendant positive associations)&nbsp;<br>spurred people&nbsp;to&nbsp;spend more&nbsp;<i>cash.&nbsp;</i>This last phenomenon has been replicated in a pair&nbsp;<br>of restaurant studies in which patrons received&nbsp;their bills on tip trays that either did or&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=175></a><i>Liking&nbsp;</i>165&nbsp;<br>
did not contain a credit card insignia. The diners tipped significantly more in the&nbsp;<br>presence of the insignia, even when they&nbsp;paid with cash (McCall and Belmont, 1996).6&nbsp;<br>
Because the association principle works so well—and so unconsciously—&nbsp;<br>manufacturers regularly rush to connect their products with the current cultural rage.&nbsp;<br>During the days of the first American moon&nbsp;shot, everything from&nbsp;breakfast drink to&nbsp;<br>deodorant was sold with allusions to the American space program. In Olympiad years,&nbsp;<br>we are told precisely the official hair sprays and facial tissue of our Olympic teams.7&nbsp;<br>During the 1970s, when the magic cultural concept appeared to be &quot;naturalness,&quot; the&nbsp;<br>&quot;natural&quot; bandwagon was crowded to capacity. Sometimes the connections to&nbsp;<br>naturalness didn't even make sense: &quot;Change your hair color&nbsp;naturally&quot; urged one&nbsp;<br>popular TV&nbsp;commercial. Similarly, although it&nbsp;made great sense that sales of Mars&nbsp;<br>Rover toys would jump&nbsp;after a U.S. Pathfinder rocket landed the&nbsp;real thing on the red&nbsp;<br>planet in 1997, it made little sense that the&nbsp;same&nbsp;would happen for the sales of Mars&nbsp;<br>Candy Bars, which have nothing to do with the space project but are named after the&nbsp;<br>candy company's founder, Franklin Mars (White, 1997).&nbsp;<br>
The linking of celebrities to products is another way advertisers cash in on the&nbsp;<br>association principle. Professional athletes&nbsp;are paid to connect&nbsp;themselves&nbsp;to things that&nbsp;<br>can be directly relevant to their roles (sports shoes, tennis&nbsp;racquets, golf balls) or wholly&nbsp;<br>irrelevant (soft drinks, popcorn poppers, panty hose). The important thing for the&nbsp;<br>advertiser&nbsp;is&nbsp;to establish the connection;&nbsp;it&nbsp;doesn't have to be a logical one, just a&nbsp;<br>positive one.&nbsp;<br>
Of course, popular entertainers provide another form&nbsp;of desirability&nbsp;that manufacturers&nbsp;<br>have always paid dearly&nbsp;to tie to their goods. Recently, politicians have recognized the&nbsp;<br>ability of a celebrity linkage to sway voters.&nbsp;According to Democratic Party consultant&nbsp;<br>Tom&nbsp;Yamuda, who prepared a report titled&nbsp;&quot;Celebrities = Sell-Ebrities,&quot; movie star&nbsp;<br>endorsement is &quot;the very best way to get your wish to become&nbsp;law&quot; (Glass, 1997).&nbsp;<br>Presidential candidates&nbsp;assemble stables of well-known&nbsp;nonpo-litical figures who either&nbsp;<br>actively participate in, or merely lend their names to, a campaign. Even at state and&nbsp;<br>local levels, a similar game&nbsp;is played. Take as evidence&nbsp;<br>
Subsequent research by Feinberg (1990) strengthens the association explanation for his&nbsp;<br>results. He has found that the presence of credit card insignias in a&nbsp;room&nbsp;only facilitates&nbsp;<br>spending by&nbsp;people&nbsp;who have had&nbsp;a positive history with&nbsp;credit cards.&nbsp;Those who have&nbsp;<br>had a negative history with credit cards—because they've paid an above-average&nbsp;<br>number of interest charges in&nbsp;the previous year—do not show&nbsp;the facilitation effect. In&nbsp;<br>fact, these individuals are more conservative&nbsp;in their spending tendencies when in the&nbsp;<br>mere presence of credit card logos.&nbsp;<br>
The rights to such associations do not come&nbsp;cheaply. Corporate contributors spend&nbsp;<br>millions to win sponsorships for the Olympics. But this amount pales in comparison to&nbsp;<br>the many millions more these companies then spend to advertise their connection to the&nbsp;<br>event. Yet it may he that the largest dollar figure of all for the corporate sponsors is the&nbsp;<br>one on the profit line. A survey by&nbsp;<i>Advertising Age magazine&nbsp;</i>found that one-third of all&nbsp;<br>consumers interviewed said they would be more likely to purchase an item&nbsp;if&nbsp;it were&nbsp;<br>linked to the Olympics.&nbsp;<br>

If politicians are relative newcomers to the use of celebrity&nbsp;endorsements, they are old&nbsp;<br>hands at exploiting the association principle in&nbsp;other ways. For example, congressional&nbsp;<br>representatives invariably&nbsp;announce to the press the start of federal pro-&nbsp;<br>

jects that will bring new&nbsp;jobs or benefits&nbsp;to their home states; this tradition continues&nbsp;<br>even when the representative has had nothing to&nbsp;do with advancing the project or has, in&nbsp;<br>some&nbsp;cases, voted against it.&nbsp;<br>
<b>Does&nbsp;<i>the Name Pavlov Ring a Bell?</i></b>&nbsp;<br>
While politicians have long strained to associate themselves with the values of&nbsp;<br>motherhood, country, and apple pie, it may be&nbsp;in the last of these connections—to&nbsp;<br>food— that they have been most&nbsp;clever. For instance, it is&nbsp;White House tradition to try&nbsp;<br>to sway the votes of balking legislators&nbsp;over a meal. It can be a picnic lunch,&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>sumptuous breakfast, or an elegant dinner; but&nbsp;when an important bill is up for grabs,&nbsp;<br>out comes the silverware. Political fund-raising these days regularly involves the&nbsp;<br>presentation&nbsp;of food. Notice,&nbsp;too, that at the typical fund-raising dinner the speeches and&nbsp;<br>the appeals for further contributions and heightened effort never come&nbsp;before the meal&nbsp;<br>is served, only during or after. There are&nbsp;several advantages to&nbsp;this&nbsp;technique. For&nbsp;<br>example, time&nbsp;is saved and the reciprocity rule is engaged. The least recognized benefit,&nbsp;<br>however, may be the one uncovered in research conducted in the 1930s by the&nbsp;<br>distinguished psychologist&nbsp;Gregory Razran (1938).&nbsp;<br>
Using what he termed the &quot;luncheon technique,&quot; he found that&nbsp;his subjects become&nbsp;<br>fonder of the people and things&nbsp;they experienced while they&nbsp;were eating. In the example&nbsp;<br>most relevant for our purposes (Razran, 1940), subjects were presented with some&nbsp;<br>political statements they had rated once before. At the end of the experiment, after all&nbsp;<br>the political statements had been presented,&nbsp;Razran found that only certain of them&nbsp;had&nbsp;<br>gained in approval—those that had been shown while food was being eaten. These&nbsp;<br>changes in liking seem&nbsp;to have occurred unconsciously, since the subjects could not&nbsp;<br>remember which of the statements they&nbsp;had seen while the food was being served.8&nbsp;<br>
How did Razran come&nbsp;up with the luncheon technique?&nbsp;What made him think it would&nbsp;<br>work? The answer may lie in&nbsp;the dual scholarly roles he played during&nbsp;his career.&nbsp;Not&nbsp;<br>only was he a respected independent researcher, he was also one&nbsp;of the earliest&nbsp;<br>translators into English of the pioneering psychological literature of Russia. It was a&nbsp;<br>literature dedicated to the study of the association principle and dominated by the&nbsp;<br>thinking of a brilliant man, Ivan Pavlov.&nbsp;<br>
Although a scientist of broad and varied talent—he had, for&nbsp;instance, won a Nobel Prize&nbsp;<br>years earlier for his work on the digestive system—Pavlov's most important&nbsp;<br>experimental demonstration was simplicity itself. He showed that he could get an&nbsp;<br>animal's&nbsp;typical response to food (salivation) to be directed toward something&nbsp;<br>
To demonstrate that the principle of association also works for unpleasant experiences,&nbsp;<br>Razran (1940) included in his experiment a&nbsp;condition in which certain participants had&nbsp;<br>putrid odors Piped into the room&nbsp;while they&nbsp;were shown the political slogans. In this&nbsp;<br>case, approval ratings for the slogans declined.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=178></a>168&nbsp;<i>Chapters</i>&nbsp;<br>
irrelevant to food (a bell) merely by connecting the two things in the animal's&nbsp;<br>experience. If the presentation of food to a dog was always accompanied by the sound&nbsp;<br>of a bell, soon the dog would salivate to the bell alone, even&nbsp;when there was no food to&nbsp;<br>be had.&nbsp;<br>
It is not a long step from Pavlov's classic demonstration to Razran's&nbsp;luncheon technique.&nbsp;<br>Obviously, a normal reaction to food can be transferred to some&nbsp;other thing through the&nbsp;<br>process of raw association. Razran's&nbsp;insight&nbsp;was that there are many normal responses to&nbsp;<br>food besides salivation, one of them&nbsp;being a good and favorable feeling. Therefore, it is&nbsp;<br>possible to attach this pleasant feeling, this&nbsp;positive attitude, to anything (political&nbsp;<br>statements being only an example) that&nbsp;is closely associated with good food.&nbsp;<br>
Nor is there a long step from&nbsp;the luncheon technique to the compliance professionals'&nbsp;<br>realization that all kinds of desirable things can substitute for food in lending their&nbsp;<br>likable qualities to the&nbsp;ideas, products, and people artificially linked to them. In the final&nbsp;<br>analysis, then, that is why those good-looking&nbsp;models stand around in the magazine ads.&nbsp;<br>That is why radio programmers are instructed to insert the&nbsp;station's call-letters jingle&nbsp;<br>immediately before a big hit song is played. And that is even why the women playing&nbsp;<br>Barnyard Bingo at a Tupperware party must yell the word&nbsp;<i>Tupper-ware&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>rather than&nbsp;<br><i>Bingo&nbsp;</i>before they can rush to the center of the floor for a prize. It may be Tupperware&nbsp;<br>for the players, but it's&nbsp;<i>Bingo!&nbsp;</i>for the company.&nbsp;<br>
Just because we are often unaware victims of compliance practitioners'&nbsp;use of the&nbsp;<br>association principle doesn't mean that we&nbsp;don't understand how it works or don't use it&nbsp;<br>ourselves. There is ample evidence, for&nbsp;instance, that we understand fully the&nbsp;<br>predicament of a Persian imperial messenger or modern-day weatherman announcing&nbsp;<br>the bad news. In fact, we can be counted on&nbsp;to take steps to avoid putting ourselves in&nbsp;<br>any similar positions. Research done at the University of Georgia shows just how we&nbsp;<br>operate when faced with&nbsp;the task of communicating good or bad news (Rosen &amp; Tesser,&nbsp;<br>1970). Students waiting for an experiment to&nbsp;begin were given the job of informing a&nbsp;<br>fellow student that an important phone call had&nbsp;come in for him.&nbsp;Half&nbsp;the time the call&nbsp;<br>was supposed to bring good news and half&nbsp;the time, bad news. The researchers found&nbsp;<br>that the students conveyed the information&nbsp;very differently depending on its quality.&nbsp;<br>When the news was positive, the tellers were sure to mention that feature: &quot;You just got&nbsp;<br>a phone call with great news. Better see the&nbsp;experimenter for the details.&quot; When the&nbsp;<br>news was unfavorable, they kept themselves apart from&nbsp;it: &quot;You just got a phone call.&nbsp;<br>Better&nbsp;see&nbsp;the experimenter&nbsp;for the&nbsp;details.&quot;&nbsp;Obviously, the students had previously&nbsp;<br>learned that, to be liked, they should connect themselves to good news but not bad&nbsp;<br>news.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>From the News and Weather to the Sports</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
A lot of strange behavior can be explained by&nbsp;the fact that&nbsp;people understand the&nbsp;<br>association principle well enough to try to&nbsp;link themselves to positive events and&nbsp;<br>separate themselves from negative events—even when they have not caused the events.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=179></a><i>Liking&nbsp;</i>169&nbsp;<br>
Some of the strangest of such behavior takes place in the&nbsp;great arena of sports. The&nbsp;<br>actions of the athletes are not the issue, though. After all, in the&nbsp;heated contact of the&nbsp;<br>game, they are entitled to&nbsp;an occasional eccentric outburst.&nbsp;Instead, it is the often raging,&nbsp;<br>irrational, boundless fervor of sports fans that seems, on its face, so puzzling. How can&nbsp;<br>we account for wild sports riots in Europe,&nbsp;or the murder of players and referees by&nbsp;<br>South American soccer crowds gone berserk,&nbsp;or the unnecessary lavish-ness of gifts&nbsp;<br>provided by local fans to already wealthy American ballplayers on the special&nbsp;&quot;day&quot; set&nbsp;<br>aside to honor them?&nbsp;Rationally, none of this makes sense. It's just a game! Isn't it?&nbsp;<br>
Hardly. The relationship between&nbsp;sport and earnest fan is anything but game-like. It is&nbsp;<br>serious, intense, and highly personal. An apt illustration comes from&nbsp;one of my favorite&nbsp;<br>anecdotes. It concerns a World War II soldier who returned to his home in the Balkans&nbsp;<br>after the war and shortly thereafter stopped speaking. Medical&nbsp;examinations could find&nbsp;<br>no physical cause for the problem. There was no wound, no brain damage, no vocal&nbsp;<br>impairment. He could read, write, understand&nbsp;a conversation, and&nbsp;follow orders. Yet he&nbsp;<br>would not talk—not for his doctors, not for his friends, not even for his pleading family.&nbsp;<br>
Perplexed and exasperated, his doctors moved&nbsp;him&nbsp;to another city and placed him&nbsp;in a&nbsp;<br>veterans'&nbsp;hospital where he remained for&nbsp;30 years, never breaking his self-imposed&nbsp;<br>silence and&nbsp;sinking&nbsp;into&nbsp;a life of social isolation. Then&nbsp;one day, a radio in his ward&nbsp;<br>happened to&nbsp;be tuned to&nbsp;a soccer match between his hometown team and a traditional&nbsp;<br>rival. When at a crucial point of play the referee called a foul&nbsp;against a player from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>mute veteran's home&nbsp;team, he jumped&nbsp;from&nbsp;his chair, glared at the radio, and spoke his&nbsp;<br>first words in more than three decades: &quot;You dumb ass!&quot; he cried. &quot;Are you trying to&nbsp;<br><i>give&nbsp;</i>them&nbsp;the match?&quot; With that, he returned to&nbsp;his chair and to a silence he never again&nbsp;<br>violated.&nbsp;<br>
There are two important lessons to be derived from&nbsp;this true story. The first concerns&nbsp;<br>the sheer power of the phenomenon. The veteran's desire to have his hometown team&nbsp;<br>succeed was so strong&nbsp;that it alone produced&nbsp;a deviation from&nbsp;his solidly entrenched&nbsp;<br>way of life. The second lesson&nbsp;reveals much about the nature&nbsp;of the union of sports and&nbsp;<br>sports fans, something crucial to its basic&nbsp;character: It is a personal thing. Whatever&nbsp;<br>fragment of&nbsp;an identity that ravaged,&nbsp;mute man still possessed&nbsp;was engaged by soccer&nbsp;<br>play. No matter how weakened his ego may have become&nbsp;after 30 years of wordless&nbsp;<br>stagnation in a hospital ward, it was involved in the outcome&nbsp;of the match. Why?&nbsp;<br>Because he, personally, would be diminished&nbsp;by a hometown defeat, and he, personally,&nbsp;<br>would be enhanced by a hometown victory.&nbsp;How? Through the principle of association.&nbsp;<br>The mere connection of birthplace hooked&nbsp;him,&nbsp;wrapped him,&nbsp;tied him&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<br>approaching triumph or failure.&nbsp;<br>
This phenomenon helps explain the tragic&nbsp;event that befell tennis superstar Monica&nbsp;<br>Seles in April of 1993. In the midst of a&nbsp;match at the Citizen Cup Tournament in&nbsp;<br>Hamburg, Germany, a spectator lunged out of the stands and buried a boning knife m&nbsp;<br>her back. In one sense, Seles and the tournament security crew had been worried about&nbsp;<br>just such an occurrence. It happened at the time of&nbsp;the brutal&nbsp;civil war in Bosnia&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=180></a>170&nbsp;<i>Chapters</i>&nbsp;<br>
between the Serbs&nbsp;and the Croats when accusations of Serbian atrocities&nbsp;were making&nbsp;<br>worldwide headlines. Seles, Serbian by birth, had been the subject of various death&nbsp;<br>threats and political attacks for months before the incident, causing&nbsp;her to travel&nbsp;<br>frequently&nbsp;under another&nbsp;name, to make multiple&nbsp;plane&nbsp;reservations,&nbsp;and&nbsp;even to wear&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>disguise. When her assailant&nbsp;struck, everyone assumed that&nbsp;his act was connected to the&nbsp;<br>bloody strife in Seles'&nbsp;homeland. But, no;&nbsp;her attacker, an unemployed lathe operator&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;eastern Germany, was not a political&nbsp;or ethnic terrorist. He was a sports&nbsp;<br>
fan. His intent was not to kill Seles but only&nbsp;to injure her so that her rival__and his&nbsp;<br>
countrywoman—Steffi Graf could regain the No. 1 ranking that she&nbsp;had previously lost&nbsp;<br>to Seles. What centuries-old ethnic hatreds and a raging war had not been able to do to&nbsp;<br>Monica Seles, the power&nbsp;of sports accomplished.&nbsp;<br>
As distinguished author Isaac Asimov (1975)&nbsp;put it in describing our reactions to the&nbsp;<br>contests we view, &quot;All things being equal,&nbsp;you root for your own sex, your own culture,&nbsp;<br>your own locality ... and what you want to prove is that&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>are better than the other&nbsp;<br>person. Whomever you root for represents&nbsp;<i>you;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>and when he [or she] wins,&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>win.&quot;&nbsp;<br>When viewed in this light, the passion&nbsp;of a sports fan begins to make sense. The game&nbsp;is&nbsp;<br>no light diversion to be enjoyed for its inherent&nbsp;form&nbsp;and artistry. The self&nbsp;is at stake.&nbsp;<br>That is why hometown crowds are so adoring and,&nbsp;more tellingly,&nbsp;so grateful toward&nbsp;<br>those regularly responsible for home-team&nbsp;victories. That is also why the same crowds&nbsp;<br>are often ferocious in their treatment of players, coaches, and officials implicated&nbsp;in&nbsp;<br>athletic failures.9&nbsp;<br>
So we want our affiliated sports teams to win to prove our own superiority, but to whom&nbsp;<br>are we trying&nbsp;to prove it? Ourselves,&nbsp;certainly, but to everyone else, too. According to&nbsp;<br>the association principle, if we can surround&nbsp;ourselves with success that we are&nbsp;<br>connected&nbsp;with in even&nbsp;a superficial way (for example, place of&nbsp;residence), our public&nbsp;<br>prestige will rise.&nbsp;<br>
All this tells me is that we purposefully&nbsp;manipulate the visibility of our connections&nbsp;<br>with winners and losers in order to make ourselves look good to anyone who views&nbsp;<br>these connections. By showcasing the positive associations and&nbsp;burying the negative&nbsp;<br>ones, we are trying to get observers to think more highly of us&nbsp;and to like us more.&nbsp;<br>There are many ways we go about this, but one&nbsp;of the simplest and most pervasive is in&nbsp;<br>the pronouns we use. Have you noticed for&nbsp;example, how often after a home-team&nbsp;<br>victory fans crowd into the range of&nbsp;a TV&nbsp;camera, thrust their index fingers high, and&nbsp;<br>shout, &quot;We're number one! We're number one!&quot;&nbsp;Note that the call is not &quot;They're&nbsp;<br>number one&quot; or even &quot;Our team&nbsp;is number&nbsp;one.&quot; The pronoun is we, designed to imply&nbsp;<br>the closest possible identity with the team.&nbsp;<br>
9Take, for example, the case of Andres Escobar who, as a member of the Colombian&nbsp;<br>national team, accidentally&nbsp;tipped a ball into&nbsp;his own team's net during a World Cup&nbsp;<br>soccer match in 1994. The &quot;auto-goal&quot; led to&nbsp;a&nbsp;U.S. team&nbsp;victory and&nbsp;to&nbsp;the elimination&nbsp;<br>of&nbsp;the favored Colombians from&nbsp;the competition. Back home two weeks later, Escobar&nbsp;<br>was executed in a restaurant by two gunmen,&nbsp;who shot him&nbsp;12 times for his mistake.&nbsp;<br>

Note also that nothing similar occurs in the case of&nbsp;failure.&nbsp;No television viewer will&nbsp;<br>ever hear the chant, &quot;We're in last place!&nbsp;We're in last place!&quot; Home-team defeats are&nbsp;<br>the times for distancing oneself. Here&nbsp;<i>we&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>is not nearly as preferred&nbsp;as&nbsp;the insulating&nbsp;<br>pronoun&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>they.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>To prove the point, I once&nbsp;did a small experiment&nbsp;in which students&nbsp;at&nbsp;<br>Arizona State University were phoned and asked to describe the outcome&nbsp;of a football&nbsp;<br>game&nbsp;their school team&nbsp;had played a few weeks&nbsp;earlier (Cialdini et al., 1976). Some of&nbsp;<br>the students were asked the outcome&nbsp;of a certain game&nbsp;their team&nbsp;had lost; the other&nbsp;<br>students were asked the outcome&nbsp;of a different game—one their team&nbsp;had won. My&nbsp;<br>fellow researcher, Avril Thorne,&nbsp;and&nbsp;I simply listened to&nbsp;what&nbsp;was said and recorded the&nbsp;<br>percentage of students who used the word&nbsp;<i>we&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>in their descriptions. When the results&nbsp;<br>were tabulated, it was obvious that the students had tried to connect themselves to&nbsp;<br>success by using the pronoun&nbsp;<i>we&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>to describe their school-team&nbsp;victory—&quot;We&nbsp;beat&nbsp;<br>Houston, 17 to 14,&quot; or &quot;We won.&quot; In&nbsp;the case of the lost game, however,&nbsp;<i>we&nbsp;</i>was rarely&nbsp;<br>used. Instead, the students used terms designed&nbsp;to keep&nbsp;themselves separate from&nbsp;their&nbsp;<br>defeated team—&quot;They lost to Missouri,&nbsp;30 to 20,&quot; or &quot;I don't know the score, but&nbsp;<br>Arizona State got beat.&quot; Perhaps the twin desires to connect&nbsp;ourselves to winners and to&nbsp;<br>distance ourselves from&nbsp;losers were combined consummately in the remarks of one&nbsp;<br>particular student. After dryly recounting the score of the home-team&nbsp;defeat—&quot;Arizona&nbsp;<br>State lost it, 30 to 20&quot;—he blurted in anguish,&nbsp;<i>&quot;They&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>threw away&nbsp;<i>our&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>chance for a&nbsp;<br>national championship!&quot;&nbsp;<br>

Although the desire to bask in reflected glory&nbsp;exists to a degree in&nbsp;all of us, there seems&nbsp;<br>to be something special about people who would take this normal tendency too far. Just&nbsp;<br>what kind of people are they?&nbsp;Unless I miss my&nbsp;guess, they are not merely great sports&nbsp;<br>aficionados; they are individuals with hidden personality&nbsp;flaws: poor self-concepts.&nbsp;<br>Deep inside is a sense of low personal worth&nbsp;that&nbsp;directs them&nbsp;to seek prestige not from&nbsp;<br>the generation or promotion of their own&nbsp;attainments but from&nbsp;the generation or&nbsp;<br>promotion of their associations&nbsp;with others'&nbsp;attainments. There are several varieties of&nbsp;<br>this species that bloom&nbsp;throughout our culture.&nbsp;The persistent name-dropper is a classic&nbsp;<br>example. So, too, is the rock-music groupie, who trades sexual favors for the right to tell&nbsp;<br>friends that she or he was &quot;with&quot; a famous musician for a time. No matter which form it&nbsp;<br>takes, the behavior of such individuals shares&nbsp;a similar theme—the rather tragic view of&nbsp;<br>accomplishment as deriving from&nbsp;outside the self.&nbsp;<br>
Certain of these people work the association principle in a slightly different way.&nbsp;<br>Instead of striving to inflate their visible connections to others of success, they strive to&nbsp;<br>inflate the success of&nbsp;others they are visibly connected to. The clearest illustration is the&nbsp;<br>notorious &quot;stage mother,&quot; obsessed with&nbsp;securing stardom for her child. Of course,&nbsp;<br>women are not alone in this&nbsp;regard. In 1991, a Davenport,&nbsp;Iowa, obstetrician cut off&nbsp;<br>service to the wives of three school officials, reportedly because his son had not been&nbsp;<br>given enough playing time in school basketball games. One of the wives was eight&nbsp;<br>months pregnant at the time.&nbsp;<br>

Because I work in&nbsp;the industry, I'm&nbsp;a huge film&nbsp;buff. The biggest night of the year for&nbsp;<br>me&nbsp;is the night of the Academy Awards. I&nbsp;even tape the shows so I can replay the&nbsp;<br>acceptance speeches of the artists I really admire.

But there is&nbsp;one thing about the speech&nbsp;<br>that I never understood before. Here's&nbsp;what&nbsp;he said about winning the best picture&nbsp;<br>award:&nbsp;<br>
&quot;While it may not be as&nbsp;important as the rest&nbsp;of&nbsp;the world situation, it will always be&nbsp;<br>important to us. My family&nbsp;will never forget what happened here; my Native American&nbsp;<br>brothers and sisters, especially the Lakota Sioux, will never forget, and the people I&nbsp;<br>went to high&nbsp;school with&nbsp;will never forget.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
OK, I get why Kevin Costner would never forget this enormous&nbsp;honor. And I also get&nbsp;<br>why his family would never&nbsp;forget it.&nbsp;And I even get why Native Americans would&nbsp;<br>remember it, since the film&nbsp;is about them. But I never understood why he mentioned the&nbsp;<br>people he went to high school&nbsp;with. Then, I read about how&nbsp;sports fans think they can&nbsp;<br>&quot;bask in the reflected glory&quot;&nbsp;of their hometown stars and teams. And, I realized that it's&nbsp;<br>the same&nbsp;thing. Everyone who went to school with Kevin Costner would be telling&nbsp;<br>everyone about their connection the day&nbsp;after he won the Oscar, thinking that&nbsp;<br>

they would get some&nbsp;prestige out of it even&nbsp;though they had zero to do with the film.&nbsp;<br>They would be right, too,&nbsp;because that's how&nbsp;it works. You don't have to be a star to get&nbsp;<br>the glory. Sometimes you only have to be&nbsp;associated with the star somehow. How&nbsp;<br>interesting.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Author's note:&nbsp;</b>I've seen&nbsp;this sort&nbsp;of thing work in my own life when I've&nbsp;told architect&nbsp;<br>friends that I was bom in the same place as the great Frank Lloyd Wright. Please&nbsp;<br>understand, I can't even draw a straight line; but&nbsp;I can see the favorable reaction in my&nbsp;<br>friends' eyes. &quot;Wow,&quot; they seem to say,&nbsp;</i>&quot;You&nbsp;<i>and Frank Lloyd Wright?&quot;</i>&nbsp;<br>
<b>DEFENSE</b>&nbsp;<br>
Because liking can&nbsp;be increased&nbsp;by many means, a list of the defenses against&nbsp;<br>compliance professionals who employ the liking rule must, oddly&nbsp;enough, be a short&nbsp;<br>one. It would be pointless to construct a horde&nbsp;of specific countertactics to combat each&nbsp;<br>of the countless versions of the various ways&nbsp;to influence liking. There are simply too&nbsp;<br>many routes to be blocked effectively with&nbsp;such a one-on-one strategy. Besides, several&nbsp;<br>of the factors leading to liking—physical attractiveness, familiarity,&nbsp;association— have&nbsp;<br>been shown to work unconsciously to produce their effects on us, making it unlikely&nbsp;<br>that we could muster a timely protection against them&nbsp;anyway.&nbsp;<br>
Instead we need to consider a general approach, one that can be applied to any of the&nbsp;<br>liking-related factors to neutralize&nbsp;their unwelcome influence on our compliance&nbsp;<br>decisions. The secret to such an approach may lie in its timing. Rather than trying to&nbsp;<br>recognize and prevent the action of liking factors before they have a chance to work on&nbsp;<br>us, we might be well advised&nbsp;to let them&nbsp;work. Our vigilance should be directed not&nbsp;<br>toward the things that may produce undue&nbsp;liking for a compliance practitioner but&nbsp;<br>toward the fact that undue liking has&nbsp;<i>been produced.&nbsp;</i>The time to call out the defense is&nbsp;<br>when we feel ourselves liking the practitioner more than we should under the&nbsp;<br>circumstances.&nbsp;<br>
By concentrating our attention on the effects&nbsp;rather than the causes, we can avoid the&nbsp;<br>laborious, nearly impossible task&nbsp;of&nbsp;trying to detect and&nbsp;deflect the many psychological&nbsp;<br>influences on liking. Instead, we have to be&nbsp;sensitive to only one&nbsp;thing related to liking&nbsp;<br>in our&nbsp;contacts with compliance practitioners:&nbsp;the feeling&nbsp;that we have come to like&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>practitioner more quickly or more deeply&nbsp;than we would have expected. Once we&nbsp;<i>notice&nbsp;<br></i>this feeling, we will have&nbsp;been tipped off that&nbsp;there is&nbsp;probably some tactic being used,&nbsp;<br>and we can start taking&nbsp;the necessary countermeasures. Note that the strategy I am&nbsp;<br>suggesting borrows much&nbsp;from the jujitsu style favored by the compliance professionals&nbsp;<br>themselves. We don't attempt to restrain the&nbsp;influence of the factors that cause liking.&nbsp;<br>Quite the contrary.&nbsp;We&nbsp;allow those factors to&nbsp;exert their force, and then we use&nbsp;that&nbsp;<br>force in our campaign against those who would profit by them. The&nbsp;stronger the force,&nbsp;<br>the more conspicuous it becomes and, consequently, the more subject to our alerted&nbsp;<br>defenses.&nbsp;<br>

Suppose, for example, we find ourselves bargaining on the price of a new car with&nbsp;<br>Dealin'&nbsp;Dan, a candidate for Joe Girard's vacated &quot;Greatest Car Salesman&quot; title. After&nbsp;<br>talking a while and&nbsp;negotiating a bit,&nbsp;Dan wants&nbsp;to close the deal: he wants us to decide&nbsp;<br>to buy the car. Before any such decision is&nbsp;made, we should ask ourselves the crucial&nbsp;<br>question, &quot;In the 25 minutes I've known this&nbsp;guy, have I come to like him&nbsp;more than I&nbsp;<br>would have expected?&quot; If the answer is yes,&nbsp;we might want to reflect on the ways Dan&nbsp;<br>behaved during those few minutes. We might recall that he&nbsp;has fed us (coffee and&nbsp;<br>doughnuts), complimented us on our choice of&nbsp;options and color combinations, made us&nbsp;<br>laugh, and cooperated with us against the&nbsp;sales manager to get us a better deal.&nbsp;<br>
Although such a review of events might be informative, it is not a necessary step in&nbsp;<br>protecting ourselves from the liking rule. Once we discover that we have come&nbsp;to like&nbsp;<br>Dan more than we would have expected, we don't have to know why. The simple&nbsp;<br>recognition of unwarranted liking should be&nbsp;enough to get us to react against it. One&nbsp;<br>possible reaction would be to&nbsp;reverse the process and actively dislike Dan, but that&nbsp;<br>might be unfair to him&nbsp;and contrary to our own interests. After all,&nbsp;some individuals are&nbsp;<br>naturally likeable, and Dan&nbsp;might&nbsp;just be one of them. It&nbsp;wouldn't be right to turn&nbsp;<br>automatically against those compliance professionals who happen to be most likeable.&nbsp;<br>Besides, for our own sakes, we wouldn't want to shut ourselves off from&nbsp;business&nbsp;<br>interactions with such nice people, especially when they may be offering us the best&nbsp;<br>available deal.&nbsp;<br>
I recommend a different reaction. If our answer to the crucial question is &quot;Yes, under&nbsp;<br>the circumstances, I like this guy peculiarly well,&quot;&nbsp;this should be the signal that the time&nbsp;<br>has come&nbsp;for a quick countermaneuver: Mentally separate Dan from that Chevy or&nbsp;<br>Toyota he's trying to sell. It&nbsp;is vital to remember&nbsp;at this&nbsp;point that, should we choose&nbsp;<br>Dan's car, we will be driving&nbsp;<i>it,&nbsp;</i>not him,&nbsp;off&nbsp;the dealership lot.&nbsp;It is irrelevant to a wise&nbsp;<br>automobile purchase that we find Dan likeable because he&nbsp;is good-looking, claims an&nbsp;<br>interest in our favorite hobby, is funny, or&nbsp;has relatives living where we grew up.&nbsp;<br>
Our proper response, then, is a conscious effort to concentrate exclusively on the merits&nbsp;<br>of the deal and the car Dan has for us. Of&nbsp;course,&nbsp;when we make a compliance decision,&nbsp;<br>it is always a good idea to separate our feelings about the requester from&nbsp;the request.&nbsp;<br>Once immersed in even a brief personal and&nbsp;sociable contact with&nbsp;a requester, however,&nbsp;<br>we may easily forget that distinction. In those instances&nbsp;when we don't care one way or&nbsp;<br>the other about a requester, forgetting to make&nbsp;the distinction won't steer us very far&nbsp;<br>wrong. The big mistakes are likely to come&nbsp;when we like the person making the request.&nbsp;<br>
That's why it is so&nbsp;important&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;alert&nbsp;to a sense of undue&nbsp;liking for a compliance&nbsp;<br>practitioner. The recognition of&nbsp;that feeling can&nbsp;serve as&nbsp;our reminder to separate the&nbsp;<br>dealer from the merits of the deal and to&nbsp;make our decision based on considerations&nbsp;<br>related only to the latter. Were we all to follow this procedure, I am&nbsp;certain we would be&nbsp;<br>much more pleased&nbsp;with&nbsp;the results&nbsp;of our&nbsp;exchanges with&nbsp;compliance professionals—<br>though I suspect that Dealin'&nbsp;Dan would not.&nbsp;<br>

<b>SUMMARY</b>&nbsp;<br>
<i>People prefer to say yes to individuals they know and like.&nbsp;</i>Recognizing this rule,&nbsp;<br>compliance professionals commonly increase their effectiveness by emphasizing several&nbsp;<br>factors that increase their overall attractiveness and likability. One feature of a person&nbsp;<br>that influences overall liking is physical attractiveness. Although it has long been&nbsp;<br>suspected that physical beauty provides an&nbsp;advantage in social&nbsp;interaction, research&nbsp;<br>indicates that the advantage may be greater than supposed. Physical attractiveness&nbsp;<br>seems to engender a halo effect that extends to&nbsp;favorable impressions&nbsp;of other traits such&nbsp;<br>as talent, kindness, and&nbsp;intelligence.&nbsp;As a result,&nbsp;attractive people are more persuasive&nbsp;<br>both in terms of getting what they request and in changing others'&nbsp;attitudes.&nbsp;<br>
A second factor that influences liking and&nbsp;compliance is similarity. We like people who&nbsp;<br>are like us, and we are&nbsp;more willing to say&nbsp;yes&nbsp;to their&nbsp;requests, often&nbsp;in an unthinking&nbsp;<br>manner. Another factor that produces liking is praise. Although they can sometimes&nbsp;<br>backfire when crudely transparent, compliments generally enhance liking and, thus,&nbsp;<br>compliance.&nbsp;<br>
Increased familiarity through repeated contact with a person or thing&nbsp;is yet another&nbsp;<br>factor that&nbsp;normally facilitates liking.&nbsp;This&nbsp;relationship holds true principally when the&nbsp;<br>contact takes place under positive rather&nbsp;than negative circumstances. One positive&nbsp;<br>circumstance that works especially well is&nbsp;mutual and successful cooperation. A fifth&nbsp;<br>factor linked to liking is association. By connecting themselves or their products with&nbsp;<br>positive things, advertisers, politicians, and merchandisers frequently seek to share in&nbsp;<br>the positivity through the process of&nbsp;association. Other individuals as well (sports fans,&nbsp;<br>for example) appear to recognize the effect&nbsp;of simple connections and try to associate&nbsp;<br>themselves with favorable events and distance themselves from&nbsp;unfavorable events&nbsp;in&nbsp;<br>the eyes of observers.&nbsp;<br>
A potentially effective strategy for reducing the unwanted influence of liking on&nbsp;<br>compliance decisions requires a special sensitivity to the experience of undue liking for&nbsp;<br>a requester. Upon recognizing that we like&nbsp;a requester inordinately well under the&nbsp;<br>circumstances, we should step back from&nbsp;the social interaction, mentally separate the&nbsp;<br>requester from&nbsp;his or her offer, and make&nbsp;any compliance decision&nbsp;based solely on the&nbsp;<br>merits of the offer.&nbsp;<br>
<b>STUDY QUESTIONS_____________________________________</b>&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Content Mastery</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
1. To what does the term&nbsp;<i>halo effect&nbsp;</i>refer?&nbsp;How can it&nbsp;help&nbsp;explain the relationship&nbsp;<br>between a person's physical attractiveness and&nbsp;that person's general&nbsp;attractiveness in the&nbsp;<br>eyes of others?&nbsp;<br>

2. We&nbsp;tend to like people who say they like us&nbsp;(that is, who give us compliments). We&nbsp;<br>also tend to like people who say they&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>like&nbsp;us&nbsp;(that is, similar to&nbsp;us).&nbsp;In&nbsp;the&nbsp;latter case,&nbsp;<br>what is the evidence that we tend to say yes&nbsp;to similar others in an automatic fashion?&nbsp;<br>
3. A series of studies on the creation and reduction of hostility between groups was&nbsp;<br>conducted at boys'&nbsp;summer camps. After hostility was generated, which procedures&nbsp;<br>successfully&nbsp;reduced the&nbsp;hostility? Which were unsuccessful?&nbsp;<br>
4. To what does the tendency to bask in reflected glory refer?&nbsp;Under which conditions&nbsp;<br>and for which kind of person is this&nbsp;tendency most likely to appear?&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Critical&nbsp;Thinking</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>1.&nbsp;</i>In a letter to her sister,&nbsp;Jane Austen&nbsp;wrote,&nbsp;&quot;I do not want people to be very agreeable,&nbsp;<br>as it saves me&nbsp;the trouble of liking them&nbsp;a great deal.&quot; To which trouble associated with&nbsp;<br>liking people could she have been referring?&nbsp;<br>
2. Will Rogers, who boasted, &quot;I never met a man I didn't like,&quot;&nbsp;obviously felt differently&nbsp;<br>than Austen about the advantages of liking&nbsp;others. What would be the consequences of&nbsp;<br>Rogers's more expansive approach to interpersonal relations?&nbsp;Think about your own&nbsp;<br>interpersonal style. Is it closer&nbsp;to Rogers's or Austen's?&nbsp;Why?&nbsp;<br>
3. What parallels can you see between the findings of the boys'&nbsp;camp studies and those&nbsp;<br>of studies on the effects of (a) school desegregation and (b) cooperative learning in the&nbsp;<br>classroom?&nbsp;<br>
4. Suppose you wanted the person&nbsp;sitting next to you in class to like you more. Using&nbsp;<br>the factors discussed in this chapter,&nbsp;describe how you would arrange your next&nbsp;<br>encounter to&nbsp;accomplish your goal.&nbsp;<br>

<hr>
<a name=189></a>Suppose while leafing through your local newspaper, you notice an ad for volunteers to&nbsp;<br>take part in a &quot;study of memory&quot; being done&nbsp;in the psychology department of a nearby&nbsp;<br>university. Suppose further that, finding the idea&nbsp;of such an experiment intriguing, you&nbsp;<br>contact the director of the study, Professor&nbsp;Stanley Mil-gram, and make arrangements to&nbsp;<br>participate in an hour-long session. When you&nbsp;arrive at the laboratory suite, you meet&nbsp;<br>two men. One is the researcher in charge of the experiment, clearly evidenced by the&nbsp;<br>grey lab coat he wears and the clipboard&nbsp;he carries. The other is a volunteer like&nbsp;<br>yourself who seems quite average in all respects.&nbsp;<br>
After initial greetings and pleasantries are exchanged, the researcher begins to explain&nbsp;<br>the procedures to be followed. He says that the experiment is a study of how&nbsp;<br>punishment affects learning and memory. Therefore, one participant will have the task&nbsp;<br>of learning pairs of words in&nbsp;a long&nbsp;list until each pair can be recalled perfectly; this&nbsp;<br>person is to be called the&nbsp;Learner. The other participant's job will be to test the Learner's&nbsp;<br>memory and to deliver increasingly strong electric shocks for every mistake; this person&nbsp;<br>will be designated the Teacher.&nbsp;<br>
Naturally, you get a bit nervous at this news. Your apprehension increases when, after&nbsp;<br>drawing lots with your partner, you find that you are assigned the Learner role. You&nbsp;<br>hadn't expected the possibility&nbsp;of pain as part of the&nbsp;study, so you briefly consider&nbsp;<br>leaving. But no, you think, there's plenty of time for that if need be and, besides how&nbsp;<br>strong a shock could it be?&nbsp;<br>
After you have had a chance to study the list of&nbsp;word pairs, the researcher straps you&nbsp;<br>into a chair and, with&nbsp;the Teacher looking on,&nbsp;attaches electrodes to&nbsp;your arm. More&nbsp;<br>worried now&nbsp;about the effect of the shock, you&nbsp;inquire into its severity. The researcher's&nbsp;<br>response is hardly comforting. He says that although the shocks can be extremely&nbsp;<br>painful, they will cause you &quot;no permanent&nbsp;tissue damage.&quot; With that, the researcher&nbsp;<br>and Teacher leave you alone and go to the next room where the Teacher asks you the&nbsp;<br>test questions through an intercom&nbsp;system&nbsp;and delivers electric punishment for every&nbsp;<br>wrong response.&nbsp;<br>
As the test proceeds, you quickly recognize&nbsp;the pattern that the Teacher follows: He&nbsp;<br>asks the question and waits for your answer&nbsp;over the intercom. Whenever you err, he&nbsp;<br>announces the voltage of the shock you are about&nbsp;to receive and pulls a lever to deliver&nbsp;<br>the punishment. The most troubling thing is&nbsp;that, with each error you make, the shock&nbsp;<br>increases by 15 volts.&nbsp;<br>
The first part of the test progresses smoothly. The shocks are annoying but tolerable.&nbsp;<br>Later on, though, as you make more mistakes and the shock voltages climb, the&nbsp;<br>punishment begins to hurt enough to disrupt&nbsp;your concentration, which leads to more&nbsp;<br>errors and ever more disruptive shocks. At&nbsp;the 75-, 90-, and 105-volt levels, the Pain&nbsp;<br>makes you grunt audibly. At 120 volts, you exclaim&nbsp;into the intercom&nbsp;that the shocks&nbsp;<br>are&nbsp;<i>really&nbsp;</i>starting to hurt. You take one more punishment with a groan and decide that&nbsp;<br>you can't&nbsp;take&nbsp;much more pain. After the Teacher delivers the 150-volt&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

shock, you shout back into the intercom&nbsp;&quot;That's all. Get me out of here. Get me out of&nbsp;<br>here, please. Let me&nbsp;out.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Instead of the assurance you expect from&nbsp;the Teacher, that he and the researcher are&nbsp;<br>coming to release you, he merely gives you the next test question&nbsp;to answer. Surprised&nbsp;<br>and confused you mumble the first answer to&nbsp;come into your head. It's wrong, of course,&nbsp;<br>and the Teacher delivers a 165-volt shock. You scream&nbsp;at the Teacher to&nbsp;stop, to let you&nbsp;<br>out. He responds only with the next test&nbsp;question—and with the next slashing shock,&nbsp;<br>when your frenzied answer is incorrect. You can't hold down the panic any longer, the&nbsp;<br>shocks are so strong now they make you writhe and shriek. You kick the wall, demand&nbsp;<br>to be released, and beg the Teacher to help&nbsp;you.&nbsp;However, the test questions continue as&nbsp;<br>before and so do the dreaded shocks—in searing jolts of 195, 210, 225, 240, 255, 270,&nbsp;<br>285, and 300 volts. You realize that you can't&nbsp;possibly answer the questions correctly&nbsp;<br>now, so you shout to the Teacher that you won't answer his questions anymore. Nothing&nbsp;<br>changes; the Teacher interprets your failure to&nbsp;respond as an incorrect response and&nbsp;<br>sends another bolt. The&nbsp;ordeal continues in this way until, finally, the&nbsp;power of the&nbsp;<br>shocks stuns you into near-paralysis. You can&nbsp;no longer cry out, no longer struggle. You&nbsp;<br>can only feel each&nbsp;terrible electric bite. Perhaps, you think,&nbsp;this total inactivity will&nbsp;<br>cause the Teacher to stop. There can be no reason to continue this experiment, but he&nbsp;<br>proceeds&nbsp;relentlessly,&nbsp;calling&nbsp;out the test&nbsp;questions, announcing the horrid shock levels&nbsp;<br>(above 400 volts now), and pulling the levers.&nbsp;What must this man be like, you wonder&nbsp;<br>in confusion. Why doesn't&nbsp;he help me?&nbsp;Why won't&nbsp;he stop?&nbsp;<br>
<b>THE POWER OF AUTHORITY PRESSURE</b>&nbsp;<br>
For most of us, the previous scenario&nbsp;reads like a bad dream. To recognize how&nbsp;<br>nightmarish it is, though, we should understand that, in most respects, it is real. There&nbsp;<br>was such an experiment—actually, a whole series—run by a psychology professor&nbsp;<br>named Milgram&nbsp;(1974) in which participants in&nbsp;the Teacher role were willing to deliver&nbsp;<br>continued, intense, and dangerous levels&nbsp;of shock to a kicking, screeching, pleading&nbsp;<br>Learner. Only one major aspect of the experiment was not genuine. No real shock was&nbsp;<br>delivered; the Learner, who repeatedly cried out in agony for mercy and release, was not&nbsp;<br>a true&nbsp;subject but an actor&nbsp;who only pretended to be shocked. The actual purpose of&nbsp;<br>Milgram's study, then, had nothing to do with&nbsp;the effects of punishment on learning&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br>memory. Rather, it involved an entirely different question: When it is their job, how&nbsp;<br>much suffering will ordinary people be willing to inflict on an entirely innocent other&nbsp;<br>person?&nbsp;<br>
The answer is most unsettling. Under circumstances mirroring precisely the features of&nbsp;<br>the &quot;bad dream,&quot; the typical Teacher was willing to deliver as much pain as was&nbsp;<br>available to give. Rather than yield to the&nbsp;pleas of the victim, about two-thirds of the&nbsp;<br>subjects in&nbsp;Milgram's experiment pulled every one of the 30 shock switches in front of&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;and continued to engage the last switch (450&nbsp;volts) until the re-&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

searcher ended the experiment. More alarming&nbsp;still, almost none of the 40 subjects in&nbsp;<br>this study quit his job as Teacher when the victim first began to demand his release, nor&nbsp;<br>later when he began to&nbsp;beg for it, nor even&nbsp;later when his&nbsp;reaction to each shock had&nbsp;<br>become, in Milgram's words, &quot;definitely an agonized scream.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
These results surprised everyone associated&nbsp;with the project, Milgram&nbsp;included. In fact,&nbsp;<br>before the study began, he asked groups of&nbsp;colleagues, graduate students, and&nbsp;<br>psychology majors at Yale University (where&nbsp;the experiment was performed) to read a&nbsp;<br>copy of the experimental procedures and&nbsp;estimate how many subjects would go all the&nbsp;<br>way to the last (450-volt) shock. Invariably,&nbsp;the answers fell in the 1-2 percent range. A&nbsp;<br>separate group of 39 psychiatrists predicted that only about one person in a thousand&nbsp;<br>would be willing to continue&nbsp;to the end. No one, then, was prepared for the behavior&nbsp;<br>pattern that the experiment actually produced.&nbsp;<br>
How can we explain that alarming pattern? Perhaps, as some&nbsp;have argued, it has to do&nbsp;<br>with the fact that the subjects were&nbsp;all males who are known as a group for&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=192></a>182&nbsp;<i>Chapter 6&nbsp;</i><br>
their aggressive tendencies, or that the subjects didn't recognize the potential harm&nbsp;that&nbsp;<br>such high shock voltages could&nbsp;cause, or that the subjects&nbsp;were a freakish&nbsp;collection&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>moral cretins who enjoyed the chance to inflict misery. There is good evidence against&nbsp;<br>each of these possibilities. First, a later experiment showed that the subjects'&nbsp;sex was&nbsp;<br>irrelevant&nbsp;to&nbsp;their willingness to&nbsp;give all the shocks to&nbsp;the&nbsp;victim; female Teachers were&nbsp;<br>just as likely&nbsp;to do so as were the males in Milgram's initial study.&nbsp;<br>
Another experiment investigated&nbsp;the explanation that subjects weren't aware of the&nbsp;<br>potential physical danger to the victim. In this experiment the victim&nbsp;was instructed&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>announce that he had a heart condition and to&nbsp;declare that his heart was being affected&nbsp;<br>by the shock: &quot;That's all. Get me&nbsp;out of here. I told you I had heart trouble. My heart's&nbsp;<br>starting to bother me. I refuse to go on. Let me&nbsp;out.&quot; Once again the results were the&nbsp;<br>same; 65 percent of the subjects carried&nbsp;out their duties faithfully through to the&nbsp;<br>maximum shock.&nbsp;<br>
Finally, the explanation that&nbsp;Milgram's subjects were a twisted, sadistic bunch not at all&nbsp;<br>representative of average&nbsp;citizens has proven unsatisfactory as well. The people who&nbsp;<br>answered Milgram's newspaper ad to participate in his &quot;memory&quot; experiment&nbsp;<br>represented&nbsp;a standard&nbsp;cross section of ages, occupations, and educational levels within&nbsp;<br>our society. What's more, later on, a battery of&nbsp;personality scales showed these people to&nbsp;<br>be quite normal psychologically, with not a hint of psychosis as a group. They were, in&nbsp;<br>fact, just like you and me; or, as Milgram&nbsp;likes to term&nbsp;it, they&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>you and me. If he&nbsp;is&nbsp;<br>right that his studies implicate us in their grisly findings, the unanswered question&nbsp;<br>becomes an uncomfortably personal one, &quot;What could make&nbsp;<i>us&nbsp;</i>do such things?&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Milgram&nbsp;is sure he knows the answer. It has&nbsp;to do, he says, with a&nbsp;deep-seated sense of&nbsp;<br>duty to authority. According to Milgram, the real culprit in the experiments was his&nbsp;<br>subjects'&nbsp;inability to defy&nbsp;the wishes of&nbsp;the boss, the lab-coated researcher who urged&nbsp;<br>and, if necessary, directed the subjects to perform their duties, despite the emotional and&nbsp;<br>physical mayhem&nbsp;they were causing.&nbsp;<br>
The evidence supporting Milgram's obedience-to-authority explanation is strong. First,&nbsp;<br>it is clear that, without the researcher's directives to continue, the subjects would have&nbsp;<br>ended the experiment quickly. They hated what they were doing and agonized over their&nbsp;<br>victim's&nbsp;anguish. They implored the researcher&nbsp;to let them&nbsp;stop. When he refused, they&nbsp;<br>went on, but in the process they trembled, they perspired, they shook, they stammered&nbsp;<br>protests and additional pleas&nbsp;for the victim's&nbsp;release. Their fingernails&nbsp;dug into their&nbsp;<br>own flesh; they bit their&nbsp;lips until they bled;&nbsp;they&nbsp;held their heads in their hands; some&nbsp;<br>fell into fits of uncontrollable&nbsp;nervous laughter. An outside&nbsp;observer to Milgram's initial&nbsp;<br>experiment described one subject.&nbsp;<br>

(Milgram, 1963, p.&nbsp;<br>377)</i>&nbsp;<br>
In addition to these observations, Milgram&nbsp;has provided even more convincing evidence&nbsp;<br>for the obedience-to-authority interpretation of his subjects'&nbsp;behavior. In a later&nbsp;<br>experiment, for instance, he had the researcher and the victim switch scripts so that the&nbsp;<br>researcher&nbsp;told the Teacher to stop&nbsp;delivering shocks to the victim, while&nbsp;the&nbsp;victim&nbsp;<br>insisted bravely that the Teacher continue.&nbsp;The result couldn't have been clearer; 100&nbsp;<br>percent of&nbsp;the subjects refused to give one additional shock when it was merely the&nbsp;<br>fellow subject who demanded it. The identical&nbsp;finding appeared in another version of&nbsp;<br>the experiment in which&nbsp;the researcher and&nbsp;fellow subject switched roles so that it was&nbsp;<br>the researcher who was strapped&nbsp;into the chair and the fellow subject who ordered the&nbsp;<br>Teacher to continue—over the protests of the researcher. Again, not one subject touched&nbsp;<br>another shock lever.&nbsp;<br>
The extreme degree to&nbsp;which subjects in&nbsp;Milgram's studies obeyed the orders of&nbsp;<br>authority was documented in yet another variation of the basic experiments. In this case,&nbsp;<br>the Teacher faced two researchers who issued contradictory orders; one ordered the&nbsp;<br>Teacher to terminate the shocks when the victim cried out for release, while the other&nbsp;<br>maintained that the experiment should go&nbsp;on. These conflicting instructions reliably&nbsp;<br>produced what may have been the project's&nbsp;only humor: In tragicomic be-fuddlement&nbsp;<br>and with eyes darting from&nbsp;one researcher to&nbsp;another, subjects would beseech the pair to&nbsp;<br>agree on a single command to follow, &quot;Wait, wait. Which is it going to be?&nbsp;One says&nbsp;<br>stop, one says go.... Which is it!?&quot; When the&nbsp;researchers remained at loggerheads, the&nbsp;<br>subjects tried frantically&nbsp;to determine who&nbsp;was&nbsp;the&nbsp;bigger boss. Failing this&nbsp;route&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>obedience with&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>authority, every subject finally&nbsp;followed his better instincts and&nbsp;<br>ended the shocks. As in the other experimental&nbsp;variations, such a result would hardly be&nbsp;<br>expected had the subjects'&nbsp;motivations involved some form&nbsp;of sadism&nbsp;or neurotic&nbsp;<br>aggressiveness.1&nbsp;<br>
To Milgram's mind, evidence of a chilling phenomenon emerges repeatedly from&nbsp;his&nbsp;<br>accumulated data. &quot;It is the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost&nbsp;any lengths&nbsp;on&nbsp;<br>the command of&nbsp;an authority that constitutes&nbsp;the&nbsp;chief&nbsp;finding&nbsp;of&nbsp;the study&quot; (Milgram,&nbsp;<br>1974). There are sobering implications of this finding for those&nbsp;concerned about the&nbsp;<br>ability of another form&nbsp;of authority—government—to extract frightening&nbsp;<br>
The basic experiment, as well as all these and other variations on it, is presented in&nbsp;<br>Milgram's highly readable&nbsp;<i>Obedience to Authority,&nbsp;</i>1974. A review of much of the&nbsp;<br>subsequent research on obedience can be&nbsp;found in Blass (1991,&nbsp;1999) and in Miller,&nbsp;<br>Collins, &amp; Brief (1995).&nbsp;<br>

levels of obedience from&nbsp;ordinary citizens.2&nbsp;Furthermore, the finding tells us something&nbsp;<br>about the sheer strength of authority pressures in controlling&nbsp;our behavior. After&nbsp;<br>witnessing Milgram's subjects squirming and&nbsp;sweating and suffering at their task, could&nbsp;<br>anyone doubt the power of the force that held them there?&nbsp;<br>
For those whose doubts&nbsp;remain, the story of S. Brian Willson might prove instructive.&nbsp;<br>On September 1, 1987, to protest U.S. shipments of military&nbsp;equipment to Nicaragua,&nbsp;<br>Mr. Willson&nbsp;and two other men stretched their bodies across&nbsp;the railroad&nbsp;tracks leading&nbsp;<br>out of the Naval Weapons Station in Concord,&nbsp;California. The protesters were confident&nbsp;<br>that their act would halt the scheduled train's progress that day, as they had notified&nbsp;<br>navy and railroad officials of&nbsp;their intent three days before. But the civilian crew, which&nbsp;<br>had been given orders not to stop, never even&nbsp;slowed the train, despite being able to see&nbsp;<br>the protesters 600 feet ahead. Although two of the men managed to scramble out of&nbsp;<br>harm's way, Mr. Willson&nbsp;was not quick enough&nbsp;to avoid being struck and having both&nbsp;<br>legs severed&nbsp;below the knee. Because navy medical corpsmen at the scene refused to&nbsp;<br>treat him&nbsp;or allow him to be taken to&nbsp;the hospital in their ambulance, onlookers—<br>including Mr. Willson's wife and son—were left&nbsp;to try to staunch the flow&nbsp;of blood for&nbsp;<br>45 minutes until a private ambulance arrived.&nbsp;<br>
Amazingly, Mr. Willson, who served four years&nbsp;in Vietnam, does not blame either the&nbsp;<br>crewmen or the corpsmen for his misfortune;&nbsp;he points his finger,&nbsp;instead, at a system&nbsp;<br>that constrained their actions&nbsp;through the pressure&nbsp;to obey. &quot;They were just doing what I&nbsp;<br>did in 'Nam. They were following orders that are part of an insane policy. They're the&nbsp;<br>fall guys.&quot; Although the crew members shared&nbsp;Mr. Willson's assessment of them&nbsp;as&nbsp;<br>victims, they did not share his magnanimity. In what is perhaps the most remarkable&nbsp;<br>aspect of the incident, the&nbsp;train&nbsp;crew filed suit against&nbsp;<i>him,&nbsp;</i>requesting&nbsp;punitive damages&nbsp;<br>for the &quot;humiliation, mental anguish, and physical stress&quot; they suffered because he&nbsp;<br>hadn't allowed them&nbsp;to carry out their&nbsp;orders without cutting off his legs.&nbsp;<br>
2In fact, Milgram&nbsp;first began his investigations in an attempt to understand how&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>German citizenry could&nbsp;have participated in the concentration camp&nbsp;destruction&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>millions of innocents&nbsp;during the years&nbsp;of&nbsp;Nazi ascendancy. After testing&nbsp;his&nbsp;<br>experimental procedures in the United States,&nbsp;he had planned to take them to Germany,&nbsp;<br>a country whose populace he was sure would provide enough obedience for a full-flown&nbsp;<br>scientific analysis&nbsp;of&nbsp;the concept.&nbsp;The&nbsp;first eye-opening experiment in New Haven,&nbsp;<br>Connecticut, however, make it clear that he&nbsp;could save his money and stay close to&nbsp;<br>home. &quot;I found so much obedience,&quot; he said, &quot;I hardly saw the&nbsp;need of taking the&nbsp;<br>experiment to Germany.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
More telling evidence,&nbsp;perhaps, of&nbsp;a willingness to submit to authorized command&nbsp;<br>within the American character comes from&nbsp;a national survey taken&nbsp;after the trial of&nbsp;<br>Lieutenant&nbsp;William&nbsp;Galley, who ordered his&nbsp;soldiers to kill the inhabitants—infants and&nbsp;<br>toddlers as well as their parents and grandparents—of My Lai, Vietnam&nbsp;(Kelman &amp;&nbsp;<br>Hamilton, 1989). A majority of Americans (51&nbsp;percent) responded that if so ordered,&nbsp;<br>they too would shoot all the residents of a Vietnamese village. But Americans have no&nbsp;<br>monopoly on the need to obey authority.&nbsp;When Milgram's basic procedure was&nbsp;<br>eventually repeated in Holland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Australia, and Jordan, the results&nbsp;<br>were similar (see Meeus &amp; Raaijmakers, 1986, for a review).&nbsp;<br>

<b>THE ALLURES AND DANGERS OF BLIND OBEDIENCE</b>&nbsp;<br>
Whenever we are faced with a potent motivator&nbsp;of human action, it is natural to expect&nbsp;<br>that good reasons exist for the motivation. In&nbsp;the case of obedience to authority, even a&nbsp;<br>brief consideration of human social organization offers justification aplenty.&nbsp;A&nbsp;<br>multilayered&nbsp;and widely&nbsp;accepted system&nbsp;of&nbsp;authority confers an immense advantage&nbsp;<br>upon a society. It allows the development of sophisticated structures for production of&nbsp;<br>resources, trade, defense, expansion, and&nbsp;social control that would otherwise be&nbsp;<br>impossible. At the opposite end, the alternative is anarchy, a state hardly known for its&nbsp;<br>beneficial effects on cultural groups and one&nbsp;that the social philosopher Thomas Hobbes&nbsp;<br>assures us would render life &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish,&nbsp;and short.&quot; Consequently, we&nbsp;<br>are trained from&nbsp;birth to believe that obedience to&nbsp;proper authority is right and&nbsp;<br>disobedience is wrong. This message fills the parental lessons, the schoolhouse rhymes,&nbsp;<br>stories, and&nbsp;songs of our childhood&nbsp;and is&nbsp;carried forward&nbsp;in the legal, military, and&nbsp;<br>political systems we encounter as adults. Notions of submission and loyalty to&nbsp;<br>legitimate rule are accorded much value in each.&nbsp;<br>
Religious instruction contributes as well. The very first&nbsp;book of the Bible, for example,&nbsp;<br>describes how failure to obey the ultimate authority resulted in the loss of&nbsp;paradise for&nbsp;<br>Adam, Eve, and the rest of the human race.&nbsp;Should that particular metaphor prove too&nbsp;<br>subtle, just a bit further&nbsp;into the Old Testament, we can read—in what might be the&nbsp;<br>closest biblical representation of the Milgram&nbsp;experiment—the respectful account of&nbsp;<br>Abraham's&nbsp;willingness to plunge a dagger through the heart of his young son because&nbsp;<br>God, without any explanation, ordered it. We&nbsp;learn in this story that&nbsp;the correctness of&nbsp;<br>an action was not judged by such considerations&nbsp;as apparent senselessness, harmfulness,&nbsp;<br>injustice, or&nbsp;usual moral standards, but by the mere command of a higher authority.&nbsp;<br>Abraham's tormented ordeal was a test of obedience, and he—like Milgram's subjects,&nbsp;<br>who perhaps had learned an early lesson from&nbsp;him—passed.&nbsp;<br>
Stories like those of Abraham&nbsp;and Milgram's&nbsp;subjects can tell us a great deal about&nbsp;<br>obedience's power and value in&nbsp;our culture. In another sense, however, the stories may&nbsp;<br>be misleading. We&nbsp;rarely agonize to such a&nbsp;degree over the pros and cons of authority&nbsp;<br>demands. In fact, our obedience frequently takes place in a&nbsp;<i>click, whirr&nbsp;</i>fashion with&nbsp;<br>little or no conscious deliberation. Information from&nbsp;a recognized authority can provide&nbsp;<br>us a valuable shortcut for deciding how to act in a situation.&nbsp;<br>
After all, as Milgram&nbsp;suggests, conforming&nbsp;to the dictates of authority figures has&nbsp;<br>always had genuine practical advantages&nbsp;for us. Early on, these people (parents,&nbsp;<br>teachers) knew more than we did, and&nbsp;we found that taking their advice proved&nbsp;<br>beneficial—partly because of their greater wisdom&nbsp;and partly because they controlled&nbsp;<br>our rewards and punishments. As adults, the same benefits persist for the same reasons,&nbsp;<br>though the authority figures are now employers, judges, and government leaders.&nbsp;<br>Because their positions speak of greater access to&nbsp;information and power, it makes sense&nbsp;<br>to comply with the wishes of properly constituted authorities. It makes so much sense,&nbsp;<br>in fact, that we often do so&nbsp;when it makes no sense at all.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=196></a>186&nbsp;<i>Chapter 6</i>&nbsp;<br>
This paradox is, of course, the same&nbsp;one that attends all major weapons of influence. In&nbsp;<br>this instance, once we&nbsp;realize that obedience&nbsp;to authority is mostly rewarding, it is easy&nbsp;<br>to allow ourselves the convenience of automatic obedience. The simultaneous blessing&nbsp;<br>and curse of such blind obedience is&nbsp;its mechanical character. We&nbsp;don't&nbsp;have to think,&nbsp;<br>therefore we&nbsp;don't. Although such mindless obedience leads us to appropriate action&nbsp;<br>most of the time, there will be conspicuous exceptions because we are reacting, not&nbsp;<br>thinking.&nbsp;<br>
Let's take an example from&nbsp;one facet of&nbsp;our lives in which authority pressures are&nbsp;<br>visible and strong: medicine.&nbsp;Health is enormously important to us. Thus, physicians,&nbsp;<br>who possess great knowledge and influence in&nbsp;this vital area, hold the position of&nbsp;<br>respected authorities. In addition, the medical establishment has a clearly terraced&nbsp;<br>power and prestige structure. The various&nbsp;kinds of health workers well understand the&nbsp;<br>level of their jobs in this&nbsp;structure, and they well understand, too, that M.D.s sit at the&nbsp;<br>top. No one may overrule a doctor's judgment in&nbsp;a case, except, perhaps, another doctor&nbsp;<br>of higher rank. Consequently,&nbsp;a long-established tradition&nbsp;of automatic obedience to&nbsp;<br>doctors'&nbsp;orders has developed among health care staffs.&nbsp;<br>
The worrisome&nbsp;possibility arises, then, that&nbsp;when a physician makes a clear error, no&nbsp;<br>one lower in&nbsp;the hierarchy will&nbsp;<i>think&nbsp;</i>to question&nbsp;it—precisely because, once a legitimate&nbsp;<br>authority has given an order, subordinates stop&nbsp;<i>thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>in the situation and start&nbsp;<br>reacting. Mix this kind of&nbsp;<i>click, whirr&nbsp;</i>response into a complex hospital environment and&nbsp;<br>mistakes are inevitable. Indeed, a study by the U.S. Health Care Financing&nbsp;<br>Administration shows that, for patient medication alone, the average hospital has a 12&nbsp;<br>percent daily error rate.&nbsp;<br>
Errors in the medicine patients receive can&nbsp;occur for a variety of reasons. However, in&nbsp;<br>their book&nbsp;<i>Medication&nbsp;Errors: Causes and Prevention&nbsp;</i>(1981), Temple University&nbsp;<br>professors of pharmacy Michael Cohen and Neil&nbsp;Davis attribute much of the problem to&nbsp;<br>the mindless deference given to the &quot;boss&quot; of&nbsp;a patient's case: the attending physician.&nbsp;<br>According to Cohen, &quot;in case after case,&nbsp;patients, nurses, pharmacists, and other&nbsp;<br>physicians do not question the prescription.&quot;&nbsp;Take, for example, the strange case of the&nbsp;<br>&quot;rectal earache&quot; reported by Cohen and Davis. A physician ordered ear drops to be&nbsp;<br>administered to the right ear of a patient&nbsp;suffering pain and infection there. Instead of&nbsp;<br>writing out completely the location &quot;Right ear&quot; on the prescription, the doctor&nbsp;<br>abbreviated&nbsp;it so that the instructions read &quot;place in R&nbsp;ear.&quot; Upon&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>prescription, the duty nurse promptly put&nbsp;the required number of ear drops into the&nbsp;<br>patient's anus.&nbsp;<br>
Obviously, rectal treatment of an earache made&nbsp;no sense, but neither the patient nor the&nbsp;<br>nurse questioned it. The important lesson of this story is&nbsp;that&nbsp;in&nbsp;many situations in&nbsp;<br>which a legitimate authority has spoken, what&nbsp;would otherwise make&nbsp;sense is irrelevant.&nbsp;<br>In these instances, we don't consider the situation as a whole but&nbsp;attend and respond to&nbsp;<br>only one aspect of it.&nbsp;<br>
We are not the only species to give sometimes single-minded deference to those in&nbsp;<br>authority positions. In&nbsp;monkey colonies, where rigid dominance hierarchies exist,&nbsp;<br>beneficial innovations (for example, learning how to use a stick to bring food into&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
the cage area) do not spread quickly through&nbsp;the group unless they are taught first to a&nbsp;<br>dominant animal. When a lower animal is taught the new concept first, the rest of the&nbsp;<br>colony remains mostly oblivious to its value. One study, cited by Ardry (1970), on the&nbsp;<br>introduction of new food tastes to Japanese&nbsp;monkeys provides a nice illustration. In one&nbsp;<br>troop, a taste for caramels was developed by introducing this new food&nbsp;into the diet of&nbsp;<br>young peripherals, low on the status ladder. The taste for caramels inched slowly up the&nbsp;<br>ranks: A year and a half later, only 51 percent of the colony&nbsp;had&nbsp;acquired it, but still&nbsp;<br>none of the leaders. Contrast this with what happened in a second troop where wheat&nbsp;<br>was introduced first to the leader: Wheat eating—to this point unknown to these&nbsp;<br>monkeys—spread through the whole colony within four hours. Very much the same&nbsp;<br>thing happened in 1995 on the Chicago Bulls&nbsp;basketball team&nbsp;when the acknowledged&nbsp;<br>leader and star, Michael Jordan, began eating three Energy&nbsp;Booster bars before each&nbsp;<br>game. According to substitute player Steve Kerr, &quot;B. J. Armstrong [another non-star&nbsp;<br>player] and&nbsp;I were the only ones&nbsp;eating them&nbsp;before. Then Michael eats some, and now&nbsp;<br>everybody's eating them&quot; (Shappell, 1995).&nbsp;<br>

Wherever our behaviors are governed in&nbsp;such an unthinking manner, we can be&nbsp;<br>confident that there will be&nbsp;compliance professionals&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;take advantage.&nbsp;<br>Returning to the field of medicine, we can&nbsp;see that advertisers have frequently&nbsp;<br>commissioned the respect accorded doctors in&nbsp;our culture by hiring actors to play the&nbsp;<br>roles of doctors speaking on&nbsp;behalf&nbsp;of the product. My&nbsp;favorite example was a TV&nbsp;<br>commercial featuring the actor Robert Young warning people against the dangers of&nbsp;<br>caffeine and recommending caffeine-free Sanka brand coffee. The commercial was&nbsp;<br>highly successful, selling so much Sanka that it&nbsp;was played for years&nbsp;in several versions.&nbsp;<br>Why should this commercial prove so effective?&nbsp;Why on earth would we take Robert&nbsp;<br>Young's word for the health&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;of decaffeinated&nbsp;coffee? Because— as the&nbsp;<br>advertising agency that hired him&nbsp;knew perfectly well—he was associated in the minds&nbsp;<br>of the American public with Marcus Welby, M.D., the role he&nbsp;played in an&nbsp;earlier long-<br>running television series. Objectively, it doesn't&nbsp;make sense to be swayed by the&nbsp;<br>comments of a man we&nbsp;know to be just an&nbsp;actor who used to play a doctor; but,&nbsp;<br>practically, that man sold the Sanka.&nbsp;<br>
<b>CONNOTATION NOT&nbsp;CONTENT</b>&nbsp;<br>
From&nbsp;the first time I saw&nbsp;it, I found the most&nbsp;intriguing feature of&nbsp;Robert Young's&nbsp;Sanka&nbsp;<br>commercial to be its ability to use the influence of the authority principle without ever&nbsp;<br>providing a real authority.&nbsp;The appearance of authority&nbsp;was enough. This tells us&nbsp;<br>something important about unthinking reactions to authority figures. When in a&nbsp;<i>click,&nbsp;<br>whirr&nbsp;</i>mode, we are often as vulnerable to the symbols of authority as to the substance.&nbsp;<br>
Several of&nbsp;these symbols can reliably trigger our compliance in the absence of the&nbsp;<br>genuine substance of authority. Consequently, these symbols are employed extensively&nbsp;<br>by those compliance professionals who are short on substance. Con artists, for example,&nbsp;<br>drape themselves with the titles,&nbsp;the&nbsp;clothes,&nbsp;and the trappings of&nbsp;authority. They love&nbsp;<br>nothing more than to emerge elegantly dressed from&nbsp;a fine automobile and to introduce&nbsp;<br>themselves to their prospective &quot;marks&quot;&nbsp;as Doctor or Judge or Professor or&nbsp;<br>Commissioner Someone. They understand that when they are so adorned their chances&nbsp;<br>for compliance are greatly increased. Each&nbsp;of these three types of symbols of&nbsp;<br>authority—titles, clothes, and trappings—has&nbsp;its own story and is&nbsp;worth a separate look.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Titles</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Titles are simultaneously the most difficult and the easiest&nbsp;symbols of&nbsp;authority to&nbsp;<br>acquire. To earn a title normally takes years of&nbsp;work and achievement. Yet, it is&nbsp;possible&nbsp;<br>for somebody who has put in none of this effort to adopt the mere&nbsp;label and receive a&nbsp;<br>kind of automatic deference. As we have seen, actors in TV commercials&nbsp;and con artists&nbsp;<br>do it successfully all the time.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<a name=199></a><i>Authority&nbsp;</i>189&nbsp;<br>
I recently talked with a friend—a faculty&nbsp;member at a well-known eastern university—<br>who provided a telling illustration of the way&nbsp;our actions are frequently more influenced&nbsp;<br>by a title than by the nature of&nbsp;the person claiming it. My friend travels quite a bit and&nbsp;<br>often finds himself chatting with strangers in bars, restaurants, and airports. He says that&nbsp;<br>he has learned through much experience during&nbsp;these conversations never to use his title&nbsp;<br>of professor. When he does, he finds that the tenor of&nbsp;the interaction changes&nbsp;<br>immediately. People who have been spontaneous and interesting conversation partners&nbsp;<br>for the previous half hour become respectful, accepting, and dull. His opinions that&nbsp;<br>before may have produced a lively exchange now generate extended (and highly&nbsp;<br>grammatical) statements of accord. Annoyed and slightly bewildered by&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>phenomenon—because as he says,&nbsp;&quot;I'm&nbsp;still the&nbsp;same&nbsp;guy they've been talking to for the&nbsp;<br>last 30 minutes, right?&quot;—my friend now regularly lies about his occupation in such&nbsp;<br>situations.&nbsp;<br>
What an eccentric shift from the more typical pattern in&nbsp;which certain compliance&nbsp;<br>practitioners lie about titles they&nbsp;<i>don't&nbsp;</i>truly have. Either way, however, such practiced&nbsp;<br>dishonesty makes the same&nbsp;point&nbsp;about the ability of a symbol&nbsp;of authority to influence&nbsp;<br>behavior.&nbsp;<br>
I wonder whether my professor friend—who is&nbsp;somewhat short—would be so eager to&nbsp;<br>hide his title if he knew that,&nbsp;besides&nbsp;making strangers more accommodating, it also&nbsp;<br>makes them see him&nbsp;as taller. Studies investigating the way in which authority status&nbsp;<br>affects perceptions of size have found that prestigious titles lead to height&nbsp;distortions.&nbsp;In&nbsp;<br>one experiment conducted on five classes of&nbsp;Australian college students, a man was&nbsp;<br>introduced as a visitor from&nbsp;Cambridge University in England. However, his status at&nbsp;<br>Cambridge was represented differently in each&nbsp;of the classes. To one class, he was&nbsp;<br>presented as a student; to a second class, a demonstrator; to&nbsp;another, a lecturer; to yet&nbsp;<br>another, a senior lecturer; to&nbsp;a fifth, a professor. After he&nbsp;left the room, the class was&nbsp;<br>asked to estimate his height.&nbsp;It was found that with each&nbsp;increase in status, the same&nbsp;<br>man grew in perceived height by an average of&nbsp;a half-inch, so that as the &quot;professor&quot; he&nbsp;<br>was seen as 2 1/2 inches taller than as&nbsp;the &quot;student&quot; (P. R. Wilson, 1968). Another study&nbsp;<br>found that after winning an election, politicians become&nbsp;taller in the eyes of the&nbsp;<br>citizenry (Higham&nbsp;&amp; Garment, 1992).&nbsp;<br>
It is worth the time for a small detour to&nbsp;pursue this interesting connection between&nbsp;<br>status and perceived size, as it shows up in&nbsp;a variety of ways. In one study in which&nbsp;<br>children were asked to judge the size of coins, for&nbsp;example,&nbsp;they most overestimated the&nbsp;<br>size of the more valuable coins (Bruner &amp; Goodman, 1947). Adults are just as guilty of&nbsp;<br>such distortions. In a study by Dukes and&nbsp;Bevan (1952), college students drew cards on&nbsp;<br>which were printed monetary values ranging from&nbsp;$3.00 to -$3.00; the students won or&nbsp;<br>lost the amount shown on the cards they picked. Afterward, they were&nbsp;asked to rate the&nbsp;<br>size of each card. Although all the cards were exactly the same&nbsp;size, those that had the&nbsp;<br>extreme values—positive or negative—were seen as physically larger. Thus, it is not&nbsp;<br>necessarily the pleasantness of a thing that&nbsp;makes it seem&nbsp;bigger, it is its importance.&nbsp;<br>

Because we see size and status&nbsp;as related, it&nbsp;is possible for certain individuals to benefit&nbsp;<br>by substituting the former for the latter. In some animal societies, in which the status of&nbsp;<br>an animal is assigned on the basis of dominance, size is an important factor in&nbsp;<br>determining which animal will achieve which status level in the group.3&nbsp;<br>
Usually, in combat with a rival, the larger&nbsp;and more powerful animal wins. To avoid the&nbsp;<br>harmful effects to the group of such physical&nbsp;conflict, however, many species employ&nbsp;<br>methods that frequently&nbsp;involve more form&nbsp;than fracas. The two rivals confront each&nbsp;<br>other with showy aggression displays that&nbsp;invariably include size-enhancing tricks.&nbsp;<br>Various mammals arch their backs&nbsp;and bristle&nbsp;their coats;&nbsp;fish&nbsp;extend their fins and puff&nbsp;<br>themselves up with water;&nbsp;birds unfurl and flutter their wings. Very often, this&nbsp;<br>exhibition alone is enough to send&nbsp;one of the histrionic warriors into retreat leaving the&nbsp;<br>contested status position to&nbsp;the seemingly larger and&nbsp;<br>
stronger rival.&nbsp;<br>
Fur, fins, and feathers. Isn't it interesting&nbsp;how these most delicate of parts can be&nbsp;<br>exploited to give the impression of substance and weight?&nbsp;There are two&nbsp;lessons for us&nbsp;<br>here. One is&nbsp;specific to the association between size and status: The connection of those&nbsp;<br>two features can be profitably employed by individuals who are able to&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
3Subhumans&nbsp;are not alone in this regard, even&nbsp;in modern times. For example, since 1900&nbsp;<br>the U.S. presidency has been won by the taller of the major party candidates in nearly&nbsp;<br>90 percent of the elections. Research suggests that&nbsp;the height advantage may also apply&nbsp;<br>to candidates for affection in contests of&nbsp;the heart: women are significantly more likely&nbsp;<br>to respond to a man's&nbsp;published personal ad&nbsp;when he describes himself as tall.&nbsp;<br>Interestingly for female ad-runners, size works in the opposite direction. Women who&nbsp;<br>report being short and weighing less get more male/mail action&nbsp;(Lynn &amp; Shurgot, 1984;&nbsp;<br>Shepperd &amp; Strathman, 1989).&nbsp;<br>

fake the first to gain the appearance of the&nbsp;second. This possibility&nbsp;is precisely why con&nbsp;<br>artists, even those of average or slightly above average height, commonly wear lifts in&nbsp;<br>their shoes. The other lesson is more&nbsp;general: The outward signs of power&nbsp;and authority&nbsp;<br>frequently may be counterfeited with the flimsiest of materials. Let's return to the realm&nbsp;<br>of titles for an example—an example that involves what, in several ways, is the scariest&nbsp;<br>experiment I know. A group of researchers,&nbsp;composed of doctors and nurses with&nbsp;<br>connections&nbsp;to three midwestern&nbsp;hospitals, became increasingly concerned with&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>extent of mechanical obedience to doctors'&nbsp;orders on the part of nurses. It seemed to the&nbsp;<br>researchers that even highly trained&nbsp;and skilled nurses were not using that training or&nbsp;<br>skill sufficiently to check on a doctor's judgment; instead, when confronted with a&nbsp;<br>physician's directives, they would simply defer.&nbsp;<br>
We saw how this process accounted for the case&nbsp;of the rectally administered ear drops,&nbsp;<br>but the midwestern researchers took things several steps further. First, they wanted to&nbsp;<br>find out whether such cases were isolated incidents or representative of&nbsp;a widespread&nbsp;<br>phenomenon. Second, they wanted to examine&nbsp;the problem&nbsp;in the context of a serious&nbsp;<br>treatment error: the gross over-prescription of an unauthorized&nbsp;drug to a hospital patient.&nbsp;<br>Finally, they wanted to see what would happen if they physically removed the authority&nbsp;<br>figure from&nbsp;the situation&nbsp;and substituted an unfamiliar voice on the phone, offering only&nbsp;<br>the frailest evidence of authority—the claimed title &quot;doctor.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
One of the researchers made&nbsp;an identical phone&nbsp;call to 22 separate nurses'&nbsp;stations on&nbsp;<br>various surgical, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric wards.&nbsp;He identified himself as a&nbsp;<br>hospital physician and directed the answering nurse to give&nbsp;20 milligrams&nbsp;of&nbsp;a drug&nbsp;<br>(Astrogen)&nbsp;to a specific ward&nbsp;patient. There were four excellent reasons for the nurse's&nbsp;<br>caution in response to this order: (1) the&nbsp;prescription was transmitted by phone, in direct&nbsp;<br>violation of hospital policy;&nbsp;(2) the&nbsp;medication&nbsp;itself&nbsp;was unauthorized. Astrogen had&nbsp;<br>not been cleared for use nor placed on&nbsp;the ward stock list; (3) the prescribed dosage was&nbsp;<br>obviously and dangerously excessive. The medication containers clearly stated that the&nbsp;<br>&quot;maximum daily dose&quot; was only 10 milligrams, half&nbsp;of&nbsp;what had been ordered;&nbsp;(4) the&nbsp;<br>directive was given by a man the nurse had never met, seen, or even talked with before&nbsp;<br>on the phone. Yet, in 95 percent of&nbsp;the instances, the nurses&nbsp;went straight to the ward&nbsp;<br>medicine cabinet where they secured&nbsp;the ordered dosage of Astrogen and started for the&nbsp;<br>patient's room to administer it. It was at&nbsp;this point that they were stopped by a secret&nbsp;<br>observer, who revealed the nature of the experiment (Hofling, Brotzman, Dalrymple,&nbsp;<br>Graves, &amp; Pierce, 1966).&nbsp;<br>
The results&nbsp;are frightening indeed.&nbsp;That 95&nbsp;percent of regular staff nurses complied&nbsp;<br>unhesitatingly with a patently&nbsp;improper instruction&nbsp;of this sort must&nbsp;give us all as&nbsp;<br>potential hospital patients great reason for concern. Given the U.S. Health Financing&nbsp;<br>Care Administration estimate of a 12 percent daily medication error rate in American&nbsp;<br>hospitals, stays of longer than&nbsp;a week make it likely that we will be recipients&nbsp;of such&nbsp;an&nbsp;<br>error.&nbsp;What the midwestern study&nbsp;shows is&nbsp;that the mistakes&nbsp;are hardly&nbsp;limited to the&nbsp;<br>trivial slips in the&nbsp;administration of&nbsp;harmless ear drops or&nbsp;the like,&nbsp;but extend to grave&nbsp;<br>and dangerous blunders.&nbsp;<br>

In interpreting their unsettling findings, the&nbsp;researchers came to an instructive&nbsp;<br>conclusion:&nbsp;<br>
<i>In a real-life situation corresponding to the experimental one,&nbsp;there would, in theory, be&nbsp;<br>two professional intelligences, the doctor's&nbsp;and the nurse's, working to ensure that a&nbsp;<br>given procedure be undertaken in a manner beneficial to the patient or, at the very&nbsp;<br>least,&nbsp;not detrimental to&nbsp;him [or her].&nbsp;The experiment strongly suggests, however, that&nbsp;<br>one of these intelligences is, for all practical purposes, nonfunctioning. (Hofling et al,&nbsp;<br>1966, p. 176)</i>&nbsp;<br>
It seems that, in the face of a physician's directives, the nurses unhooked their&nbsp;<br>&quot;professional intelligences&quot; and moved to a&nbsp;<i>click, whirr&nbsp;</i>form&nbsp;of responding. None of&nbsp;<br>their considerable medical training or knowledge was engaged in the decision about&nbsp;<br>what to do. Instead, because obedience to legitimate authority had always been the most&nbsp;<br>preferred and efficient action in their work&nbsp;setting, they were willing to err on the side&nbsp;<br>of&nbsp;automatic&nbsp;obedience. It is all the more instructive that&nbsp;they&nbsp;have traveled so far in this&nbsp;<br>direction that their error had&nbsp;come&nbsp;in response not to genuine authority but to its most&nbsp;<br>easily falsified symbol—a bare title.4&nbsp;<br>
Perhaps as&nbsp;dismaying as the mechanical deference given to individuals whose titles&nbsp;<br>bespeak authority is the evidence for a mechanical resistance to the ideas of individuals&nbsp;<br>whose titles&nbsp;suggest a lack of authority.&nbsp;In the realm&nbsp;of scholarly publication,&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>revealing study was done by psychologists Douglas Peters and Stephen Ceci (1982).&nbsp;<br>They took 12 articles that had been published 18 to 32 months earlier by authors from&nbsp;<br>prestigious universities and, changing nothing&nbsp;but the names&nbsp;and affiliations of the&nbsp;<br>authors to those of unknowns from&nbsp;&quot;Tri-Valley Center for Human Potential,&quot; they&nbsp;<br>resubmitted the articles in manuscript form&nbsp;to&nbsp;the journals that had already published&nbsp;<br>them. Nine of the doctored articles went&nbsp;through the review process undetected and,&nbsp;<br>remarkably, eight were rejected, even though&nbsp;each had been published shortly before by&nbsp;<br>the same journal when it had been submitted&nbsp;by researchers with more prestigious&nbsp;<br>reputations&nbsp;and affiliations. A similar,&nbsp;but less&nbsp;scientific,&nbsp;experiment was tried by&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>popular writer who typed word-for-word Jerzy Kosinski's&nbsp;novel&nbsp;<i>Steps&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>and sent the&nbsp;<br>manuscript to 28 literary agencies and&nbsp;publishing houses 10 years after the book had&nbsp;<br>sold nearly&nbsp;a half&nbsp;million copies&nbsp;and had won the National Book&nbsp;Award. The&nbsp;<br>manuscript, now carrying the name&nbsp;of an unknown, was rejected as inadequate by all 28&nbsp;<br>organizations including Random&nbsp;House, the novel's original publisher (C. Ross, 1979).&nbsp;<br>
4Additional data collected in the Hofling et al. study&nbsp;suggest that nurses may not be&nbsp;<br>conscious of&nbsp;the extent to which the title&nbsp;&quot;doctor&quot; sways their judgments and actions. A&nbsp;<br>separate group of 33 nurses and student nurses were asked what they would have done&nbsp;<br>in the experimental situation. Contrary to&nbsp;the actual findings, only two predicted that&nbsp;<br>they would have given the medication as ordered.&nbsp;<br>

<b>READER'S&nbsp;REPORT 6.1</b>&nbsp;<br>
<b>From a Texas-Based University Professor</b>&nbsp;<br>
I grew up in an Italian ghetto in Warren, Pennsylvania. I occasionally return home to&nbsp;<br>visit family and the like. As in most places&nbsp;these days, most of the small Italian&nbsp;<br>specialty&nbsp;stores are gone, having&nbsp;been replaced&nbsp;by&nbsp;larger supermarkets. My mother sent&nbsp;<br>me&nbsp;supermarket shopping during a visit for&nbsp;a load of canned tomatoes, and I noticed&nbsp;<br>that nearly all the cans of&nbsp;Furmano Italian&nbsp;diced tomatoes were sold out. Searching a bit&nbsp;<br>on the shelf immediately beneath the almost&nbsp;empty shelf, I found a&nbsp;full shelf (loaded,&nbsp;<br>even!) of Furman brand diced tomatoes. Looking closely at the labels, I realized that&nbsp;<br>Furmano is Furman. The company had just added an &quot;o&quot; to its name&nbsp;when distributing&nbsp;<br>some of its products.&nbsp;I guess it must be because, when selling&nbsp;Italian-style foods, you're&nbsp;<br>perceived as more of an authority&nbsp;if your name&nbsp;ends in a vowel.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Author's note:&nbsp;</b>The man who wrote this report also commented that the added letter &quot;o&nbsp;<br>&quot; was doing double duty as an influence trigger in that store.&nbsp;Not only did it lend&nbsp;<br>authority to the manufacturer, in an &quot;Italian ghetto,&quot; it made the company appear&nbsp;<br>similar to its customers.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Clothes</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
A second kind of authority symbol that can&nbsp;trigger our mechanical compliance is&nbsp;<br>clothing. Though more tangible than a title, the&nbsp;cloak of authority is every bit as fake-<br>able. Police bunco files bulge with records&nbsp;of con artists whose&nbsp;methods include the&nbsp;<br>quick change. In chameleon style, they adopt&nbsp;the hospital whites, priestly black, army&nbsp;<br>green, or police blue that the situation requires&nbsp;for maximum&nbsp;advantage. Only too&nbsp;late&nbsp;<br>do their victims realize that the garb of&nbsp;authority is&nbsp;hardly its guarantee.&nbsp;<br>
A series of&nbsp;studies by social psychologist Leonard Bickman (1974) indicates how&nbsp;<br>difficult it can be to resist requests that come&nbsp;from&nbsp;figures in&nbsp;authority attire. Bickman's&nbsp;<br>basic procedure was to ask passersby on the street to comply with some&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;odd&nbsp;<br>request (for example, to pick up a discarded&nbsp;paper bag or to stand on the other side of a&nbsp;<br>bus-stop sign). In half of the instances,&nbsp;the requester—a young man— was dressed in&nbsp;<br>ordinary street clothes: the rest&nbsp;of&nbsp;the time, he wore a&nbsp;security guard's uniform.&nbsp;<br>Regardless of the type of request, many more people obeyed the requester when he was&nbsp;<br>wearing the guard costume. Similar results have been obtained when the uniformed&nbsp;<br>requester was female (Bushman, 1988).&nbsp;<br>
Especially revealing was one&nbsp;version of the experiment in&nbsp;which the requester stopped&nbsp;<br>pedestrians and pointed to&nbsp;a man standing by a parking&nbsp;meter 50 feet away.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<br>requester, whether dressed normally or as a security guard, always said the same&nbsp;thing&nbsp;<br>to the pedestrian, &quot;You see that guy over there by the meter?&nbsp;He's overparked but&nbsp;<br>doesn't&nbsp;have any change. Give him&nbsp;a dime!&quot; The requester then turned a corner&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=204></a>194&nbsp;<i>Chapters</i>&nbsp;<br>
and walked away so that by the time&nbsp;the pedestrian reached the meter, the requester was&nbsp;<br>out of sight. The power&nbsp;of his uniform lasted, however, even after he was long gone:&nbsp;<br>Nearly all of&nbsp;the pedestrians complied with&nbsp;his directive when&nbsp;he wore the guard&nbsp;<br>costume, but fewer than half did&nbsp;so when he was dressed normally.5&nbsp;<br>
It is interesting to note that, later on,&nbsp;Bickman found college students guessed with&nbsp;<br>considerable accuracy the percentage of compliance that occurred in&nbsp;the experiment&nbsp;<br>when the requester wore street clothes (50 percent versus the actual 42 percent); yet, the&nbsp;<br>students greatly underestimated the percentage of compliance when he was in&nbsp;<br>uniform—63 percent versus the&nbsp;actual 92 percent (Bickman, 1974).&nbsp;<br>
Less blatant in its connotation than a uniform,&nbsp;but nonetheless effective, is another kind&nbsp;<br>of&nbsp;attire that&nbsp;has traditionally indicated authority&nbsp;status in our culture:&nbsp;the well-tailored&nbsp;<br>business suit. It, too, can evoke&nbsp;a telling form&nbsp;of deference from&nbsp;total strangers. In a&nbsp;<br>study conducted in Texas, for instance, researchers arranged for a 31-year-old man to&nbsp;<br>violate the law by crossing the street against&nbsp;the traffic light&nbsp;on a variety of occasions.&nbsp;<br>In half of the cases,&nbsp;he was dressed in a&nbsp;freshly pressed business&nbsp;suit and tie; on the&nbsp;<br>other occasions, he wore a work shirt and&nbsp;trousers. The researchers watched from a&nbsp;<br>distance and&nbsp;counted&nbsp;the number of pedestrians&nbsp;waiting at the corner who followed the&nbsp;<br>man across the street. Like the children of&nbsp;Hamlin who crowded after the Pied Piper,&nbsp;<br>3'/2 times as many people swept into traffic behind the suited jaywalker (Lefkowitz,&nbsp;<br>Blake, &amp; Mouton, 1955). In this case, though,&nbsp;the magic came not from his pipe but&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;his pinstripes.&nbsp;<br>
It is noteworthy that the two types of authority apparel shown by these studies to be&nbsp;<br>influential—the guard uniform&nbsp;and the business suit—are combined deftly by&nbsp;<br>confidence artists in a fraud called the&nbsp;<i>bank examiner scheme.&nbsp;</i>The target of the swindle&nbsp;<br>can be anyone, but elderly persons living alone are preferred. The con begins when a&nbsp;<br>man dressed in a properly conservative three-piece business suit appears at the door of a&nbsp;<br>likely victim. Everything about the con&nbsp;man's clothing speaks of propriety and&nbsp;<br>respectability. The white shirt is starched; the wingtip shoes glow darkly. His suit is not&nbsp;<br>trendy but classic: the lapels&nbsp;are three inches wide—no more, no less; the cloth is heavy&nbsp;<br>and substantial, even in July; the tones are muted—business blue, business gray,&nbsp;<br>business black.&nbsp;<br>
He explains to his intended victim—perhaps a widow he secretly followed home from&nbsp;<br>the bank a day or two earlier—that he is a professional bank examiner who, in the&nbsp;<br>course of auditing the books of her bank, has found some&nbsp;seeming irregularities. He&nbsp;<br>thinks he has spotted&nbsp;the culprit, a&nbsp;bank officer who is regularly doctoring reports of&nbsp;<br>transactions in certain accounts. He says that the widow's&nbsp;account may be one of these,&nbsp;<br>but he can't&nbsp;be sure until he has hard&nbsp;evidence; therefore, he has come to ask&nbsp;<br>
5A study by Mauro (1984) may explain why the requester in uniform was effective,&nbsp;<br>even after he&nbsp;had left the scene. Police officers dressed in&nbsp;their traditional uniforms,&nbsp;<br>versus more conventional clothing (blazers and slacks), were rated by observers as more&nbsp;<br>fair, helpful,&nbsp;intelligent, honest, and good.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

for her cooperation. Would she help out by&nbsp;withdrawing her savings so a team of&nbsp;<br>examiners and responsible bank officials can&nbsp;trace the record of the transaction as it&nbsp;<br>passes across the suspect's desk?&nbsp;<br>
Often, the appearance and presentation of &quot;bank examiner&quot; are so impressive that the&nbsp;<br>victim&nbsp;never thinks to check&nbsp;on their validity with&nbsp;even a simple phone call. Instead, she&nbsp;<br>drives to the bank, withdraws all her money,&nbsp;and returns home with&nbsp;it to wait with the&nbsp;<br>examiner for word on the success of the trap. When the message comes, it is delivered&nbsp;<br>by a uniformed &quot;bank guard&quot; who arrives after closing hours to announce that all is&nbsp;<br>well—apparently, the widow's&nbsp;account was not one of those being tampered with.&nbsp;<br>Greatly relieved, the examiner offers gracious thanks and, since the bank is now&nbsp;<br>conveniently closed, instructs&nbsp;the guard to return the widow's money to the vault, to&nbsp;<br>save her the trouble of doing so the next day. With smiles and handshakes all around,&nbsp;<br>the guard leaves with&nbsp;the funds while the&nbsp;examiner expresses a few more minutes of&nbsp;<br>thanks before he, too, exits. Naturally, as the victim&nbsp;eventually discovers, the &quot;guard&quot; is&nbsp;<br>no more a guard than the &quot;examiner&quot; is an&nbsp;examiner. What&nbsp;they are is a pair of bunco&nbsp;<br>artists who have recognized the capacity of&nbsp;carefully counterfeited uniforms to click us&nbsp;<br>into mesmerized compliance with &quot;authority.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Trappings</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Aside from&nbsp;its function in uniforms, clothing&nbsp;can symbolize a more generalized&nbsp;type of&nbsp;<br>authority when it serves an ornamental purpose. Finely styled and expensive clothes&nbsp;<br>carry an aura of status&nbsp;and&nbsp;position, as do similar trappings such as jewelry and cars.&nbsp;<br>The last of these status symbols is particularly interesting in the United States where&nbsp;<br>&quot;the American love affair with the&nbsp;automobile&quot; gives it&nbsp;unusual significance.&nbsp;<br>
According to the findings of a study done in&nbsp;the San Francisco Bay area, owners of&nbsp;<br>prestige autos receive a special kind of&nbsp;deference from&nbsp;others. The experimenters&nbsp;<br>discovered that motorists would wait significantly longer before honking their horns at a&nbsp;<br>new, luxury car stopped in front of a green&nbsp;traffic light than at an older, economy&nbsp;<br>model. The&nbsp;motorists had little patience&nbsp;with the economy-car driver: Nearly&nbsp;all&nbsp;<br>sounded their horns, and the majority of these did so more than once; two simply&nbsp;<br>rammed into the rear&nbsp;bumper. So intimidating was the aura of&nbsp;the prestige automobile,&nbsp;<br>however, that 50 percent of&nbsp;the motorists waited&nbsp;respectfully behind it, never touching&nbsp;<br>their horns until it moved on (Doob &amp; Gross, 1968).&nbsp;<br>
Later the researchers asked college students what they would have done in such&nbsp;<br>situations.&nbsp;Compared to&nbsp;the actual&nbsp;findings&nbsp;of the experiment, the&nbsp;students consistently&nbsp;<br>underestimated the time&nbsp;it would take them&nbsp;to&nbsp;honk at the luxury car. The male students&nbsp;<br>were especially inaccurate, feeling that they&nbsp;would honk faster at the prestige-than at the&nbsp;<br>economy-car driver; of&nbsp;course, the study itself showed just the opposite. Note the&nbsp;<br>similarity&nbsp;of&nbsp;this&nbsp;pattern&nbsp;to much other research on authority pressures. As in Milgram's&nbsp;<br>research, the midwestern hospital nurses'&nbsp;study, and the security guard&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

uniform experiment, people were unable to predict correctly&nbsp;how they or others would&nbsp;<br>react to authority influence.&nbsp;In each&nbsp;instance, the effect&nbsp;of such influence was grossly&nbsp;<br>underestimated. This property of authority&nbsp;status may account for much of its success as&nbsp;<br>a compliance device. Not only does it work forcefully on us, but it does so&nbsp;<br>unexpectedly.&nbsp;<br>
<b>DEFENSE</b>&nbsp;<br>
One protective tactic we can use against authority status is. to remove its element of&nbsp;<br>surprise. Because we typically misperceive&nbsp;the profound impact of authority (and&nbsp;its&nbsp;<br>symbols) on our actions, we become&nbsp;insufficiently cautious about its&nbsp;presence&nbsp;in&nbsp;<br>compliance situations. A&nbsp;fundamental form&nbsp;of defense against this problem, therefore, is&nbsp;<br>a heightened awareness of authority power.&nbsp;When this awareness is coupled with a&nbsp;<br>recognition of how easily authority symbols can be faked, the&nbsp;benefit will be a properly&nbsp;<br>guarded approach to situations involving authority influence attempts.&nbsp;<br>
Sounds simple, right?&nbsp;And in a way it is.&nbsp;A better understanding of the workings of&nbsp;<br>authority influence should help&nbsp;us resist it. Yet,&nbsp;there is a perverse complication— the&nbsp;<br>familiar one inherent in all weapons of influence: We shouldn't want to resist authority&nbsp;<br>altogether or even most of the time. Generally, authority figures know what they are&nbsp;<br>talking about. Physicians, judges, corporate executives, legislative leaders, and the like&nbsp;<br>have typically gained their positions through superior&nbsp;knowledge and judgment. Thus,&nbsp;<br>as a rule, their directives offer excellent counsel.&nbsp;<br>
Authorities, then, are frequently experts; indeed, one dictionary definition of an&nbsp;<br>authority is an expert. In&nbsp;most cases, it would be foolish to try to substitute our less&nbsp;<br>informed judgments for those of an expert, an&nbsp;authority. At the same&nbsp;time, we have seen&nbsp;<br>in settings ranging from street&nbsp;corners to hospitals that it&nbsp;would be foolish to rely&nbsp;on&nbsp;<br>authority direction in all cases. The trick is to be&nbsp;able to recognize without much strain&nbsp;<br>or vigilance when authority directives are best followed and when they are not.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Authoritative&nbsp;Authority</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Posing two questions to ourselves can help&nbsp;enormously to determine when authority&nbsp;<br>directives should and should not be followed. The first question to ask when we are&nbsp;<br>confronted with what appears&nbsp;to be an authority figure's influence attempt is &quot;Is this&nbsp;<br>authority truly an expert?&quot; This question focuses our attention on two crucial pieces of&nbsp;<br>information: the authority's credentials and&nbsp;the&nbsp;relevance&nbsp;of&nbsp;those credentials to the&nbsp;<br>topic at&nbsp;hand. By turning in this simple way to the&nbsp;<i>evidence&nbsp;</i>for authority status, we can&nbsp;<br>avoid the major pitfalls of&nbsp;automatic deference. An illustration or two is in order.&nbsp;<br>
Let's examine the highly successful Robert&nbsp;Young Sanka commercial in this light. If,&nbsp;<br>rather than responding to his &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; association, people had&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=207></a><i>Authority&nbsp;</i>197&nbsp;<br>
focused on Young's&nbsp;actual status as an authority, I am confident that the commercial&nbsp;<br>would not have had so long and productive a run. Obviously, Robert Young did not&nbsp;<br>possess a physician's training or knowledge.&nbsp;We all know that. What he did possess,&nbsp;<br>however, was a physician's&nbsp;<i>title,&nbsp;</i>&quot;M.D.&quot; Now, clearly, it was an empty title, connected&nbsp;<br>to him&nbsp;in our minds through the device of playacting. We&nbsp;all know that, but isn't it&nbsp;<br>fascinating how, when we are&nbsp;<i>whirring&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>along, what is obvious often doesn't matter&nbsp;<br>unless we pay specific attention to it?&nbsp;<br>
That is why&nbsp;the &quot;Is this&nbsp;authority truly an&nbsp;expert?&quot;&nbsp;question can be so valuable— it&nbsp;<br>brings our attention&nbsp;to&nbsp;the obvious. It moves us effortlessly away from&nbsp;a focus on&nbsp;<br>possibly meaningless symbols toward a consideration of genuine authority credentials.&nbsp;<br>What's&nbsp;more, the question forces us to distinguish between relevant authorities and&nbsp;<br>irrelevant&nbsp;authorities. This distinction is&nbsp;easy&nbsp;to forget&nbsp;when the push of&nbsp;authority&nbsp;<br>pressure is combined with the rush of&nbsp;modern life. The Texas pedestrians who bustled&nbsp;<br>into city traffic behind a business-suited jaywalker are prime examples. Even if the man&nbsp;<br>were the business authority his clothes suggested he might&nbsp;be, he was unlikely to be a&nbsp;<br>greater authority on crossing the street than those who followed him&nbsp;into traffic.&nbsp;<br>
Still, they did follow, as if&nbsp;his label,&nbsp;<i>authority,&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>overwhelmed the vital difference&nbsp;<br>between relevant and irrelevant forms. Had&nbsp;they bothered to ask themselves whether he&nbsp;<br>represented a true expert in the situation, someone whose actions indicated superior&nbsp;<br>knowledge, I expect the result would have&nbsp;been quite different. The same&nbsp;process&nbsp;<br>applies to Robert Young, a man who was not&nbsp;without expertise.&nbsp;He had a long career&nbsp;<br>with many achievements in a difficult business. However, his skills and knowledge&nbsp;<br>were as an actor, not a doctor. When, in&nbsp;viewing the famous coffee commercial, we&nbsp;<br>focus on his true credentials, we realize quickly that he should be no more&nbsp;believed than&nbsp;<br>would be any other successful actor who claims that Sanka is healthful.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Sly Sincerity</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Suppose, though, that we are confronted&nbsp;with an authority who we determine&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>a&nbsp;<br>relevant expert. Before submitting to&nbsp;authority&nbsp;influence, we should ask a second simple&nbsp;<br>question, &quot;How truthful can we&nbsp;expect the expert&nbsp;to be?&quot; Authorities, even the best&nbsp;<br>informed, may not present their information&nbsp;honestly to us; therefore, we need to&nbsp;<br>consider their trustworthiness in the situation.&nbsp;Most of the time we do. We&nbsp;allow&nbsp;<br>ourselves to be swayed more by experts who seem&nbsp;to be impartial than by those who&nbsp;<br>have something to gain by&nbsp;convincing us (Eagly, Wood,&nbsp;<i>&amp;&nbsp;</i>Chaiken, 1978); research has&nbsp;<br>shown this to be true around the world (McGuinnies&nbsp;<i>&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Ward, 1980). By wondering&nbsp;<br>how an expert stands to benefit from our compliance, we give ourselves another safety&nbsp;<br>net against undue and automatic influence.&nbsp;Even knowledgeable authorities in a field&nbsp;<br>will not persuade us until we are&nbsp;satisfied that their messages represent the facts&nbsp;<br>faithfully.&nbsp;<br>
When asking ourselves about an authority's&nbsp;trustworthiness, we should keep in mind a&nbsp;<br>little&nbsp;tactic compliance practitioners&nbsp;often use&nbsp;to&nbsp;assure&nbsp;us of&nbsp;their sincerity: They will&nbsp;<br>argue somewhat against their own interests. Correctly practiced, this&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

approach can be a subtle yet effective device for &quot;proving&quot; their honesty. Perhaps they&nbsp;<br>will mention a small shortcoming in their position&nbsp;or product (&quot;Oh, the disadvantages of&nbsp;<br>Benson &amp; Hedges&quot;). Invariably though, the drawback will be a secondary one that is&nbsp;<br>easily overcome by more significant advantages—&quot;Listerine, the taste you hate three&nbsp;<br>times a day&quot;; &quot;Avis: We're number two, but&nbsp;we try harder&quot;; &quot;L'Oreal, a bit more&nbsp;<br>expensive and worth it.&quot; By establishing their basic truthfulness on minor issues, the&nbsp;<br>compliance professionals who use this ploy can&nbsp;then be more believable when stressing&nbsp;<br>the important aspects of their argument&nbsp;(Hunt, Domzal, &amp; Kernan, 1981; Settle &amp;&nbsp;<br>Gorden, 1974; Smith &amp; Hunt, 1978).&nbsp;<br>
I have seen&nbsp;this approach used with devastating effect in a place that few of us&nbsp;<br>recognize as a compliance setting—a restaurant. It is no secret&nbsp;that, because of&nbsp;<br>shamelessly low wages, servers in restaurants must supplement their earnings with tips.&nbsp;<br>Leaving the&nbsp;<i>sine qua non&nbsp;</i>of good service aside, the most successful waiters and&nbsp;<br>waitresses know certain tricks&nbsp;for increasing tips. They also know that the larger a&nbsp;<br>customer's bill, the larger&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;money they are likely to receive&nbsp;in a standard&nbsp;<br>gratuity. In these two regards, then—building&nbsp;the size of the customer's charge and&nbsp;<br>building the percentage of that&nbsp;charge that is given as a&nbsp;tip—servers regularly act as&nbsp;<br>compliance agents.&nbsp;<br>
Hoping to find out how they operate, I applied for a position as a waiter at several fairly&nbsp;<br>expensive restaurants. Without experience,&nbsp;though, the best I could do was to land a&nbsp;<br>busboy job that, as things turned&nbsp;out, provided&nbsp;me&nbsp;a propitious vantage point from&nbsp;<br>which to watch and analyze the action. Before long, I realized what the other employees&nbsp;<br>already knew: that the most successful waiter in the place was Vincent who somehow&nbsp;<br>arranged for patrons to order more and tip higher. The other servers&nbsp;were not even close&nbsp;<br>to him&nbsp;in weekly earnings.&nbsp;<br>
So I began to linger in my duties around Vincent's tables to observe his technique. I&nbsp;<br>quickly learned that his style was to have no single style. He had a repertoire of&nbsp;<br>approaches,&nbsp;each ready&nbsp;to be used&nbsp;under the appropriate circumstances. When the&nbsp;<br>customers were a family, he was effervescent—even slightly clownish— directing his&nbsp;<br>remarks as often to the children as the adults. With a young couple&nbsp;on a date, he became&nbsp;<br>formal and a bit imperious in an attempt to intimidate the young man (to whom&nbsp;he&nbsp;<br>spoke exclusively) into ordering and tipping lavishly. With an&nbsp;older, married couple, he&nbsp;<br>retained the formality but dropped the superior&nbsp;air in favor of a respectful orientation to&nbsp;<br>both members of the couple. Should the patron be dining alone, Vincent selected a&nbsp;<br>friendly demeanor—cordial,&nbsp;conversational, and warm.&nbsp;<br>
Vincent reserved the trick of&nbsp;seeming to argue&nbsp;against his own interests for large parties&nbsp;<br>of 8 to 12 people. His technique was veined&nbsp;with genius. When it was time for the first&nbsp;<br>person, normally a woman, to order, he went&nbsp;into his act. No matter what she elected,&nbsp;<br>Vincent reacted identically: His brow furrowed, his hand hovered above his order pad,&nbsp;<br>and after looking quickly over his shoulder for&nbsp;the manager, he leaned conspiratorially&nbsp;<br>toward the table to report for all to&nbsp;hear &quot;I'm&nbsp;afraid that is not as good&nbsp;<br>

tonight as it normally is.&nbsp;Might I recommend instead the___or the___?&quot; (At this&nbsp;<br>
point, Vincent suggested a pair of menu items&nbsp;that were slightly less expensive than the&nbsp;<br>dish the patron had selected initially.) &quot;They are both excellent tonight.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
With this single maneuver, Vincent engaged several important principles of influence.&nbsp;<br>First, even those who did not&nbsp;take his suggestions felt that Vincent had done them&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>favor by offering valuable information to help them order. Everyone felt grateful, and&nbsp;<br>consequently, the rule for reciprocity would&nbsp;work in his&nbsp;favor when it came time&nbsp;for&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;to decide on his gratuity. Besides hiking the percentage of his tip, Vincent's&nbsp;<br>maneuver also placed him&nbsp;in a favorable position to&nbsp;increase the&nbsp;size of the party's&nbsp;<br>order. It established him as an authority on&nbsp;the current stores of&nbsp;the house: he clearly&nbsp;<br>knew what was and wasn't&nbsp;good that night.&nbsp;Moreover—and here is where seeming to&nbsp;<br>argue against his own interests comes in—it&nbsp;proved him&nbsp;to be a trustworthy informant&nbsp;<br>because he recommended dishes&nbsp;that were slightly&nbsp;<i>less&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>expensive than the one&nbsp;<br>originally&nbsp;ordered. Rather than&nbsp;trying to line his own pockets, he seemed to have the&nbsp;<br>customers'&nbsp;best interests at heart.&nbsp;<br>
To all appearances, he was at once knowledgeable and honest, a combination that gave&nbsp;<br>him&nbsp;great credibility.&nbsp;Vincent was quick to&nbsp;exploit the advantage of&nbsp;this&nbsp;credible&nbsp;image.&nbsp;<br>When the party had finished giving their&nbsp;food orders, he would say, &quot;Very well, and&nbsp;<br>would you like me&nbsp;to suggest or select wine&nbsp;to go with your meals?&quot; As I watched the&nbsp;<br>scene repeated almost nightly, there was a notable consistency to the customer's&nbsp;<br>reaction—smiles, nods, and, for the most part, general assent.&nbsp;<br>
Even from&nbsp;my vantage point, I could read&nbsp;their thoughts from&nbsp;their faces. &quot;Sure,&quot; the&nbsp;<br>customers seemed to say, &quot;You know what's good here, and you're obviously on our&nbsp;<br>side. Tell us what to get.&quot; Looking pleased,&nbsp;Vincent, who did know his vintages, would&nbsp;<br>respond with some&nbsp;excellent (and costly) choices. He was similarly persuasive when it&nbsp;<br>came time for dessert decisions. Patrons&nbsp;who otherwise would have passed up the&nbsp;<br>dessert course or shared with a friend were swayed to partake fully&nbsp;by Vincent's&nbsp;<br>rapturous descriptions of the baked Alaska and chocolate&nbsp;mousse. Who, after all, is&nbsp;<br>more believable than a demonstrated expert of proven sincerity?&nbsp;<br>
By combining the factors of reciprocity and&nbsp;credible&nbsp;authority&nbsp;into&nbsp;a single, elegant&nbsp;<br>maneuver, Vincent was&nbsp;able to inflate substantially both the percentage of his tip and&nbsp;<br>the base charge on which it was figured. His proceeds from this trick were handsome&nbsp;<br>indeed. Notice, though, that much of his profit came&nbsp;from&nbsp;an apparent lack of concern&nbsp;<br>for personal profit. Seeming to argue against his financial interests served those interests&nbsp;<br>extremely well.6&nbsp;<br>
This same&nbsp;strategy can be used effectively in&nbsp;a variety of other situations as well. For&nbsp;<br>example, one researcher found that letters&nbsp;of recommendation sent to the personnel&nbsp;<br>directors of major corporations produced the most favorable results for job candidates&nbsp;<br>when the letters contained one unflattering comment about the candidates in an&nbsp;<br>otherwise wholly positive set of&nbsp;specific remarks (Knouse, 1983).&nbsp;<br>

<a name=210></a><b>READER'S REPORT 6.2 From a Young Businessman</b>&nbsp;<br>
About two years ago, I was trying to sell my&nbsp;old car. One day I passed a used car lot&nbsp;<br>with a sign reading, &quot;We will sell your car for more.&quot; Just&nbsp;what I wanted, I thought; so, I&nbsp;<br>stopped in to talk with the owner. I told&nbsp;him&nbsp;I wanted to get about $3,000 for my old&nbsp;<br>car, and&nbsp;he said he thought I should&nbsp;be asking for a lot more&nbsp;because it was worth at&nbsp;<br>least $3,500. This came as a real surprise&nbsp;to me&nbsp;because the way their consignment&nbsp;<br>system&nbsp;worked the larger my asking price for the car, the less money was left over for&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;to keep after they sold&nbsp;it to somebody. By telling me&nbsp;to ask for more than $3,000,&nbsp;<br>they were cutting off their own profits. Just&nbsp;like your Vincent the waiter example, they&nbsp;<br>were seeming to argue against their own interests&nbsp;so I'd see them&nbsp;as trustworthy&nbsp;<br>authorities, but I didn't realize this until much later. Anyway, I went along with the&nbsp;<br>owner's idea that my&nbsp;car&nbsp;was worth more than&nbsp;I'd first thought, and set my asking price&nbsp;<br>at $3,500.&nbsp;<br>
After they'd&nbsp;had my&nbsp;car on their lot for a&nbsp;couple of days, they&nbsp;called saying that&nbsp;<br>someone was really interested&nbsp;in it but that&nbsp;the price was a little&nbsp;too high. Would I be&nbsp;<br>willing to drop my&nbsp;price by $200 to&nbsp;sell the car?&nbsp;Convinced that&nbsp;they had&nbsp;my&nbsp;interests at&nbsp;<br>heart, I agreed. The next day they called back to say the buyer's financing had fallen&nbsp;<br>through and that he couldn't buy the car. In the next two weeks, I got two more calls&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;the dealership, each asking me&nbsp;to drop my&nbsp;price $200 to seal a sale to some&nbsp;<br>customer. Both times I OK'd&nbsp;it because I still believed they were&nbsp;trustworthy. But each&nbsp;<br>time, the alleged deal fell through. I was&nbsp;suspicions enough to call a friend whose&nbsp;<br>family was in the car business. He said this&nbsp;was an old trick designed to get sellers like&nbsp;<br>me&nbsp;to reduce their asking prices to super low levels, giving the dealership big profits&nbsp;<br>when they finally sold the car.&nbsp;<br>
So, I went over there and took my&nbsp;car. As I&nbsp;was leaving, they were still trying to&nbsp;<br>persuade me to let them&nbsp;keep it because they&nbsp;had a &quot;hot prospect&quot; they were sure would&nbsp;<br>buy it if I'd only knock off another $200.&nbsp;<br>
<i>Author's&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>note:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Once again, we see the influence of the contrast principle combining&nbsp;<br>with the principle of primary interest. In&nbsp;this case, after the $3,500 figure was set, each&nbsp;<br>$200 nick seemed small in comparison.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<b>SUMMARY</b>&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;In the Milgram&nbsp;studies of obedience we can&nbsp;see evidence of strong pressure in our&nbsp;<br>society for compliance with the&nbsp;requests of&nbsp;an authority. Acting contrary to&nbsp;their own&nbsp;<br>preferences, many normal, psychologically healthy individuals were&nbsp;willing to deliver&nbsp;<br>dangerous and severe levels of&nbsp;pain to another person because&nbsp;they were directed&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;<br>so by an authority figure. The strength of&nbsp;this tendency to obey legitimate authorities&nbsp;<br>comes from&nbsp;systematic socialization&nbsp;practices de-&nbsp;<br>

signed to&nbsp;instill in&nbsp;members of&nbsp;society the&nbsp;perception that such&nbsp;obedience constitutes&nbsp;<br>correct conduct. In addition, it is frequently&nbsp;adaptive to obey the dictates of genuine&nbsp;<br>authorities because such individuals usually&nbsp;possess high&nbsp;levels of knowledge, wisdom,&nbsp;<br>and power. For these reasons, deference to authorities can occur in a mindless fashion as&nbsp;<br>a kind of decision-making shortcut.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;When reacting to authority in&nbsp;an automatic fashion, there is a tendency to do so in&nbsp;<br>response to the mere symbols of authority rather than to its substance. Three kinds of&nbsp;<br>symbols that&nbsp;have been shown by research to&nbsp;be effective in this regard are titles,&nbsp;<br>clothing, and automobiles. In separate studies investigating the influence of these&nbsp;<br>symbols, individuals possessing one or another of them&nbsp;(and no other legitimizing&nbsp;<br>credentials) were accorded more deference&nbsp;or obedience by&nbsp;those they encountered.&nbsp;<br>Moreover, in each instance, individuals&nbsp;who deferred or obeyed underestimated the&nbsp;<br>effect of authority pressures on their behaviors.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;It is possible to&nbsp;defend ourselves against the&nbsp;detrimental effects of&nbsp;authority&nbsp;influence&nbsp;<br>by asking two questions: Is this authority truly an expert?&nbsp;How truthful can we expect&nbsp;<br>this expert to be?&nbsp;The first question directs&nbsp;our attention away from&nbsp;symbols and toward&nbsp;<br>evidence for authority status.&nbsp;The second advises us to consider not just the expert's&nbsp;<br>knowledge in the situation but also his or her&nbsp;trustworthiness. With&nbsp;regard to this second&nbsp;<br>consideration, we should be alert to the trust-enhancing tactic in which communicators&nbsp;<br>first provide some&nbsp;mildly negative information about themselves. Through this strategy&nbsp;<br>they create a perception of honesty that makes all subsequent information seem&nbsp;more&nbsp;<br>credible to observers.&nbsp;<br>

<hr>
<a name=214></a>The city of Mesa, Arizona, is&nbsp;a suburb in&nbsp;the Phoenix area where I live. Perhaps&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>most notable features of Mesa are its sizable Mormon population—next to Salt Lake&nbsp;<br>City, the largest in the world—and a huge Mormon temple located on exquisitely kept&nbsp;<br>grounds in the center of the city. Although I had appreciated the landscaping and&nbsp;<br>architecture from&nbsp;a distance, I had never&nbsp;been interested enough&nbsp;in the temple to go&nbsp;<br>inside, until the day I read a&nbsp;newspaper article that told of&nbsp;a special inner sector&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>Mormon temples to which no one has access but faithful members of the church. Even&nbsp;<br>potential converts must not see&nbsp;it; however, there is one&nbsp;exception to the&nbsp;rule. For a few&nbsp;<br>days immediately after a temple is newly&nbsp;constructed, non-members are allowed to tour&nbsp;<br>the entire structure, including the otherwise restricted section.&nbsp;<br>
The newspaper story reported that the Mesa temple had been recently refurbished&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br>that the renovations had been extensive enough to classify it as &quot;new&quot; by church&nbsp;<br>standards. Thus, for the next several days only, non-Mormon visitors could see the&nbsp;<br>temple area traditionally&nbsp;banned to them. I remember quite well the effect this article&nbsp;<br>had on me: I immediately resolved to take a&nbsp;tour; but when I phoned a friend to ask if he&nbsp;<br>wanted to come&nbsp;along, I came to understand something that changed my decision just as&nbsp;<br>quickly.&nbsp;<br>
After declining the invitation, my friend wondered why / seemed so intent on a visit. I&nbsp;<br>was forced to admit that, no, I had never been&nbsp;inclined toward the idea of a temple tour&nbsp;<br>before, that I had no questions about the Mormon religion I wanted answered, that I had&nbsp;<br>no general interest in church architecture,&nbsp;and that I expected to find nothing more&nbsp;<br>spectacular or stirring than what&nbsp;I might see at a number of other churches in the area.&nbsp;It&nbsp;<br>became clear as I spoke that the special lure of the temple&nbsp;had a sole cause: If I did not&nbsp;<br>experience the restricted&nbsp;sector&nbsp;soon, I would never again have the chance. Something&nbsp;<br>that, on its own merits, held little appeal&nbsp;for me had become&nbsp;decidedly more attractive&nbsp;<br>merely because it was rapidly becoming less available.&nbsp;<br>
<b>LESS IS BEST AND LOSS IS WORST________________________</b>&nbsp;<br>
I count myself far from alone in this weakness. Almost everyone is vulnerable to the&nbsp;<br>scarcity principle in some&nbsp;form. Take as&nbsp;evidence the experience of Florida State&nbsp;<br>University students who, like most undergraduates when surveyed, rated the quality of&nbsp;<br>their campus cafeteria food unsatisfactory. Nine days later, according to a second&nbsp;<br>survey, they had changed their minds. Something had happened to make them&nbsp;like their&nbsp;<br>cafeteria's&nbsp;food significantly better than before. Interestingly,&nbsp;the event that caused them&nbsp;<br>to shift their opinions had nothing to do with the quality of&nbsp;the food service, which had&nbsp;<br>not changed a whit. But its availability&nbsp;had. On the day of the second survey, the&nbsp;<br>students had&nbsp;learned that, because of&nbsp;a fire,&nbsp;they could not eat at the cafeteria for the&nbsp;<br>next two weeks (West, 1975).&nbsp;<br>

<a name=215></a><i>Scarcity&nbsp;</i>205&nbsp;<br>
Collectors of&nbsp;everything&nbsp;from&nbsp;baseball cards to&nbsp;antiques are keenly aware of the scarcity&nbsp;<br>principle's influence in determining&nbsp;the worth of&nbsp;an item.&nbsp;As a rule, if&nbsp;an item&nbsp;is rare or&nbsp;<br>becoming rare, it is more valuable. Especially enlightening on the importance of&nbsp;<br>scarcity in the collectibles market is the&nbsp;phenomenon of the &quot;precious mistake.&quot; Flawed&nbsp;<br>items—a blurred stamp or double-struck coin—are sometimes the most valued of all,&nbsp;<br>Thus, a stamp carrying&nbsp;a three-eyed likeness of George Washington is anatomically&nbsp;<br>incorrect, aesthetically unappealing, and yet highly sought after. There is instructive&nbsp;<br>irony here: Imperfections that would otherwise make for rubbish make for prized&nbsp;<br>possessions when they bring along an abiding scarcity.&nbsp;<br>
Since my own encounter with the scarcity principle—<i>that opportunities seem more&nbsp;<br>valuable to us when they are less available</i>—I have begun to notice its influence over a&nbsp;<br>whole range of my actions. For instance, I routinely will interrupt an interesting face-to-<br>face conversation to answer the ring&nbsp;of an unknown caller. In&nbsp;such a situation, the caller&nbsp;<br>possesses a compelling feature that my&nbsp;face-to-face partner does not—potential&nbsp;<br>unavailability. If I don't take the call, I might&nbsp;miss it (and the information it carries) for&nbsp;<br>good. Never mind that the present conversation may be highly engaging or important—<br>much more&nbsp;than I could reasonably expect&nbsp;an&nbsp;average phone call to be. With each&nbsp;<br>unanswered ring, the phone interaction becomes&nbsp;less retrievable. For that reason and for&nbsp;<br>that moment, I want it more&nbsp;than the other conversation.&nbsp;<br>
People seem&nbsp;to be more motivated by the&nbsp;thought of losing something than by the&nbsp;<br>thought of gaining something of equal value.&nbsp;For instance, college&nbsp;students experienced&nbsp;<br>much stronger emotions when asked to imagine losses as opposed&nbsp;to gains in their&nbsp;<br>romantic relationships or&nbsp;in their grade&nbsp;point averages (Ketelaar,&nbsp;1995). Especially&nbsp;<br>under conditions of risk and&nbsp;uncertainty, the threat of&nbsp;potential loss plays a powerful&nbsp;<br>role in human decision making (Tversky&nbsp;&amp; Kahneman, 1981; De Dreu &amp; McCusker,&nbsp;<br>1997). Health researchers Alexander Rothman and Peter Salovey have applied this&nbsp;<br>insight to the medical arena, where individuals&nbsp;are frequently urged to undergo tests to&nbsp;<br>detect existing illnesses (e.g., mammography&nbsp;procedures, HIV screenings, cancer self-<br>examinations). Because such tests involve the risk that a disease will be found and the&nbsp;<br>uncertainty that it will be cured, messages stressing potential losses are most effective&nbsp;<br>(Rothman &amp; Salovey, 1997; Rothman, Martino, Bedell, Detweiler, &amp; Salovey, 1999).&nbsp;<br>For example, pamphlets advising young women to check for breast cancer through self-<br>examinations are significantly more successful&nbsp;if they state their case in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;what&nbsp;<br>stands to be lost rather than gained (Mey-erwitz &amp; Chaiken, 1987). In a similar vein,&nbsp;<br>physicians'&nbsp;letters to smokers describing the number of years of life that will be lost&nbsp;if&nbsp;<br>they don't quit are more effective than letters&nbsp;describing the number of&nbsp;years that will be&nbsp;<br>gained if they do quit (Wilson, Kaplan, &amp; Schneiderman, 1987; Wilson, Purdon, &amp;&nbsp;<br>Wallston, 1988).&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Limited Numbers</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
With the scarcity principle operating so powerfully on the worth we assign things, it is&nbsp;<br>natural that&nbsp;compliance professionals will do some similar operating of&nbsp;their&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

own. Probably the most straightforward use&nbsp;of&nbsp;the scarcity principle&nbsp;occurs&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>&quot;limited-number&quot; tactic in which a customer&nbsp;is informed that a&nbsp;certain product is in&nbsp;<br>short supply that cannot be guaranteed to&nbsp;last long. During the time I was researching&nbsp;<br>compliance strategies by&nbsp;infiltrating&nbsp;various organizations, I saw the limited-number&nbsp;<br>tactic employed repeatedly in&nbsp;a range of situations: &quot;There aren't&nbsp;more than five&nbsp;<br>convertibles with this engine left in the state. And when they're gone, that's it, 'cause&nbsp;<br>we're not making 'em&nbsp;anymore.&quot; &quot;This is one of&nbsp;only two unsold corner&nbsp;lots in&nbsp;the entire&nbsp;<br>development. You wouldn't want the other&nbsp;one; it's got a nasty east-west exposure.&quot;&nbsp;<br>&quot;You may want to think seriously about buying more than one case today because&nbsp;<br>production is backed way up and there's no telling when we'll&nbsp;get any more in.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Sometimes the limited-number information was true,&nbsp;sometimes it was wholly false.&nbsp;In&nbsp;<br>each instance, however, the intent was to convince customers of an item's scarcity and&nbsp;<br>thereby&nbsp;increase its&nbsp;immediate value in their eyes. I admit to developing a grudging&nbsp;<br>admiration for the practitioners who made this simple device work in a multitude&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>ways and styles. I -was most impressed,&nbsp;however, with a particular version that&nbsp;<br>extended the basic approach to its&nbsp;logical&nbsp;extreme by selling a piece of&nbsp;merchandise at&nbsp;<br>its scarcest point—when it seemingly could no&nbsp;longer be had. The tactic was played to&nbsp;<br>perfection in one appliance store I investigated where 30 to&nbsp;50 percent of&nbsp;the stock&nbsp;was&nbsp;<br>regularly listed on sale. Suppose a couple in the store seemed, from&nbsp;a distance, to be&nbsp;<br>moderately interested in a certain sale item.&nbsp;There are all sorts of cues that tip off such&nbsp;<br>interest—closer-than-normal examination&nbsp;of the appliance,&nbsp;a casual look at any&nbsp;<br>instruction booklets associated with the appliance, discussions held in front of the&nbsp;<br>appliance, but no attempt to&nbsp;seek out a salesperson for further information. After&nbsp;<br>observing the couple so engaged, a salesperson might approach and say, &quot;I see you're&nbsp;<br>interested in this model here, and I can understand why: it's a great machine at a great&nbsp;<br>price. But, unfortunately, I sold it to another couple not&nbsp;more than 20 minutes ago. And,&nbsp;<br>if I'm&nbsp;not mistaken, it was the last one we had.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
The customers'&nbsp;disappointment registers unmistakably. Because of its&nbsp;lost availability,&nbsp;<br>the appliance suddenly becomes&nbsp;more attractive. Typically, one of the customers asks if&nbsp;<br>there is any chance that an unsold model still exists in&nbsp;the store's&nbsp;back room or&nbsp;<br>warehouse or other location. &quot;Well,&quot; the salesperson allows, &quot;that is possible, and I'd be&nbsp;<br>willing to check. But do I understand that this is the model&nbsp;you want and if I can get it&nbsp;<br>for you at this price, you'll take&nbsp;it?&quot; Therein lies the beauty&nbsp;of the technique. In accord&nbsp;<br>with the scarcity principle the customers&nbsp;are asked to commit to buying the appliance&nbsp;<br>when it looks least available and therefore&nbsp;most desirable. Many customers do agree to&nbsp;<br>purchase at this singularly vulnerable time. Thus, when the salesperson (invariably)&nbsp;<br>returns with the news that an additional&nbsp;supply of the appliance has been found, it is&nbsp;<br>also with a pen and sales contract in hand. The information that the desired model is in&nbsp;<br>good supply actually may make some customers find it less attractive again (Schwarz,&nbsp;<br>1984), although by then the business transaction has progressed too far for most people&nbsp;<br>to renege. The purchase decision made and committed to publicly at&nbsp;an earlier, crucial&nbsp;<br>point still holds. They buy.&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Time Limits</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Related to the limited-number technique is the &quot;deadline&quot; tactic in which some official&nbsp;<br>time limit is placed&nbsp;on&nbsp;the customer's opportunity&nbsp;to&nbsp;get what the compliance&nbsp;<br>professional is offering. Much like my experience with the Mormon temple's inner&nbsp;<br>sanctum, people frequently find themselves&nbsp;doing what they wouldn't much care to do&nbsp;<br>simply because the time&nbsp;to do so is running out. The adept merchandiser makes this&nbsp;<br>tendency pay off by arranging and publicizing customer deadlines&nbsp;that&nbsp;generate interest&nbsp;<br>where none may have existed before. Concentrated instances of this approach often&nbsp;<br>occur in&nbsp;movie advertising. In fact, I recently&nbsp;noticed&nbsp;that one theater owner, with&nbsp;<br>remarkable singleness of purpose, had managed to invoke the scarcity principle three&nbsp;<br>separate times in just five words of copy:&nbsp;&quot;Exclusive, limited engagement ends soon!&quot; A&nbsp;<br>variant of&nbsp;the deadline&nbsp;tactic&nbsp;is&nbsp;much favored by some&nbsp;face-to-face, high-pressure&nbsp;<br>sellers because it carries&nbsp;the ultimate decision deadline: right now. Customers&nbsp;<br>

are often told that unless they&nbsp;make&nbsp;an immediate decision&nbsp;to buy, they will have to&nbsp;<br>purchase&nbsp;the&nbsp;item&nbsp;at a higher price&nbsp;later&nbsp;or they&nbsp;will be unable to purchase it at all.&nbsp;A&nbsp;<br>prospective health-club member or automobile buyer might Learn that the deal offered&nbsp;<br>by the salesperson is good for&nbsp;that one time&nbsp;only; should&nbsp;the customer leave the&nbsp;<br>premises, the deal is off. One large child-portrait photography company urges parents to&nbsp;<br>buy as many poses and copies as they can afford because &quot;stocking limitations force us&nbsp;<br>to burn the unsold pictures of your children within 24 hours.&quot; A door-to-door magazine&nbsp;<br>solicitor might say that salespeople are in the&nbsp;customer's&nbsp;area for just a day; after that,&nbsp;<br>they, and the customer's&nbsp;chance to buy their magazine package, will be long gone. A&nbsp;<br>home vacuum&nbsp;cleaner operation I infiltrated instructed&nbsp;its sales trainees&nbsp;to claim&nbsp;that,&nbsp;&quot;I&nbsp;<br>have so many other people to see that I have&nbsp;the time to visit a family only once. It's&nbsp;<br>company policy that even if&nbsp;you decide later that you want this machine, I can't&nbsp;come&nbsp;<br>back and sell it to you.&quot; This, of course, is nonsense; the company and its&nbsp;<br>representatives are in the business of making sales, and any customer who called for&nbsp;<br>another visit would be accommodated gladly. As&nbsp;the company sales manager impressed&nbsp;<br>on his trainees, the true purpose of the &quot;can't&nbsp;come&nbsp;back&quot; claim&nbsp;has nothing to do with&nbsp;<br>reducing overburdened sales schedules. It&nbsp;is to &quot;keep the&nbsp;prospects from&nbsp;taking the time&nbsp;<br>to think&nbsp;the&nbsp;deal over by scaring them&nbsp;into believing they&nbsp;can't&nbsp;have it later, which&nbsp;<br>makes them&nbsp;want it now.&quot;&nbsp;<br>

The evidence, then,&nbsp;is&nbsp;clear. Compliance practitioners'&nbsp;reliance on scarcity as a weapon&nbsp;<br>of influence is frequent, wide-ranging, systematic, and diverse. Whenever this is the&nbsp;<br>case with a weapon of influence, we can be&nbsp;assured that the principle involved has&nbsp;<br>notable power in directing human action. With&nbsp;the scarcity principle, that power comes&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;two major sources.&nbsp;The first is&nbsp;familiar.&nbsp;Like the other weapons of influence,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>scarcity principle trades on&nbsp;our weakness for shortcuts. The weakness is, as before, an&nbsp;<br><i>enlightened&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>one. We&nbsp;know that the things that are&nbsp;difficult to get are typically better&nbsp;<br>than those that are easy to&nbsp;get (Lynn, 1989). As such, we&nbsp;can often use an item's&nbsp;<br>availability to help us quickly and correctly decide on its quality. Thus, one reason for&nbsp;<br>the potency&nbsp;of the scarcity principle is&nbsp;that, by following it, we are usually and&nbsp;<br>efficiently right.1&nbsp;In addition, there is a unique, secondary source of power within the&nbsp;<br>scarcity principle: As opportunities become&nbsp;less available,&nbsp;we lose freedoms. And we&nbsp;<br><i>hate&nbsp;</i>to lose the freedoms we already have. This desire to preserve our established&nbsp;<br>
'Without wishing to minimize the advantage of&nbsp;this type of shortcut or the dangers&nbsp;<br>associated with it, I should note that these&nbsp;advantages and&nbsp;dangers&nbsp;are essentially the&nbsp;<br>same ones that we have examined in previous chapters. Accordingly, I will not focus on&nbsp;<br>this theme in the remainder of&nbsp;the present chapter, except to say at this point that the key&nbsp;<br>to properly using the shortcut feature of scarcity&nbsp;is to be alert to the distinction between&nbsp;<br>naturally occurring, honest scarcity and the fabricated variety favored by certain&nbsp;<br>compliance practitioners.&nbsp;<br>

prerogatives&nbsp;is the centerpiece of&nbsp;psychological reactance theory, developed by&nbsp;<br>psychologist Jack Brehm to explain the human response to diminishing personal control&nbsp;<br>'. W. Brehm, 1966; S. S.&nbsp;Brehm&nbsp;&amp; J. W.&nbsp;Brehm, 1981). According to the theory&nbsp;<br>whenever free choice is limited or threatened,&nbsp;the need to retain our&nbsp;freedoms makes us&nbsp;<br>want them&nbsp;(as well as the goods and services&nbsp;associated with them) significantly ore&nbsp;<br>than before.&nbsp;Therefore, when increasing scarcity-or anything&nbsp;else—interferes with our&nbsp;<br>prior access to some&nbsp;item, we will&nbsp;<i>react against&nbsp;</i>the interference by wanting and&nbsp;trying&nbsp;<br>to possess the item&nbsp;more than we did before.&nbsp;<br>
As simple as the kernel of the theory seems, its shoots and roots curl extensively&nbsp;<br>through much of the social environment. From&nbsp;the garden of young love to&nbsp;<br>

the jungle of&nbsp;armed revolution to the fruits of the marketplace, impressive amounts of&nbsp;<br>our behavior can be explained by examining the tendrils of psychological reactance.&nbsp;<br>Before beginning such an examination, though,&nbsp;it would be helpful to determine when&nbsp;<br>people first show the desire&nbsp;to fight against restrictions of their freedoms.&nbsp;<br>
Child psychologists have&nbsp;traced the tendency&nbsp;back to the age of 2—a time identified as&nbsp;<br>a problem&nbsp;by parents&nbsp;<b>and&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>widely known to them&nbsp;as &quot;the&nbsp;terrible twos.&quot; Most parents&nbsp;<br>attest to seeing more contrary behavior in&nbsp;their children around&nbsp;this period. Two-year-<br>olds seem&nbsp;masters of the art of resistance&nbsp;to outside pressure, especially from their&nbsp;<br>parents. Tell them&nbsp;one thing, they do the opposite; give them&nbsp;one toy, they want&nbsp;<br>another;&nbsp;pick&nbsp;them&nbsp;up against their will, they wriggle and squirm&nbsp;to be put down; put&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;down agains: their&nbsp;will, they&nbsp;claw and struggle to be carried.&nbsp;<br>
One Virginia-based study nicely captured&nbsp;the style of&nbsp;terrible twos&nbsp;among boys who&nbsp;<br>averaged 24 months in age (S. S. Brehm&nbsp;&amp; Weintraub, 1977). The boys accompanied&nbsp;<br>their mothers into a room&nbsp;containing&nbsp;two equally attractive toys. The toys were always&nbsp;<br>arranged so that one stood next to a transparent Plexiglas barrier and the other stood&nbsp;<br>behind the barrier. For some of the boys, the Plexiglas sheet was only a foot high—<br>forming no real barrier to the toy behind it,&nbsp;since the boys could&nbsp;easily reach over the&nbsp;<br>top. For the other boys, however, the Plexiglas was 2 feet high, effectively blocking&nbsp;<br>their access to one toy unless they went around the barrier. The researchers wanted to&nbsp;<br>see how quickly the toddlers would make contact with the toys&nbsp;under these conditions.&nbsp;<br>Their findings were clear. When the barrier&nbsp;was too short to restrict access to the toy&nbsp;<br>behind it, the boys showed no special preference&nbsp;for either of the toys; on the average,&nbsp;<br>the toy next to the barrier was touched just&nbsp;as quickly&nbsp;as the one&nbsp;behind it. When the&nbsp;<br>barrier was high enough to be a true obstacle, however, the boys went directly to the&nbsp;<br>obstructed toy, making contact with it three times faster than&nbsp;with the unobstructed toy.&nbsp;<br>In all, the boys in this study demonstrated the classic&nbsp;terrible-twos response to a&nbsp;<br>limitation of&nbsp;their freedom: outright defiance.2&nbsp;<br>
Why should psychological reactance emerge at the age of 2?&nbsp;Perhaps the answer has to&nbsp;<br>do with a crucial change that most children&nbsp;go through about this time. It is then that&nbsp;<br>they first come&nbsp;to a recognition of themselves as individuals. No longer do they view&nbsp;<br>themselves as mere extensions of the social milieu but rather as identifiable, singular,&nbsp;<br>and separate beings (Levine, 1983;&nbsp;Lewis &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 1979; Mahler. Pine, &amp;&nbsp;<br>Bergman, 1975). This developing concept of&nbsp;autonomy brings naturally with it the&nbsp;<br>concept of freedom. An independent being&nbsp;is one with choices; a&nbsp;child with&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>newfound realization that he or she is such&nbsp;a being will want to explore the length and&nbsp;<br>breadth of the options. Perhaps&nbsp;we should be neither surprised&nbsp;<br>
2&nbsp;Two-year-old girls in this study did not show&nbsp;the same&nbsp;resistant response to the large&nbsp;<br>barrier as did the boys. Another study suggested this to be the case not because girls&nbsp;<br>don't oppose attempts to limit their freedoms. Instead, it appears that&nbsp;they are primarily&nbsp;<br>reactant to restrictions that&nbsp;come&nbsp;from&nbsp;other persons rather&nbsp;than from&nbsp;physical barriers&nbsp;<br>(S. S. Brehm, 1981).&nbsp;<br>

nor distressed, then, when our 2-year-olds strain incessantly against our will. They have&nbsp;<br>come to a recent and exhilarating&nbsp;perspective of themselves: they are freestanding&nbsp;<br>human entities. Vital questions&nbsp;of choice, rights, and control now need to be asked and&nbsp;<br>answered within their small minds. The tendency to fight for every liberty and against&nbsp;<br>every restriction might be best understood, then, as a quest for information. By testing&nbsp;<br>severely the limits of their&nbsp;freedoms&nbsp;(and, coincidentally, the patience of their parents),&nbsp;<br>the children&nbsp;are discovering where in their worlds they can&nbsp;expect&nbsp;to be controlled and&nbsp;<br>where to be&nbsp;in control. As we will see later,&nbsp;it is the wise parent who provides highly&nbsp;<br>consistent information.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Adult Reactance: Love, Guns, and Suds</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Although the terrible twos may be the most&nbsp;noticeable age of psychological reactance,&nbsp;<br>we show the strong tendency&nbsp;to react against restrictions on our&nbsp;freedoms of action&nbsp;<br>throughout our lives. One other age does stand out, however, as a time when this&nbsp;<br>tendency takes an especially&nbsp;rebellious&nbsp;form:&nbsp;the teenage years.&nbsp;An enlightened&nbsp;<br>neighbor once advised me, &quot;If you really want&nbsp;to get something done, you've got three&nbsp;<br>options: do it yourself, pay top dollar, or forbid your teenagers to do it.&quot; Like the twos,&nbsp;<br>this period&nbsp;is characterized by an&nbsp;emerging&nbsp;sense of individuality. For teenagers, the&nbsp;<br>emergence is out of the role&nbsp;of&nbsp;child, with&nbsp;all of&nbsp;its attendant parental&nbsp;control, and&nbsp;<br>toward the role of&nbsp;adult, with all of&nbsp;its&nbsp;attendant rights and duties. Not surprisingly,&nbsp;<br>adolescents tend to focus less on the duties than&nbsp;on the rights they feel&nbsp;they have as&nbsp;<br>young adults. Not surprisingly, again, imposing traditional parental authority at these&nbsp;<br>times is often counterproductive; teenagers will&nbsp;sneak, scheme, and fight to resist such&nbsp;<br>attempts at control.&nbsp;<br>
Nothing illustrates the boomerang quality of&nbsp;parental&nbsp;pressure on adolescent behavior&nbsp;<br>quite so clearly as a phenomenon known as the &quot;Romeo and Juliet effect.&quot; As we know,&nbsp;<br>Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet were the ill-fated Shakespearean characters&nbsp;whose&nbsp;<br>love was doomed by a feud between&nbsp;their families.&nbsp;Defying all parental&nbsp;attempts to keep&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;apart, the teenagers won a lasting union&nbsp;in their tragic act of&nbsp;twin suicide, an&nbsp;<br>ultimate assertion of&nbsp;free will.&nbsp;<br>
The intensity of the couple's feelings and actions has always been a source of&nbsp;<br>wonderment&nbsp;and puzzlement to observers of the play. How could such inordinate&nbsp;<br>devotion develop so quickly in a pair so&nbsp;young?&nbsp;A romantic might suggest rare and&nbsp;<br>perfect love. A social scientist, though, might point to the role of parental interference&nbsp;<br>and the psychological reactance it can produce. Perhaps the passion of Romeo and Juliet&nbsp;<br>was not initially so consuming that it transcended the extensive barriers erected by the&nbsp;<br>families. Perhaps, instead, it was fueled to&nbsp;a white heat by the placement of&nbsp;those&nbsp;<br>barriers. Could it be that&nbsp;had the youngsters been left&nbsp;to their own devices, their&nbsp;<br>inflamed devotion would have amounted&nbsp;to no more than a flicker of puppy love?&nbsp;<br>
Because the story is a work of fiction, such&nbsp;questions are, of course, hypothetical and&nbsp;<br>any answer to them&nbsp;speculative. However,&nbsp;it is possible to ask and answer with more&nbsp;<br>certainty similar questions about&nbsp;modern-day Romeos and Juliets.&nbsp;<br>

Do couples suffering parental interference&nbsp;react by committing themselves more firmly&nbsp;<br>to the partnership and falling more deeply&nbsp;in love?&nbsp;According to&nbsp;a study done with 140&nbsp;<br>Colorado teenage couples, that is exactly what they do. The researchers in this study&nbsp;<br>found that although parental interference&nbsp;was linked to some problems in the&nbsp;<br>relationship—the&nbsp;partners&nbsp;viewed one another more critically and reported a greater&nbsp;<br>number of negative behaviors&nbsp;in&nbsp;the other—that interference also made the pair feel&nbsp;<br>greater love for each other and desire for marriage. During&nbsp;the course of the study, as&nbsp;<br>parental interference intensified, so&nbsp;did the love experience. When the interference&nbsp;<br>weakened, romantic feelings&nbsp;actually cooled (Driscoll, Davis, &amp; Lipetz, 1972).3&nbsp;<br>

Last Christmas&nbsp;I met a 27-year-old man. I&nbsp;was 19. Although he really wasn't&nbsp;my type, I&nbsp;<br>went out with him—probably because it was a status thing to date an older man— but I&nbsp;<br>really didn't become&nbsp;interested in him&nbsp;until&nbsp;my&nbsp;folks expressed their concern about his&nbsp;<br>age. The more they got on my case&nbsp;about it,&nbsp;the more in love I became. It only lasted&nbsp;<br>five months, but this was about four months&nbsp;longer than it would have lasted if my&nbsp;<br>parents hadn't&nbsp;said anything.&nbsp;<br>

For twos and teens, then, psychological reactance flows across the broad surface of&nbsp;<br>experience, always turbulent and&nbsp;forceful. For most of the rest&nbsp;of us, the pool&nbsp;of reactant&nbsp;<br>energy lies quiet and covered, erupting geyserlike only on occasion (Ruback &amp; Juieng,&nbsp;<br>1997).

In providing such direction, parents&nbsp;<br>should recognize that teenagers,&nbsp;who see themselves as young adults, will not respond&nbsp;<br>well to control attempts that are typical of&nbsp;parent-child relationships. Especially in the&nbsp;<br>clearly adult arena of mating,&nbsp;adult tools of influence (preference and persuasion) will&nbsp;<br>be more effective than&nbsp;traditional forms of parental control (prohibitions and&nbsp;<br>punishments).

fascinating ways that are of interest not only to&nbsp;the&nbsp;student&nbsp;of&nbsp;human behavior but to&nbsp;<br>lawmakers and policymakers as well&nbsp;<br>
Foe instance, there's the odd case of Kennesaw, Georgia, the town&nbsp;that enacted a law&nbsp;<br>requiring every adult resident to own a gun and ammunition, under penalty of six&nbsp;<br>months in jail and a $200 fine. A]l the features of the Kennesaw gun law make it a&nbsp;<br>prime target for psychological reactance. The freedom that the law restricts is&nbsp;an&nbsp;<br>important, longstanding one to which most American citizens feel entitled.&nbsp;Furthermore,&nbsp;<br>the law was passed by the Kennesaw City Council with a minimum of public input.&nbsp;<br>Reactance theory would predict that under these circumstances few of the adults in the&nbsp;<br>town of 5.400 would obey. Yet,&nbsp;the newspaper reports testified that three to four weeks&nbsp;<br>after passage of the law,&nbsp;firearms&nbsp;sales in Kennesaw were—no pun intended—booming.&nbsp;<br>
How are we to make sense of this apparent&nbsp;contradiction of the reactance principle?&nbsp;The&nbsp;<br>answer is by looking a bit closer at those who were buying Kennesaw's guns. Interviews&nbsp;<br>with Kennesaw store owners revealed that the&nbsp;gun buyers were not town&nbsp;residents at all,&nbsp;<br>but visitors, many of them lured by publicity to purchase their initial guns in Kennesaw.&nbsp;<br>Donna Green, proprietor of a shop described in one newspaper article as a virtual&nbsp;<br>&quot;grocery store of firearms,&quot; summed it up:&nbsp;&quot;Business is great.&nbsp;But they're almost all&nbsp;<br>being bought up by people from&nbsp;out of town.&nbsp;We've only had two or three local people&nbsp;<br>buy a gun to comply with the&nbsp;law.&quot; After passage of the law, then, gun buying had&nbsp;<br>become&nbsp;a frequent activity in Kennesaw, but&nbsp;not among those it was intended to cover;&nbsp;<br>they were massively noncompliant. Only those individuals whose freedom&nbsp;in the matter&nbsp;<br>had not been&nbsp;restricted by&nbsp;the law had the inclination to live by&nbsp;it.&nbsp;<br>
A similar situation arose a decade earlier&nbsp;several hundred miles south of Kennesaw,&nbsp;<br>when, to protect the environment, Dade&nbsp;County (Miami), Florida, imposed an&nbsp;<br>antiphosphate ordinance prohibiting the use—and possession!—of laundry or cleaning&nbsp;<br>products containing phosphates.&nbsp;A study done to determine the&nbsp;social impact of the law&nbsp;<br>discovered two parallel reactions on the part of&nbsp;Miami residents. First, in what seems a&nbsp;<br>Florida tradition, many Miarnians turned&nbsp;to smuggling. Sometimes with neighbors and&nbsp;<br>friends in large &quot;soap caravans,&quot; they drove to nearby counties to load up on phosphate&nbsp;<br>detergents. Hoarding quickly developed and, in&nbsp;the rush of obsession that frequently&nbsp;<br>characterizes hoarders,&nbsp;families&nbsp;boasted of having 20-year supplies&nbsp;of phosphate&nbsp;<br>cleaners.&nbsp;<br>
The second reaction to the law was more subtle and more general than the deliberate&nbsp;<br>defiance of the smugglers and hoarders. Spurred by the tendency to want what they&nbsp;<br>could no longer have, the majority of Miami consumers came to see phosphate cleaners&nbsp;<br>as better products than before. Compared to&nbsp;Tampa residents, who were not affected by&nbsp;<br>the Dade County ordinance, the citizens of&nbsp;Miami rated phosphate&nbsp;detergents gentler,&nbsp;<br>more effective in cold&nbsp;water, better&nbsp;whiteners and fresheners,&nbsp;and more powerful on&nbsp;<br>stains. After passage of the law, they&nbsp;had even come&nbsp;to believe that phosphate&nbsp;<br>detergents poured more easily (Mazis, 1975; Mazis, Settle, &amp; Leslie, 1973).&nbsp;<br>

This sort of response is typical of individuals&nbsp;who have lost an established freedom;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<br>recognizing that it&nbsp;is typical is crucial to understanding how psychological reactance&nbsp;<br>and the principle of scarcity work. When&nbsp;something becomes less available our freedom&nbsp;<br>to have it is limited, and we experience an increased desire for it. We rarely recognize,&nbsp;<br>however, that psychological reactance has caused&nbsp;us to want the item&nbsp;more; all we know&nbsp;<br>is that&nbsp;we&nbsp;<i>want&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>it. To make sense of our heightened&nbsp;desire for the item, we begin to&nbsp;<br>assign it positive qualities. In&nbsp;the case of the Dade County antiphosphate law—and in&nbsp;<br>other instances of newly restricted availability— assuming a cause-and-effect&nbsp;<br>relationship between desire and merit is a faulty supposition. Phosphate detergents&nbsp;<br>clean, whiten, and pour no better after they are banned than they do before. We&nbsp;just&nbsp;<br>assume they do because we find that we desire them&nbsp;more.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Censorship</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
The tendency to want what has been banned, and, therefore, to presume that it is more&nbsp;<br>worthwhile is not limited to commodities such as laundry soap; it also extends to&nbsp;<br>restrictions on information. In an age when&nbsp;the ability to acquire, store, and manage&nbsp;<br>information increasingly affects access to&nbsp;wealth and power, it is important to&nbsp;<br>understand how we typically react to attempts to censor&nbsp;or otherwise constrain our&nbsp;<br>access to information. Although much&nbsp;data exist concerning our reactions to observing&nbsp;<br>various kinds of potentially censorable material—media&nbsp;violence, pornography, radical&nbsp;<br>political&nbsp;rhetoric—there&nbsp;is surprisingly little evidence on&nbsp;our reactions to the censoring&nbsp;<br>of this material. Fortunately, the results of&nbsp;the few studies that have been done on&nbsp;<br>censorship are highly consistent. Almost invariably, our response to banned information&nbsp;<br>is to want&nbsp;to&nbsp;receive that information to a&nbsp;greater extent&nbsp;and to become&nbsp;more favorable&nbsp;<br>toward it than we were before the ban. (Ashmore, Ramchandra, &amp; Jones, 1971;&nbsp;<br>Wicklund &amp; Brehm,&nbsp;1974; Worchel &amp; Arnold,&nbsp;1973; Worchel, Arnold, &amp; Baker, 1975;&nbsp;<br>Worchel, 1992).&nbsp;<br>
The intriguing finding about the&nbsp;effects of censored information on an audience is not&nbsp;<br>that audience members want to&nbsp;have the&nbsp;information more than&nbsp;before; that&nbsp;seems&nbsp;<br>natural. Rather, it is that they come to believe in the information more, even though they&nbsp;<br>haven't received it. For example, when University of North Carolina students learned&nbsp;<br>that a speech opposing coed dorms on campus would be banned, they became more&nbsp;<br>opposed to the idea of coed dorms (Worchel, Arnold, &amp; Baker, 1975). Thus, without&nbsp;<br>ever hearing&nbsp;the speech,&nbsp;the students became more sympathetic to its argument. This&nbsp;<br>raises the worrisome possibility that&nbsp;especially clever individuals holding a weak or&nbsp;<br>unpopular position on an issue can get us to&nbsp;agree with that position by&nbsp;arranging to&nbsp;<br>have their message restricted. The irony is&nbsp;that for such people—members of fringe&nbsp;<br>political groups, for example—the most effective strategy may not be to publicize their&nbsp;<br>unpopular views but to get those views officially censored and then to publicize the&nbsp;<br>censorship. Perhaps the authors of this country's Constitution were acting as much as&nbsp;<br>sophisticated social psychologists as staunch civil libertarians when&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

they wrote the remarkably permissive free&nbsp;speech provision of the First Amendment.&nbsp;By&nbsp;<br>refusing to re&amp;train freedom of speech, they&nbsp;may have been trying to minimize&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>chance that new political notions would&nbsp;win support via the irrational course of&nbsp;<br>psychological reactance.4&nbsp;<br>
Of course, political ideas are&nbsp;not the only kind&nbsp;that are susceptible to restriction. Access&nbsp;<br>to sexually oriented material is also frequently limited. Although not as sensational as&nbsp;<br>the occasional police crackdown on &quot;adult&quot; bookstores and theaters, regular pressure is&nbsp;<br>applied by parents and citizens groups to censor the sexual content of educational&nbsp;<br>material ranging from&nbsp;sex education and&nbsp;hygiene texts to school library books. Both&nbsp;<br>sides in the struggle seem&nbsp;to be well intentioned and the issues are not simple, as they&nbsp;<br>involve such matters as&nbsp;morality, art, parental control over the&nbsp;schools,&nbsp;and freedoms&nbsp;<br>guaranteed by the First Amendment. From&nbsp;a&nbsp;purely psychological point of view,&nbsp;<br>however, those favoring strict censorship may&nbsp;wish to examine closely the results of a&nbsp;<br>study done on Purdue University undergraduates (Zellinger, Fromkin. Speller,&nbsp;<i>&amp;&nbsp;</i>Kohn,&nbsp;<br>1974). In this study, students were shown some&nbsp;advertisements for a novel. For half the&nbsp;<br>students, the advertising copy&nbsp;included the statement &quot;a book&nbsp;for adults only, restricted&nbsp;<br>to those 21 years and over&quot;; the other half of&nbsp;the students read no such age restriction on&nbsp;<br>the book. When the researcher later asked the&nbsp;students to indicate their feelings toward&nbsp;<br>the book, they discovered the same&nbsp;pair of reactions we have noted with other bans:&nbsp;<br>Those who learned of the age restriction wanted to read the book more and believed that&nbsp;<br>they would&nbsp;like the book&nbsp;more than did&nbsp;those who thought their access to the book was&nbsp;<br>unlimited.&nbsp;<br>
It might be argued that, although these results may be true for a small sample&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>sexually inclined college students, they would&nbsp;not apply to students in&nbsp;junior and senior&nbsp;<br>high schools, where the sex curricula battles are actually being waged. Two factors&nbsp;<br>make me&nbsp;doubt such an argument. First,&nbsp;developmental psychologists report that the&nbsp;<br>desire to oppose adult&nbsp;control generally begins quite early in adolescence, around the&nbsp;<br>start of the teenage years. Nonscientific observers have also&nbsp;noted the early rise of these&nbsp;<br>strong oppositional tendencies. Shakespeare, scholars tell us,&nbsp;placed Romeo and Juliet&nbsp;<br>at the ages of 15 and 13 years, respectively. Second, the pattern of reactions exhibited&nbsp;<br>by the Purdue students is not unique to the topic of sex and thus can't be attributed to&nbsp;<br>any great preoccupation with sex that&nbsp;college students may have (Bushman&nbsp;<i>&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Stack,&nbsp;<br>1996). In fact, the pattern is common to externally imposed restrictions in general.&nbsp;<br>Limiting access to the book had the same&nbsp;effects as did banning phosphate detergents in&nbsp;<br>Florida or&nbsp;censoring&nbsp;a speech in North Carolina: The people involved wanted the&nbsp;<br>restricted item more and, as a result, felt more favorable toward it.&nbsp;<br>
Those who support the official banning of&nbsp;sexually relevant materials from&nbsp;school&nbsp;<br>curricula have the avowed goal of reducing the orientation of the society, es-&nbsp;<br>
4Evidence that reactance can cause people to&nbsp;take political action they would otherwise&nbsp;<br>not have taken comes from&nbsp;a study by Heilman (1976). Supermarket shoppers were&nbsp;<br>most likely&nbsp;to sign a&nbsp;petition favoring federal price controls&nbsp;after they had been&nbsp;<br>informed that a federal official had&nbsp;opposed the distribution of the petition.&nbsp;<br>

pecially of its youth, toward eroticism. In&nbsp;the light of the Purdue study and in the&nbsp;<br>context of other research on&nbsp;the effects of imposed&nbsp;restraints, one must wonder whether&nbsp;<br>official censorship as a means may not be antithetical to the goal. If&nbsp;we are to believe&nbsp;<br>the implications of the research, then censorship is likely to increase the desire&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>students for sexual material and, consequently,&nbsp;to cause them&nbsp;to view themselves as the&nbsp;<br>kind of individuals who like such material.&nbsp;<br>
The term&nbsp;<i>official censorship&nbsp;</i>usually makes us think of bans on political or sexually&nbsp;<br>explicit material, yet there is another common&nbsp;sort of official censorship that we don't&nbsp;<br>think of in the same&nbsp;way, probably because it occurs after the&nbsp;fact. Often in a jury trial,&nbsp;<br>a piece of evidence or testimony will be introduced, only to be ruled inadmissible by the&nbsp;<br>presiding judge, who may then&nbsp;admonish the jurors&nbsp;to disregard&nbsp;that evidence.&nbsp;From&nbsp;<br>this perspective, the judge may be viewed as a censor, though the form&nbsp;of the censorship&nbsp;<br>is odd. The presentation of the information to&nbsp;the jury is not banned—too late for that—<br>it's the jury's&nbsp;use of&nbsp;the information that is&nbsp;banned. How effective are such instructions&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;a judge?&nbsp;Is it possible that, for jury members who feel it is their right to consider&nbsp;<br>all the available information, declarations&nbsp;of&nbsp;inad-missibility&nbsp;may actually cause&nbsp;<br>psychological reactance, leading&nbsp;the jurors to use the evidence to a greater extent?&nbsp;<br>
These were some&nbsp;of the questions asked in&nbsp;a large-scale jury research project conducted&nbsp;<br>by the University of Chicago Law School (Broeder, 1959). One reason the results of the&nbsp;<br>Chicago jury&nbsp;project are&nbsp;informative is that&nbsp;the participants were individuals who were&nbsp;<br>actually on jury duty at the time and who agreed&nbsp;to be members of &quot;experimental juries&quot;&nbsp;<br>formed by the researchers. These experimental&nbsp;juries then heard tapes of&nbsp;evidence from&nbsp;<br>previous trials and deliberated as if they&nbsp;were deciding the case. In the study most&nbsp;<br>relevant to our interest in official censorship, 30&nbsp;such juries heard the case of a woman&nbsp;<br>who was injured by a car driven&nbsp;by&nbsp;a careless male defendant. The first finding of the&nbsp;<br>study was no surprise: When the driver said&nbsp;he had liability insurance, the jurors&nbsp;<br>awarded his victim&nbsp;an average of $4,000 more&nbsp;than when he said he had no insurance&nbsp;<br>($37,000 versus $33,000). Thus, as insurance&nbsp;companies have long suspected, juries&nbsp;<br>make larger awards to victims if an insurance company will have to pay. The second&nbsp;<br>finding of the study is the fascinating one,&nbsp;though. If the driver said he was insured&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;<br></i>the judge ruled that evidence inadmissible (directing the jury to disregard it), the&nbsp;<br>instruction to disregard had a boomerang&nbsp;effect, causing an average award of $46,000.&nbsp;<br>So, when certain juries learned&nbsp;that the driver was insured,&nbsp;they increased the damage&nbsp;<br>payment by $4,000. When other juries were told&nbsp;officially that they must disregard the&nbsp;<br>information, they used it still more, increasing the damage payment by $13,000. It&nbsp;<br>appears, then, that even&nbsp;the proper,&nbsp;official censorship of a courtroom&nbsp;setting creates&nbsp;<br>problems for the censor. We&nbsp;react to information restriction&nbsp;there, as we&nbsp;do in other&nbsp;<br>areas, by valuing the banned information more&nbsp;than ever (for additional evidence, see&nbsp;<br>Wolf&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Montgomery, 1977). The realization that we&nbsp;value limited information allows&nbsp;<br>us to apply the scarcity principle to realms beyond material commodities. The principle&nbsp;<br>works for messages,&nbsp;communications, and knowledge, too. Taking this perspective, we&nbsp;<br>can see that&nbsp;<br>

<i>information may not have to be censored for&nbsp;</i>MS&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>to value it more;&nbsp;it need only be&nbsp;<br>scarce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>According to the scarcity principle,&nbsp;we&nbsp;will find a&nbsp;piece of information more&nbsp;<br>persuasive if we think that we can't get it elsewhere. This idea—that exclusive&nbsp;<br>information is mare persuasive information—is central to the thinking of two&nbsp;<br>psychologists, Timothy Brock and Howard Fromkin, who have developed a&nbsp;<br>&quot;commodity theory&quot; analysis of persuasion (Brock, 1968; Fromkin &amp; Brock, 1971).&nbsp;<br>
The strongest support I know for Brock and Fromkin's theory comes from&nbsp;a small&nbsp;<br>experiment done by a student of mine (Knishinsky, 1982). At the time, the student was&nbsp;<br>also a successful businessman, the owner of a beef-importing company, who had&nbsp;<br>returned to school to get advanced training&nbsp;in marketing. After we talked in my office&nbsp;<br>one day about scarcity and exclusivity of information, he decided&nbsp;to do a study using his&nbsp;<br>sales staff. The company's customers—buyers&nbsp;for supermarkets and other retail food&nbsp;<br>outlets—were called on the phone&nbsp;as usual by a salesperson and asked for a purchase in&nbsp;<br>one of three ways. One set of customers heard a standard sales presentation before being&nbsp;<br>asked for their orders. Another set of customers heard the&nbsp;standard sales presentation&nbsp;<br>plus information that the supply of imported beef was likely to be scarce in the&nbsp;<br>upcoming months. A third group received&nbsp;the standard&nbsp;sales presentation and&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>information about a scarce supply of beef, too; however, they also learned that the&nbsp;<br>scarce supply news was&nbsp;not generally available information—it had come, they were&nbsp;<br>told, from&nbsp;certain exclusive contacts that the company had.5&nbsp;Thus, the customers who&nbsp;<br>received this last sales presentation&nbsp;learned that&nbsp;not only was the availability of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>product limited, so too was the news concerning it—the scarcity double-whammy.&nbsp;<br>
The results&nbsp;of the experiment quickly became apparent when the company salespeople&nbsp;<br>began to urge&nbsp;the owner to buy more beef&nbsp;because there wasn't&nbsp;enough in the inventory&nbsp;<br>to keep up with all the orders they were&nbsp;receiving. Compared to&nbsp;the customers who got&nbsp;<br>only the standard sales appeal, those who were also told about the&nbsp;future scarcity of&nbsp;beef&nbsp;<br>bought more&nbsp;than twice as much. The real boost in sales, however, occurred among the&nbsp;<br>customers who heard of the impending scarcity via &quot;exclusive&quot; information. They&nbsp;<br>purchased six times the amount&nbsp;that the customers who received only the standard sales&nbsp;<br>pitch did. Apparently, the fact that the news&nbsp;about the scarcity information was itself&nbsp;<br>scarce made&nbsp;it especially persuasive.&nbsp;<br>
<b>OPTIMAL CONDITIONS_______________________________</b>&nbsp;<br>
Much like the other effective weapons of influence, the scarcity principle is&nbsp;more&nbsp;<br>effective at some times than at others. An important practical defense, then, is to find&nbsp;<br>out when scarcity works best on us. A great&nbsp;deal can be learned from&nbsp;an experiment&nbsp;<br>
5For ethical reasons, the information provided&nbsp;to the customers was always true. There&nbsp;<br><i>was&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>an impending foreign beef shortage and&nbsp;this news had, indeed, come&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<br>company through its exclusive sources.&nbsp;<br>

devised by social psychologist Stephen Worchel and his colleagues (Worchel,&nbsp;Lee,&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<br>Adewole, 1975). The basic procedure used&nbsp;by Worchel and his research team&nbsp;was&nbsp;<br>simple: Participants in a consumer preference study were given a chocolate chip cookie&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;a jar and asked to taste and rate its&nbsp;quality.&nbsp;For half&nbsp;of&nbsp;the raters, the jar contained&nbsp;<br>ten cookies; for the other half, it contained&nbsp;just two. As we might expect from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>scarcity principle, when the cookie was one of only two available, it was rated more&nbsp;<br>favorably than when it was one of ten. The&nbsp;cookie in short supply&nbsp;was rated as more&nbsp;<br>desirable to eat in the future, more attractive as a consumer item,&nbsp;and more costly than&nbsp;<br>the identical cookie&nbsp;in abundant supply.&nbsp;<br>
Although this pattern of results provides a rather striking&nbsp;validation of the scarcity&nbsp;<br>principle, it doesn't&nbsp;tell us anything we&nbsp;don't already know. Once again, we see that a&nbsp;<br>less available item&nbsp;is more desired and valued. The real worth of the cookie study comes&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;two additional findings. Let's take them&nbsp;one at a&nbsp;time, as each deserves thorough&nbsp;<br>consideration.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>New Scarcity: Costlier Cookies and Civil Conflict</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
The first of these noteworthy results involved&nbsp;a small variation in the experiment's basic&nbsp;<br>procedure. Rather than&nbsp;rating the cookies under conditions of constant&nbsp;scarcity, some&nbsp;<br>participants were first given ajar of ten cookies that was then replaced by ajar of two&nbsp;<br>cookies. Thus, before taking a bite, certain of&nbsp;the participants saw their abundant supply&nbsp;<br>of cookies reduced to a scarce supply. Other participants, however, knew only scarcity&nbsp;<br>of supply from&nbsp;the onset, as the number of cookies in their jars was left at two. With this&nbsp;<br>procedure, the researchers were seeking to answer a question about types of scarcity: Do&nbsp;<br>we value more those things that have become&nbsp;recently less available to us or those&nbsp;<br>things that have always been&nbsp;scarce? In the cookie experiment, the answer was plain.&nbsp;<br>The drop from abundance to scarcity produced&nbsp;a decidedly more positive reaction to the&nbsp;<br>cookies than did constant scarcity.&nbsp;<br>
The idea that newly experienced scarcity is&nbsp;the&nbsp;more powerful kind applies&nbsp;to situations&nbsp;<br>well beyond the bounds of the cookie study. For example, social&nbsp;scientists have&nbsp;<br>determined that such scarcity is a&nbsp;primary cause of political turmoil and violence.&nbsp;<br>Perhaps the most prominent proponent of this argument is James C. Davies (1962,&nbsp;<br>1969) who states that we are most likely to&nbsp;find revolutions at a time when a period of&nbsp;<br>improving economic and social conditions&nbsp;is followed by a short, sharp reversal in&nbsp;those&nbsp;<br>conditions. Thus, it is not the traditionally&nbsp;most downtrodden people— those who have&nbsp;<br>come to see their deprivation as part of the natural order of things—who are especially&nbsp;<br>likely to revolt. Instead, revolutionaries are more likely to be those who have been given&nbsp;<br>at least some&nbsp;taste of a better life. When the economic and social improvements they&nbsp;<br>have experienced and come&nbsp;to expect suddenly become&nbsp;less available, they desire them&nbsp;<br>more than ever and often rise up violently to&nbsp;secure&nbsp;them. For instance, it is little&nbsp;<br>recognized that at the time&nbsp;of the American Revolution, the colonists had the highest&nbsp;<br>standard of living and the lowest taxes in&nbsp;the Western World. According to historian&nbsp;<br>Thomas Fleming (1997), it wasn't&nbsp;until the&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

<a name=230></a>220&nbsp;<i>Chapter 7</i>&nbsp;<br>
British sought a cut of&nbsp;this widespread prosperity (by levying&nbsp;taxes) that the Americans&nbsp;<br>revolted.&nbsp;<br>
Davies has gathered persuasive evidence&nbsp;for his novel thesis from&nbsp;a range of&nbsp;<br>revolutions, revolts, and internal wars, including the French, Russian, and Egyptian&nbsp;<br>revolutions,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;such domestic uprisings as Dorr's Rebellion&nbsp;in nineteenth-<br>century Rhode Island, the American Civil War, and the urban black riots of the 1960s.&nbsp;<br>In each case, a time of increasing well-being&nbsp;preceded a tight cluster of reversals that&nbsp;<br>burst into violence.&nbsp;<br>
The racial conflict in America's cities during the mid-1960s represents a case in point&nbsp;<br>that many of us can recall. At the time, it was not uncommon to&nbsp;hear the question, &quot;Why&nbsp;<br>now?&quot;&nbsp;It didn't seem&nbsp;to make sense that within&nbsp;their 300-year history, most of&nbsp;which&nbsp;<br>had been spent in servitude&nbsp;and much of the rest in privation, American blacks would&nbsp;<br>choose the socially progressive sixties as the time to revolt. Indeed, as Davies points&nbsp;<br>out, the two&nbsp;decades after the&nbsp;start of World War II had&nbsp;brought dramatic political and&nbsp;<br>economic gains to the black population. In 1940,&nbsp;blacks faced&nbsp;stringent&nbsp;legal restrictions&nbsp;<br>in such areas as housing, transportation and education; moreover, even when the&nbsp;<br>amount of education was the same, the average&nbsp;black family earned only a bit more than&nbsp;<br>half the amount its counterpart white family earned. Fifteen years later, much had&nbsp;<br>changed. Federal legislation had struck down as unacceptable formal and informal&nbsp;<br>attempts to&nbsp;segregate blacks in schools, public places, housing, and employment&nbsp;<br>settings. Economic advances had been made,&nbsp;too; black family income&nbsp;had risen from&nbsp;<br>56 to 80 percent of that of a comparably educated white family.&nbsp;<br>
Then, according to&nbsp;Davies'&nbsp;analysis&nbsp;of social&nbsp;conditions,&nbsp;this rapid progress was stymied&nbsp;<br>by events that soured the heady optimism&nbsp;of previous years.&nbsp;First, political and legal&nbsp;<br>change proved substantially easier&nbsp;to enact than social change. Despite all the&nbsp;<br>progressive legislation of the 1940s and 1950s, blacks perceived that most&nbsp;<br>neighborhoods, jobs, and schools remained segregated. Thus, the Washington-based&nbsp;<br>victories&nbsp;came&nbsp;to feel like defeats&nbsp;at home.&nbsp;For example, in the four years following&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>Supreme Court's 1954 decision to integrate all&nbsp;public schools, blacks&nbsp;were the targets of&nbsp;<br>530 acts of violence (direct intimidation of black children&nbsp;and parents, bombings and&nbsp;<br>burnings) designed to prevent school integration. This violence generated the perception&nbsp;<br>of another sort of setback in black progress.&nbsp;For&nbsp;the first time since well before World&nbsp;<br>War II, when lynchings had occurred at an average rate of 78 per year,&nbsp;blacks had to be&nbsp;<br>concerned&nbsp;about the basic safety&nbsp;of their families. The new violence was not limited&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>the education issue, either. Peaceful civil rights demonstrations of&nbsp;the time were&nbsp;<br>frequently confronted by hostile crowds—and police.&nbsp;<br>
Still another type of downturn occurred within the black populace in economic progress.&nbsp;<br>In 1962, the income&nbsp;of a black family had slid back to 74 percent of that of a similarly&nbsp;<br>educated&nbsp;white family. By Davies's argument, the most illuminating aspect of&nbsp;this 74&nbsp;<br>percent figure is not that it&nbsp;represented a long-term&nbsp;increase in prosperity from&nbsp;prewar&nbsp;<br>levels, but that it represented a short-term&nbsp;decline from the flush levels of the mid-<br>1950s. In 1963 came the Birmingham&nbsp;riots and, in staccato suc-&nbsp;<br>

cession, scores of violent demonstrations, building toward the major upheavals of&nbsp;<br>
Watts, Newark, and Detroit.&nbsp;<br>
In keeping with a distinct&nbsp;historical pattern of revolution, blacks in the United&nbsp;<br>
States&nbsp;were more rebellious when their prolonged progress was somewhat curtailed&nbsp;than&nbsp;<br>they were before it began. This pattern offers a valuable lesson&nbsp;for would-be rulers:&nbsp;<br>When it comes to freedoms, it is more dangerous&nbsp;to have given for a while than never to&nbsp;<br>have given at all. The problem&nbsp;for a&nbsp;government that seeks to improve the political and&nbsp;<br>economic status of a traditionally oppressed&nbsp;group is that, in so doing, it establishes&nbsp;<br>freedoms for the group&nbsp;where none existed before. Should these now&nbsp;<i>established&nbsp;<br></i>freedoms become less available, there will be&nbsp;an especially hot variety of&nbsp;hell to pay.&nbsp;<br>
We can look&nbsp;to more recent events&nbsp;in the former Soviet Union for evidence that this&nbsp;<br>basic rule still holds. After decades&nbsp;of repression, Mikhail Gorbachev began granting&nbsp;<br>the Soviet populace new liberties,&nbsp;privileges,&nbsp;and choices via the twin polices of&nbsp;<br><i>glasnost&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>perestroika.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Alarmed by the direction their nation was taking, a small&nbsp;<br>group of government, military, and KGB officials staged&nbsp;a coup, placing Gorbachev&nbsp;<br>under house arrest and announcing on August&nbsp;19, 1991, that they had assumed power&nbsp;<br>and were moving to reinstate the old order. Most of&nbsp;the world imagined that the Soviet&nbsp;<br>people, known for their characteristic&nbsp;acquiescence to subjugation, would passively&nbsp;<br>yield as they had always done.&nbsp;<i>Time&nbsp;</i>magazine editor, Lance Morrow, described his own&nbsp;<br>reaction similarly: &quot;At first the coup seemed to confirm the norm.&nbsp;The news&nbsp;<br>administered a dark shock, followed immediately by a depressed sense of resignation:&nbsp;<br>of course, of course, the Russians must revert to their essential selves, to their own&nbsp;<br>history. Gorbachev and&nbsp;<i>glasnost&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>were an&nbsp;aberration;&nbsp;now we are back to&nbsp;fatal&nbsp;<br>normality&quot; (1991).&nbsp;<br>
But these were not to be normal times. For one thing, Gorbachev had not governed in&nbsp;<br>the tradition&nbsp;of the czars or Stalin or any&nbsp;of the line of oppressive&nbsp;post-War rulers who&nbsp;<br>had not allowed even a breath of freedom&nbsp;to the masses. He had ceded them certain&nbsp;<br>rights and choices. And when these now established freedoms were threatened, the&nbsp;<br>people lashed out the way a dog would if someone tried taking a fresh bone from its&nbsp;<br>mouth. Within hours of the junta's announcement,&nbsp;thousands were in the streets erecting&nbsp;<br>barricades, confronting armed troops, surrounding tanks, and defying curfews. The&nbsp;<br>uprising was so swift, so massive, so unitary&nbsp;in its opposition to any retreat from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>gains of&nbsp;<i>glasnost&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>that after only three riotous days,&nbsp;the astonished officials relented,&nbsp;<br>surrendering their power and&nbsp;pleading for mercy from&nbsp;Chairman Gorbachev. Had they&nbsp;<br>been students of history—or of psychology—the&nbsp;failed plotters would not have been so&nbsp;<br>surprised by the tidal wave of popular resistance that swallowed their coup. From the&nbsp;<br>vantage point of either discipline, they could have learned an invariant lesson: Freedoms&nbsp;<br>once granted will not be&nbsp;relinquished without a fight.&nbsp;<br>
The lesson applies to the politics of&nbsp;family&nbsp;as well as country. The parent who grants&nbsp;<br>privileges&nbsp;or&nbsp;enforces&nbsp;rules erratically invites rebellion by unwittingly establishing&nbsp;<br>freedoms for the child. The parent who only sometimes prohibits between-meal sweets&nbsp;<br>may create for the child the freedom&nbsp;to&nbsp;have such snacks. At that point,&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=232></a><IMG src="pdf-232_1.jpg"><br>
<b>222&nbsp;</b><i>Chapter 7</i>&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
enforcing the rule becomes a much more difficult and explosive matter because the&nbsp;<br>child is no longer merely lacking a never-possessed right but is losing an established&nbsp;<br>one. As we have seen in the&nbsp;case of political freedoms and&nbsp;(especially&nbsp;pertinent to the&nbsp;<br>present discussion) chocolate chip cookies, people see a thing as more desirable when it&nbsp;<br>recently has become&nbsp;less available than when&nbsp;it has been scarce all along. We should&nbsp;<br>not be surprised, then, that&nbsp;research shows that parents who enforce and discipline&nbsp;<br>inconsistently produce generally rebellious children (Lytton, 1979; O'Leary, 1995).6&nbsp;<br>
^o avoid this problem,&nbsp;parents needn't be&nbsp;severe or unduly rigid rulekeepers. For&nbsp;<br>example, a child who unavoidably misses lunch can be given a before-dinner snack&nbsp;<br>because this would not violate the normal rule against such&nbsp;snacks and, consequently,&nbsp;<br>would not establish a general freedom. The difficulty conies when&nbsp;the child&nbsp;is&nbsp;<br>capriciously allowed a treat on some&nbsp;days&nbsp;but not on others and can see no good reason&nbsp;<br>for the difference. It is this arbitrary&nbsp;approach that can build perceived freedoms and&nbsp;<br>provoke rebellion.&nbsp;<br>

<b>READER'S&nbsp;REPORT 7.2</b>&nbsp;<br>
<b>From a New&nbsp;York Investment&nbsp;Manager</b>&nbsp;<br>
I recently read a story in the&nbsp;<i>Wall Street Journal&nbsp;</i>that&nbsp;illustrates the scarcity principle&nbsp;<br>and how people want whatever&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>taken away from&nbsp;them. The article described how&nbsp;<br>Procter&nbsp;<i>&amp;&nbsp;</i>Gamble tried an experiment in upstate&nbsp;New York by eliminating all savings&nbsp;<br>coupons for their products and replacing the coupons with lower everyday prices. This&nbsp;<br>produced a big consumer revolt—with boycotts, and protests, and a firestorm of&nbsp;<br>complaints—even though Procter &amp; Gamble's&nbsp;data showed that only 2 percent of&nbsp;<br>coupons are used and that, on average during the no-coupon experiment, consumers&nbsp;<br>paid the same&nbsp;for P&amp;G products with less inconvenience. According&nbsp;to the article, the&nbsp;<br>revolt happened because of something that&nbsp;P&amp;G didn't recognize: &quot;Coupons, to&nbsp;many&nbsp;<br>people, are practically an inalienable right.&quot; It is amazing how&nbsp;strongly people react&nbsp;<br>when you try to take things away, even if they never use them.&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Author's note:&nbsp;</b>Although Procter &amp; Gamble executives&nbsp;may have been perplexed by this&nbsp;<br>seemingly irrational consumer response, they&nbsp;inadvertently contributed to it. Discount&nbsp;<br>coupons have been part of the American scene for over a century, and P&amp;G had&nbsp;<br>actively &quot;couponed&quot; its products for decades,&nbsp;thereby helping to&nbsp;establish coupons as&nbsp;<br>something consumers had a right to expect. And it's always the long-established rights&nbsp;<br>that people fight most&nbsp;ferociously to preserve.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i><b>Competition&nbsp;for Scarce Resources: Foolish Fury</b></i>&nbsp;<br>
Let's look back to the cookie study for another&nbsp;insight into the way we&nbsp;react to scarcity.&nbsp;<br>We've already seen&nbsp;from&nbsp;the results of that&nbsp;study that scarce cookies were rated&nbsp;higher&nbsp;<br>than abundant cookies and that newly scarce&nbsp;cookies were rated higher still. Staying&nbsp;<br>with the newly scarce cookies now, we find that&nbsp;certain cookies were the highest rated&nbsp;<br>of all—those that became&nbsp;less available because of a demand for them. Remember that&nbsp;<br>in the experiment the participants&nbsp;who experienced new scarcity had been given a jar of&nbsp;<br>ten cookies that was then replaced with&nbsp;a jar of only two cookies. Actually, the&nbsp;<br>researchers created this scarcity in one of&nbsp;two ways. Certain&nbsp;participants&nbsp;were told that&nbsp;<br>some of their cookies had to be&nbsp;given away to other raters&nbsp;in order to supply the demand&nbsp;<br>for cookies in the study. Another set of participants was told that the number of their&nbsp;<br>cookies had to be reduced because the researcher had simply made a mistake and given&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;the wrong jar initially.&nbsp;The results showed that those whose cookies became&nbsp;<br>scarce through the process of social demand&nbsp;liked the cookies significantly more than&nbsp;<br>did those whose cookies became scarce by mistake. In fact, the cookies made less&nbsp;<br>available through social demand&nbsp;were rated&nbsp;the most desirable of any in the study.&nbsp;<br>
This finding&nbsp;highlights the importance of&nbsp;competition in the pursuit of&nbsp;limited&nbsp;<br>resources. Not only do we want the same&nbsp;item&nbsp;more when it is scarce, we want it most&nbsp;<br>when we are in competition for it. Advertisers often try to exploit this tendency in&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=234></a>224&nbsp;<i>Chapter 7</i>&nbsp;<br>
us. In their ads, we learn that &quot;popular demand&quot; for an item is so great that&nbsp;we must&nbsp;<br>&quot;hurry to buy&quot;; we see a crowd pressing against the doors, of&nbsp;a store before the start of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br>sale; we watch a flock of hands quickly deplete a supermarket shelf of a product. There&nbsp;<br>is more to such images than the idea of&nbsp;ordinary social proof. The- message is not just&nbsp;<br>that the product is good because other people&nbsp;think so. but also that we are in direct&nbsp;<br>competition with those people for it.&nbsp;<br>
The feeling&nbsp;of&nbsp;being in competition for scarce resources has powerful motivating&nbsp;<br>properties. The ardor of an&nbsp;indifferent&nbsp;lover surges&nbsp;with the appearance of&nbsp;<i>i.&nbsp;</i>rival.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;<br>often for reasons of strategy, therefore, that&nbsp;romantic partners reveal (or invent) the&nbsp;<br>attentions of a new admirer. Salespeople&nbsp;are taught to play the same&nbsp;game with&nbsp;<br>indecisive customers. For example, a realtor&nbsp;who is trying to sell a house to&nbsp;a &quot;fence-<br>sitting&quot;&nbsp;prospect sometimes will call the prospect with news of&nbsp;another&nbsp;potential buyer&nbsp;<br>who has seen the house, liked&nbsp;it, and is scheduled to return the following day to talk&nbsp;<br>about terms.&nbsp;When wholly fabricated, the new&nbsp;bidder is commonly described as an&nbsp;<br>outsider with plenty of money:&nbsp;&quot;an out-of-state investor buying for tax purposes&quot; and &quot;a&nbsp;<br>physician and his wife moving into town&quot; are favorites. The tactic, called in some&nbsp;<br>circles &quot;goosing 'em&nbsp;off the fence,&quot; can work&nbsp;devastatingly well.&nbsp;The thought of losing&nbsp;<br>out to a rival frequently&nbsp;turns a buyer from&nbsp;hesitant&nbsp;<i>to&nbsp;</i>zealous,&nbsp;<br>
There is something almost physical about the desire to have a contested item. Shoppers&nbsp;<br>at big close-out or bargain sales report&nbsp;being caught up emotionally in the event.&nbsp;<br>Charged by the crush of&nbsp;competitors, they&nbsp;swarm and struggle to claim&nbsp;merchandise&nbsp;<br>they would otherwise disdain. Such behavior brings to mind the &quot;feeding frenzy&quot;&nbsp;<br>phenomenon of wild, indiscriminate eating among animal groups. Commercial&nbsp;<br>fishermen exploit the phenomenon by throwing&nbsp;a quantity of&nbsp;loose bait to large schools&nbsp;<br>of certain fish. Soon the water is a roiling expanse of thrashing fins and snapping&nbsp;<br>mouths competing for the food. At this point, the fishermen save time&nbsp;and money by&nbsp;<br>dropping unbated lines into the water, since&nbsp;the crazed fish&nbsp;will bite ferociously at&nbsp;<br>anything, including&nbsp;bare metal hooks.&nbsp;<br>
There is a noticeable parallel between the ways that commercial fishermen and&nbsp;<br>department stores&nbsp;generate a competitive fury among those they wish to&nbsp;hook. To attract&nbsp;<br>and arouse the catch,&nbsp;fishermen scatter some loose bait called chum. For similar&nbsp;<br>purposes, department stores holding a bargain sale toss out a few especially good deals&nbsp;<br>on prominently advertised items called loss leaders. If&nbsp;the&nbsp;bait—of&nbsp;either form—has&nbsp;<br>done its job, a large and eager crowd forms to&nbsp;snap it up. Soon, in the rush to score, the&nbsp;<br>group becomes agitated, nearly blinded, by the adversarial nature&nbsp;of the situation.&nbsp;<br>Human beings and fish alike lose perspective&nbsp;on what they want and begin striking at&nbsp;<br>whatever is being contested. One wonders whether the tuna flapping on a dry deck with&nbsp;<br>only a bare hook in its mouth shares the what-hit-me bewilderment of the shopper&nbsp;<br>arriving home&nbsp;with a load of&nbsp;department store bilge.&nbsp;<br>
Lest we believe that the competition-for-limited-resources&nbsp;fever occurs only&nbsp;in such&nbsp;<br>unsophisticated forms of life as tuna and bargain basement&nbsp;shoppers, we should&nbsp;<br>examine the story behind a remarkable purchase decision made in 1973 by Barry Diller,&nbsp;<br>who was vice president for prime-time programming of the American Broad-&nbsp;<br>

He agreed to&nbsp;pay $3.3 million&nbsp;for&nbsp;a single television showing&nbsp;of the movie&nbsp;<br><i>The Poseidon Adventure.&nbsp;</i>The figure is noteworthy in that it greatly exceeded&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>highest price ever before paid&nbsp;for&nbsp;a one-time movie showing—$2 million for&nbsp;<i>Pat-ton.&nbsp;</i>In&nbsp;<br>fact, the payment was so excessive that&nbsp;ABC figured to lose $1 million on the&nbsp;<i>Poseidon&nbsp;<br></i>showing.

How could an astute and experienced businessman like Diller go for a deal that would&nbsp;<br>produce an expected loss of&nbsp;$1 million&quot;? The answer may lie in a second noteworthy&nbsp;<br>aspect of&nbsp;the sale: It&nbsp;was the first time that a motion picture had been offered to the&nbsp;<br>networks in an open-bid auction. Never before&nbsp;had the three networks been forced to&nbsp;<br>battle for a scarce resource in quite this&nbsp;way. The novel idea of a competitive auction&nbsp;<br>was the brainchild of the movie's flamboyant showman producer, Irwin Allen, and 20th&nbsp;<br>Century-Fox&nbsp;vice president. William Self,&nbsp;who must have been ecstatic about the&nbsp;<br>outcome. How can we&nbsp;be sure that it was&nbsp;the auction format that generated the&nbsp;<br>spectacular sales price rather than the&nbsp;blockbluster quality of&nbsp;the movie itself?&nbsp;<br>
Some&nbsp;comments from&nbsp;the auction participants&nbsp;provide impressive evidence. First came&nbsp;<br>a statement from&nbsp;the victor, Barry Diller, intended to set future policy for his network.&nbsp;<br>In language sounding like it could have escaped&nbsp;only from between clenched teeth, he&nbsp;<br>said, &quot;ABC has decided regarding its policy&nbsp;for the future that it would never again&nbsp;<br>enter into&nbsp;an auction situation.&quot; Even more instructive are the remarks of&nbsp;Diller's rival,&nbsp;<br>Robert Wood, then president of CBS Television, who nearly lost his head and outbid his&nbsp;<br>competitors at ABC and NBC:&nbsp;<br>
<i>We were very rational at the&nbsp;start. We priced the movie out, in terms of&nbsp;what it could&nbsp;<br>bring in for us, then allowed a certain&nbsp;value on top of that for exploitation.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>But then the bidding started. ABC opened with $2 million.&nbsp;I came back with $2.4. ABC&nbsp;<br>went $2.8. And the fever of the thing caught us. Like a guy&nbsp;who had lost his mind, I kept&nbsp;<br>bidding. Finally, 1 went to $3.2; and there came&nbsp;a moment when I said to myself, &quot;Good&nbsp;<br>grief, if I get it, what the heck am I going to&nbsp;do with it?&quot; When ABC finally topped me,&nbsp;<br>my main feeling was relief.</i>&nbsp;<br>
<i>It's been very educational. (MacKenzie. 1974, p. 4)</i>&nbsp;<br>
According to interviewer&nbsp;Bob MacKenzie, when Wood&nbsp;said, &quot;It's been very&nbsp;<br>educational,&quot; he was&nbsp;smiling. We can be sure that when ABC's&nbsp;Diller vowed &quot;never&nbsp;<br>again,&quot; he was not. Both men had clearly learned a lesson from&nbsp;the &quot;Great&nbsp;<i>Poseidon&nbsp;<br></i>Auction.&quot; The reason that both could not smile&nbsp;as a consequence was that, for one, there&nbsp;<br>had been&nbsp;a $&nbsp;1 million tuition&nbsp;charge.&nbsp;Fortunately, there is a&nbsp;valuable but drastically less&nbsp;<br>expensive lesson here for us,&nbsp;too. It is instructive to&nbsp;note that the smiling man was the&nbsp;<br>one who had&nbsp;<i>lost&nbsp;</i>the highly sought-after prize. As a&nbsp;general rule, when the dust settles&nbsp;<br>and we find losers looking and speaking like winners (and&nbsp;vice versa), we should be&nbsp;<br>especially wary of the&nbsp;conditions that kicked up the dust—in the present case, open&nbsp;<br>competition&nbsp;for a scarce resource. As the TV executives learned, extreme caution is&nbsp;<br>advised whenever we encounter&nbsp;the devilish construction&nbsp;of scarcity plus rivalry.&nbsp;<br>

<b>DEFENSE</b>&nbsp;<br>
It is easy enough to feel properly warned&nbsp;against scarcity pressures, but it is&nbsp;<br>substantially&nbsp;more difficult to act on that warning.&nbsp;Part of&nbsp;the problem&nbsp;is that our typical&nbsp;<br>reaction to scarcity hinders our ability to&nbsp;think. When we watch as something we want&nbsp;<br>becomes less available, a physical agitation sets in. Especially in those cases involving&nbsp;<br>direct competition, the blood comes up, the focus narrows, and emotions rise. As this&nbsp;<br>visceral current advances, the cognitive, rational side retreats.&nbsp;In the&nbsp;rush of&nbsp;arousal, it is&nbsp;<br>difficult to be calm&nbsp;and studied in our approach. As CBS-TV president Robert Wood&nbsp;<br>commented in the wake of his&nbsp;<i>Poseidon&nbsp;</i>adventure, &quot;you get caught up in the mania of&nbsp;<br>the thing, the acceleration of it. Logic goes&nbsp;right out the window&quot; (MacKenzie, 1974).&nbsp;<br>
Here's our predicament, then: Knowing the&nbsp;causes and workings of scarcity pressures&nbsp;<br>may not be sufficient to&nbsp;protect us from&nbsp;them&nbsp;because knowing is a cognitive act, and&nbsp;<br>cognitive processes are suppressed by our emotional reaction to scarcity pressures.&nbsp;In&nbsp;<br>fact, this may be the reason for the great effectiveness of&nbsp;scarcity tactics. When they are&nbsp;<br>employed properly, our first line of defense against foolish behavior—a thoughtful&nbsp;<br>analysis of&nbsp;the situation—becomes less likely.&nbsp;<br>
If, because of brain-clouding arousal, we can't&nbsp;rely on our knowledge about the scarcity&nbsp;<br>principle to stimulate properly cautious behavior, what can we use?&nbsp;Perhaps, in fine&nbsp;<br>jujitsu style,&nbsp;we can use the arousal itself as&nbsp;our prime cue. In&nbsp;this way, we can turn the&nbsp;<br>enemy's strength to our advantage. Rather&nbsp;than relying on a considered, cognitive&nbsp;<br>analysis of the entire situation,&nbsp;we might well tune ourselves to&nbsp;just&nbsp;the internal,&nbsp;visceral&nbsp;<br>sweep for our warning. By learning to flag&nbsp;the experience of heightening arousal in a&nbsp;<br>compliance situation, we can alert ourselves to&nbsp;the possibility of scarcity tactics there&nbsp;<br>and to the need for caution.&nbsp;<br>
Suppose, however, we accomplish this trick of using the rising tide of&nbsp;arousal as a&nbsp;<br>signal to calm ourselves and to proceed with&nbsp;care. What then?&nbsp;Is there any other piece&nbsp;<br>of information we can use to help make a&nbsp;proper decision in&nbsp;the face of scarcity? After&nbsp;<br>all, merely recognizing that we ought to move&nbsp;carefully doesn't tell us the direction in&nbsp;<br>which to move; it only provides the necessary context for&nbsp;a thoughtful decision.&nbsp;<br>
Fortunately there is information available&nbsp;on which we can base&nbsp;thoughtful decisions&nbsp;<br>about scarce items. It comes, once again,&nbsp;from&nbsp;the chocolate chip cookie study, where&nbsp;<br>the researchers uncovered something that&nbsp;seems strange but rings true regarding&nbsp;<br>scarcity: Even though&nbsp;the scarce cookies were&nbsp;rated as significantly more desirable, they&nbsp;<br>were not rated as any better-tasting than the&nbsp;abundant cookies. So,&nbsp;despite the increased&nbsp;<br>yearning that scarcity caused (the raters said&nbsp;they wanted to have more of the scarce&nbsp;<br>cookies in the future and would pay a greater price for them), it did not make the&nbsp;<br>cookies taste one whit better. Therein lies an&nbsp;important insight. The joy is not in the&nbsp;<br>experiencing of a scarce commodity but in the possessing&nbsp;of&nbsp;it. It is&nbsp;important&nbsp;that we&nbsp;<br>not confuse the two. Whenever we confront&nbsp;the scarcity pressures surrounding some&nbsp;<br>item,&nbsp;we must also confront the question of what it is we&nbsp;<br>
<i>&nbsp;</i><br>
<hr>
<a name=239></a><i>Scarcity&nbsp;</i><b>229</b>&nbsp;<br>
want from&nbsp;the item. If the answer is that we want the thing for the social, economic, or&nbsp;<br>psychological benefits of possessing something rare, then, fine; scarcity pressures will&nbsp;<br>give us a good indication of&nbsp;how much we would want to&nbsp;pay for it—the less available&nbsp;<br>it is, the more valuable to us it will be. However, very often we don't want a thing for&nbsp;<br>the pure sake of owning it. We&nbsp;want it, instead,&nbsp;for its utility value; we want to eat it or&nbsp;<br>drink it or touch it or hear it or drive it or otherwise use it.&nbsp;In such cases it is vital to&nbsp;<br>remember that scarce things do not taste or&nbsp;feel or sound or ride or work any better&nbsp;<br><i>because&nbsp;</i>of&nbsp;their limited availability.&nbsp;<br>
Although this point is simple&nbsp;it can often escape us when we&nbsp;experience the heightened&nbsp;<br>desirability that scarce items naturally possess.&nbsp;I can cite a family example. My brother&nbsp;<br>Richard supported himself through school by employing a compliance trick that cashed&nbsp;<br>in handsomely on the tendency of most people&nbsp;to miss that simple point. In fact, his&nbsp;<br>tactic was so effective in this regard that&nbsp;he had to work only a few hours each weekend&nbsp;<br>for his money, leaving the rest of&nbsp;the time free for his studies.&nbsp;<br>
Richard sold cars, but&nbsp;not in a showroom&nbsp;or&nbsp;on a car lot. He would buy a couple of used&nbsp;<br>cars sold privately through the newspaper on&nbsp;one weekend, and adding nothing but soap&nbsp;<br>and water, would sell them&nbsp;at a decided profit through the newspaper on the following&nbsp;<br>weekend. To do this, he had to know three&nbsp;things. First, he had to know enough about&nbsp;<br>cars to buy those that were offered for sale&nbsp;at the bottom&nbsp;of their&nbsp;blue book price range&nbsp;<br>but that could be legitimately resold for a higher price. Second, once he got the car, he&nbsp;<br>had to know how to write a&nbsp;newspaper ad that would stimulate substantial buyer&nbsp;<br>interest. Third, once a buyer arrived, he had to&nbsp;know how to use the scarcity principle to&nbsp;<br>generate more desire for the car than&nbsp;it perhaps deserved. Richard knew how to do all&nbsp;<br>three. For our purposes, though, we need to examine his craft with just the third.&nbsp;<br>
For a car he had purchased on the prior weekend, he would place an ad&nbsp;in the Sunday&nbsp;<br>paper. Because he knew how to&nbsp;write a good ad, he usually received an array of calls&nbsp;<br>from&nbsp;potential buyers on Sunday morning. Each&nbsp;prospect who was interested enough to&nbsp;<br>want to see the car was given an appointment time—<i>the same appointment time.&nbsp;</i>So, if&nbsp;<br>six people were scheduled, they&nbsp;were all scheduled for, say, 2:00 that afternoon. This&nbsp;<br>little device of simultaneous&nbsp;scheduling paved the way for later compliance because it&nbsp;<br>created an atmosphere of&nbsp;competition&nbsp;for a limited resource.&nbsp;<br>
Typically, the first prospect to&nbsp;arrive would begin a studied examination of the car and&nbsp;<br>would engage in standard car-buying behavior, such as pointing&nbsp;out any blemishes or&nbsp;<br>deficiencies and asking if the price were&nbsp;negotiable. The psychology of the situation&nbsp;<br>changed radically, however, when the second buyer drove up. The availability of the car&nbsp;<br>to either prospect suddenly became limited&nbsp;by&nbsp;the presence of the other. Often&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>earlier arrival, inadvertently stoking&nbsp;the sense of rivalry, would&nbsp;assert his right to&nbsp;<br>primary consideration. &quot;Just a minute now, I was here first.&quot; If he didn't&nbsp;assert that right,&nbsp;<br>Richard would do it for him.&nbsp;Addressing the second buyer, he would say, &quot;Excuse me,&nbsp;<br>but this other gentleman was here before you. So, can I ask you to wait&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<hr>
<a name=240></a>230&nbsp;<i>Chapter 7</i>&nbsp;<br>
on the other side of the driveway for a few minutes until he's finished looking at the car?&nbsp;<br>Then, if he decides he doesn't&nbsp;want it or if&nbsp;he can't&nbsp;make up his mind, I'll show it to&nbsp;<br>you.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
Richard claims it was possible to watch the&nbsp;agitation grow on the first buyer's face. His&nbsp;<br>leisurely assessment of the car's pros and cons had suddenly become&nbsp;a now-or-never,&nbsp;<br>limited-time-only rush to a decision over a contested resource. If he didn't decide for the&nbsp;<br>car—at Richard's asking price—in the next&nbsp;few minutes, he might lose it for good to&nbsp;<br>that... that. .. lurking newcomer over there.&nbsp;The second buyer would&nbsp;be equally agitated&nbsp;<br>by the combination of rivalry and&nbsp;restricted availability. He would pace about the&nbsp;<br>periphery of things, visibly&nbsp;straining to get at this suddenly more desirable hunk of&nbsp;<br>metal. Should 2:00 appointment number one fail&nbsp;to buy or even fail&nbsp;to decide quickly&nbsp;<br>enough, 2:00 appointment number two was ready to pounce.&nbsp;<br>
If these conditions alone were not enough&nbsp;to secure a favorable purchase decision&nbsp;<br>immediately, the trap snapped securely shut&nbsp;as soon as the third 2:00 appointment&nbsp;<br>arrived on the scene. According&nbsp;to&nbsp;Richard, stacked-up competition&nbsp;was usually too&nbsp;<br>much for the first prospect to bear. He&nbsp;would end the pressure quickly by either&nbsp;<br>agreeing to Richard's price or by leaving abruptly. In the latter instance, the second&nbsp;<br>arrival would strike at the chance to buy out&nbsp;of a sense of relief coupled with a new&nbsp;<br>feeling of rivalry with that... that... lurking newcomer over there.&nbsp;<br>
All those buyers who contributed to my brother's college education failed to recognize a&nbsp;<br>fundamental fact about their purchases: The increased desire that&nbsp;spurred them to buy&nbsp;<br>had little to do with the merits of the car. The failure of recognition occurred for two&nbsp;<br>reasons. First, the situation&nbsp;that Richard arranged for them produced an emotional&nbsp;<br>reaction that made it difficult for them&nbsp;to think straight. Second, as&nbsp;a consequence, they&nbsp;<br>never stopped&nbsp;to think that the reason&nbsp;they wanted&nbsp;the car in the first place was to use&nbsp;it,&nbsp;<br>not merely to have it. The competition-for-a-scarce-resource&nbsp;pressures Richard applied&nbsp;<br>affected only their desire to have&nbsp;the car&nbsp;in the sense of possessing it. Those pressures&nbsp;<br>did not affect the value of the&nbsp;car in&nbsp;terms of the real purpose for which they had wanted&nbsp;<br>it.&nbsp;<br>
Should we find ourselves beset by scarcity pressures in a compliance situation, then, our&nbsp;<br>best response would occur in&nbsp;a two-stage sequence. As soon&nbsp;as we feel the tide of&nbsp;<br>emotional arousal that flows from&nbsp;scarcity influences, we should use that rise in arousal&nbsp;<br>as a signal to stop short.&nbsp;Panicky, feverish&nbsp;reactions have no&nbsp;place in wise compliance&nbsp;<br>decisions. We need to calm&nbsp;ourselves and regain a&nbsp;rational perspective. Once&nbsp;that is&nbsp;<br>done, we can move to the second stage by asking ourselves why we want the item&nbsp;under&nbsp;<br>consideration. If the answer is that we want it primarily for the purpose of owning it,&nbsp;<br>then we should use its availability to&nbsp;help&nbsp;gauge how much we would want to spend for&nbsp;<br>it. However,&nbsp;if&nbsp;the answer is that we&nbsp;want it primarily for its function (that is, we want&nbsp;<br>something good to drive or drink or eat), then we must remember that the item&nbsp;under&nbsp;<br>consideration will function equally well whether scarce&nbsp;or plentiful. Quite simply, we&nbsp;<br>need to recall that the scarce&nbsp;cookies didn't taste any better.&nbsp;<br>

<b>SUMMARY</b>&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;According&nbsp;to the scarcity principle, people assign more value to opportunities when&nbsp;<br>they are less available.&nbsp;The use of&nbsp;this&nbsp;principle for profit can be&nbsp;seen in such&nbsp;<br>compliance techniques&nbsp;as the &quot;limited number&quot; and &quot;deadline&quot; tactics, wherein&nbsp;<br>practitioners&nbsp;try to convince us&nbsp;that access to&nbsp;what they are offering is restricted&nbsp;by&nbsp;<br>amount or time.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;The scarcity principle holds for two reasons.&nbsp;First, because&nbsp;things that are difficult to&nbsp;<br>attain are typically more valuable, the availability of an item or experience can&nbsp;serve as&nbsp;<br>a shortcut cue to its quality. Second, as&nbsp;things become&nbsp;less accessible, we lose&nbsp;<br>freedoms. According to psychological reactance theory,&nbsp;we respond to the loss of&nbsp;<br>freedoms by wanting to have them&nbsp;(along&nbsp;with the goods and services connected to&nbsp;<br>them) more than before.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;As a motivator, psychological reactance is&nbsp;present throughout the great majority of the&nbsp;<br>life span. However, it is especially evident at&nbsp;a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;ages: the&nbsp;terrible twos and the&nbsp;<br>teenage years. Both of these times are characterized by an emerging sense of&nbsp;<br>individuality, which brings to prominence such&nbsp;issues&nbsp;as control,&nbsp;rights,&nbsp;and freedom.&nbsp;<br>Consequently, individuals at&nbsp;these ages are especially sensitive to restrictions.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;In addition&nbsp;to its&nbsp;effect on&nbsp;the&nbsp;valuation of&nbsp;commodities,&nbsp;the&nbsp;scarcity&nbsp;principle also&nbsp;<br>applies to the way that&nbsp;information is evaluated. Research indicates&nbsp;that the act of&nbsp;<br>limiting access to&nbsp;a message causes individuals to&nbsp;want to receive it more and&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>become&nbsp;more&nbsp;favorable to it. The latter of&nbsp;these findings—that limited information is&nbsp;<br>more persuasive—seems the more surprising.&nbsp;In the case&nbsp;of censorship, this effect&nbsp;<br>occurs even&nbsp;when the message has not been received. When a message has been&nbsp;<br>received, it is more effective if it is perceived as consisting of&nbsp;exclusive information.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;The scarcity principle is most likely to hold true under two optimizing conditions.&nbsp;<br>First, scarce items are heightened in value when they are newly&nbsp;scarce. That is, we value&nbsp;<br>those things that have become recently restricted more than those that were restricted all&nbsp;<br>along. Second, we are most attracted to scarce resources when we compete with others&nbsp;<br>for them.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;It is difficult to steel ourselves cognitively against scarcity pressures because they have&nbsp;<br>an emotion-arousing quality that makes thinking difficult. In defense, we might try to be&nbsp;<br>alert to a rush of arousal in&nbsp;situations involving scarcity. Once alerted, we can take steps&nbsp;<br>to calm&nbsp;the arousal and assess the merits of the opportunity in terms of why we want it.&nbsp;<br>

<hr>
<a name=244></a>Back in the 1960s a man named Joe&nbsp;Pine hosted&nbsp;a rather remarkable TV talk show that&nbsp;<br>was syndicated from&nbsp;California. The program&nbsp;was made distinctive by Pine's caustic&nbsp;<br>and confrontational style with his guests—for the most part, a collection of exposure-<br>hungry entertainers, would-be celebrities, and representatives of fringe political or&nbsp;<br>social organizations. The host's abrasive approach was designed to&nbsp;provoke his guests&nbsp;<br>into arguments, to&nbsp;fluster them&nbsp;into embarrassing admissions, and&nbsp;generally to make&nbsp;<br>them&nbsp;look foolish. It was not uncommon for&nbsp;Pine to introduce a visitor and launch&nbsp;<br>immediately into an attack on the individual's&nbsp;beliefs, talent, or appearance. Some&nbsp;<br>people claimed that Pine's acid personal style was partially caused by a leg amputation&nbsp;<br>that had embittered him&nbsp;to life; others said, no, that he was just&nbsp;vituperative by nature.&nbsp;<br>
One evening&nbsp;rock&nbsp;musician Frank&nbsp;Zappa was a guest on&nbsp;the show. This was at a time&nbsp;in&nbsp;<br>the 1960s when very long hair on men was still unusual and controversial. As soon as&nbsp;<br>Zappa had been introduced and seated, the following exchange occurred:&nbsp;<br>
<i>Pine: I&nbsp;</i>guess your long hair makes you a girl.&nbsp;<i>Zappa:&nbsp;</i>I guess your wooden leg makes&nbsp;<br>you a table.&nbsp;<br>
<b>PRIMITIVE AUTOMATICITY</b>&nbsp;<br>
Aside from&nbsp;containing what may be my favorite ad-lib, the dialogue between Pine and&nbsp;<br>Zappa illustrates a fundamental theme of this book: Very often when we make a&nbsp;<br>decision about someone or something we don't use all of the relevant available&nbsp;<br>information. We use, instead, only a single,&nbsp;highly representative piece of the total. An&nbsp;<br>isolated piece of information, even though it normally counsels us correctly, can lead us&nbsp;<br>to clearly stupid mistakes—mistakes that,&nbsp;when exploited by clever others, leave us&nbsp;<br>looking silly or worse.&nbsp;<br>
At the same&nbsp;time, a complicating companion theme has been present throughout this&nbsp;<br>book: Despite the susceptibility to stupid decisions that accompanies a reliance on a&nbsp;<br>single feature of the available data, the pace&nbsp;of modern life demands that we frequently&nbsp;<br>use this shortcut. Recall that&nbsp;early&nbsp;in Chapter&nbsp;1, we compared this shortcut&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<br>automatic responding of lower animals, whose elaborate behavior&nbsp;patterns could be&nbsp;<br>triggered by the presence of a lone stimulus feature—a cheep-cheep sound, a shade of&nbsp;<br>red breast feather, or a specific sequence&nbsp;of light flashes.&nbsp;The reason&nbsp;these lower&nbsp;<br>animals must often rely on such solitary stimulus features of&nbsp;their environments is their&nbsp;<br>restricted mental capacity. Their&nbsp;small brains cannot begin to&nbsp;<br>

register and process all of&nbsp;the relevant information in their environments. So these&nbsp;<br>species have evolved special sensitivities to&nbsp;certain aspects of the information. Because&nbsp;<br>those selected aspects of information are&nbsp;normally enough to cue a correct response, the&nbsp;<br>system&nbsp;is usually very efficient: Whenever a mother turkey&nbsp;hears cheep,&nbsp;cheep,&nbsp;<i>click,&nbsp;<br>whirr,&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>out rolls the proper maternal behavior&nbsp;in a mechanical fashion&nbsp;that conserves&nbsp;<br>much of her limited brainpower for dealing with the other situations and choices she&nbsp;<br>must face in&nbsp;her day.&nbsp;<br>
We, of course, have vastly more effective brain mechanisms&nbsp;than do mother turkeys,&nbsp;or&nbsp;<br>any other animal group, for that matter. We are unchallenged in the ability to take into&nbsp;<br>account a multitude of relevant facts and, consequently, to make&nbsp;good decisions. Indeed,&nbsp;<br>it is this information-processing advantage over other species that has helped make us&nbsp;<br>the dominant form&nbsp;of life on the planet.&nbsp;<br>
Still, we have our capacity limitations, too;&nbsp;and, for the sake of efficiency, we must&nbsp;<br>sometimes retreat from the time-consuming,&nbsp;sophisticated, fully informed brand of&nbsp;<br>decision making to a more automatic, primitive,&nbsp;single-feature type of responding. For&nbsp;<br>instance, in deciding whether to&nbsp;say yes or no to a requester,&nbsp;we frequently pay attention&nbsp;<br>to a single piece of the relevant&nbsp;information&nbsp;in the situation.&nbsp;In preceding chapters, we&nbsp;<br>have explored several of the most popular of&nbsp;the single pieces of information that we&nbsp;<br>use to prompt our compliance decisions. They are the most popular prompts precisely&nbsp;<br>because they are the most reliable ones, those that normally point us toward the correct&nbsp;<br>choice. That is why we employ the factors of&nbsp;reciprocation, consistency, social proof,&nbsp;<br>liking,&nbsp;authority,&nbsp;and scarcity&nbsp;so often and so automatically in making our compliance&nbsp;<br>decisions. Each, by itself,&nbsp;provides a&nbsp;highly reliable cue as to&nbsp;when we will be better off&nbsp;<br>saying yes instead of no.&nbsp;<br>
We are likely to use these lone&nbsp;cues when we don't have the inclination, time, energy, or&nbsp;<br>cognitive resources to undertake a complete&nbsp;analysis of the situation. When we are&nbsp;<br>rushed, stressed, uncertain, indifferent, distracted, or fatigued, we tend to focus on less&nbsp;<br>of the information available to us. When&nbsp;making decisions under these circumstances,&nbsp;<br>we often revert to the rather primitive&nbsp;but necessary single-piece-of-good-evidence&nbsp;<br>approach.1&nbsp;All this leads to an&nbsp;unnerving insight: With the sophisticated mental&nbsp;<br>apparatus we&nbsp;have used to build world eminence as a species, we have created&nbsp;an&nbsp;<br>environment so complex, fast-paced, and information-laden&nbsp;that we must increasingly&nbsp;<br>deal with it in the fashion of the animals we long ago transcended.&nbsp;<br>
Sometimes the consequences can be calamitous. Remember the&nbsp;FBI's infamously&nbsp;<br>misguided assault on Branch Davidian Church&nbsp;headquarters in Waco, Texas?&nbsp;According&nbsp;<br>to an analysis by U.S. Justice Department consultants, during the&nbsp;<br>

FBI's 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian's compound, the&nbsp;agency collected so much&nbsp;<br>information that it had to ignore the vast majority of it. Said Professor Robert Louden,&nbsp;<br>one of the Justice Department's consultants,&nbsp;&quot;The FBI had such an intelligence&nbsp;<br>information overload that. .. they just fell back on&nbsp;past practice—and since they didn't&nbsp;<br>have any experience with religion, they treated it like a standard barricade&quot; (&quot;Overload&nbsp;<br>of Advice,&quot; 1993). The disastrous outcome&nbsp;was that, when the FBI finally attacked,&nbsp;<br>more than 80 sect members died in an&nbsp;act of faith- and fear-fueled self-emulation.&nbsp;<br>
<b>MODERN AUTOMATICITY</b>&nbsp;<br>
John Stuart Mill,&nbsp;the British&nbsp;economist, political thinker, and philosopher of science,&nbsp;<br>died over 125 years ago. The year of his death&nbsp;(1873) is important because he is reputed&nbsp;<br>to have been the last man to know everything there was to know&nbsp;in the world. Today,&nbsp;<br>the notion that one of us could be aware of&nbsp;all known facts is laughable. After eons of&nbsp;<br>slow accumulation, human knowledge has snowballed into&nbsp;an era of momentum-fed,&nbsp;<br>multiplicative, monstrous expansion.&nbsp;We&nbsp;now live in a world where&nbsp;most of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>information is less than 15 years old. In certain fields of&nbsp;science alone (physics, for&nbsp;<br>example), knowledge is said to double every&nbsp;eight years. The scientific information&nbsp;<br>explosion is&nbsp;not limited&nbsp;to such arcane arenas&nbsp;as molecular chemistry or quantum&nbsp;<br>physics, but extends to everyday areas of knowledge where we strive to keep ourselves&nbsp;<br>current—health, child development, nutrition.&nbsp;What's&nbsp;more, this rapid growth is likely&nbsp;<br>to continue, since researchers are pumping&nbsp;their newest findings into an estimated&nbsp;<br>400,000 scientific journals worldwide.&nbsp;<br>
Apart from&nbsp;the streaking&nbsp;advance of science, things are quickly changing much closer to&nbsp;<br>home. According to yearly Gallup polls, the issues rated as&nbsp;most important on the public&nbsp;<br>agenda are becoming more diverse and are surviving on that agenda for a shorter time&nbsp;<br>(McCombs &amp; Zhu, 1995). In addition, we travel&nbsp;more and faster; we relocate more&nbsp;<br>frequently to new residences, which are built and torn down more quickly; we contact&nbsp;<br>more people and have shorter relationships&nbsp;with them; in the supermarket, car&nbsp;<br>showroom, and shopping&nbsp;mall, we are faced with an array of&nbsp;choices among styles and&nbsp;<br>products that were unheard-of&nbsp;last year and may well be obsolete or forgotten by next&nbsp;<br>year. Novelty, transience, diversity, and acceleration are acknowledged as prime&nbsp;<br>descriptors of civilized existence.&nbsp;<br>
This avalanche of information and choices is made possible by burgeoning&nbsp;<br>technological progress. Leading the way are developments in our ability to collect,&nbsp;<br>store, retrieve, and communicate information. At&nbsp;first, the fruits of such advances were&nbsp;<br>limited to large organizations—government agencies or&nbsp;powerful corporations. With&nbsp;<br>further developments in telecommunications and computer technology, access to such&nbsp;<br>staggering amounts of information is falling&nbsp;within the reach of&nbsp;individual citizens.&nbsp;<br>Extensive cable and satellite systems&nbsp;provide&nbsp;one route for that information into the&nbsp;<br>average home.&nbsp;<br>

The other major route is the personal computer. In 1972, Norman Macrae, an editor of&nbsp;<br>the The&nbsp;<i>Economist,&nbsp;</i>speculated prophetically about a time in the future:&nbsp;<br>
<i>The prospect is, after all, that we are going to enter an age&nbsp;when any duffer&nbsp;sitting at a&nbsp;<br>computer terminal in his laboratory or office or public library or home can delve&nbsp;<br>through unimaginable increased mountains of&nbsp;information in mass-assembly data banks&nbsp;<br>with mechanical powers of concentration and&nbsp;calculation that will be greater by a&nbsp;<br>factor of tens of thousands than was ever&nbsp;available to the human brain of even an&nbsp;<br>Einstein. (Macrae, 1972)</i>&nbsp;<br>
Just one decade later,&nbsp;<i>Time&nbsp;</i>magazine signaled that Macrae's future age had arrived by&nbsp;<br>naming a machine, the personal computer, as its Man of the Year.&nbsp;<i>Time's&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>editors&nbsp;<br>defended their choice by citing the consumer&nbsp;&quot;stampede&quot; to purchase small computers&nbsp;<br>and by arguing that &quot;America [and], in a larger&nbsp;perspective,&nbsp;the entire world will never&nbsp;<br>be the same.&quot; Macrae's vision is presently being realized. Millions of ordinary &quot;duffers&quot;&nbsp;<br>are sitting in front of computers with the potential to present and&nbsp;analyze enough data to&nbsp;<br>bury an Einstein.&nbsp;<br>
Modern day visionaries—like Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft—agree with Macrae,&nbsp;<br>asserting that we are creating an array of&nbsp;devices capable of delivering a universe of&nbsp;<br>information &quot;to anyone, anywhere, anytime&quot; (Davidson, 1999). But notice something&nbsp;<br>telling: Our modern era, often termed&nbsp;The Information Age, has never been called The&nbsp;<br>Knowledge Age. Information does not translate&nbsp;directly into knowledge. It must first be&nbsp;<br>processed—accessed, absorbed, comprehended, integrated, and retained.&nbsp;<br>

<b>SHORTCUTS SHALL BE SACRED</b>&nbsp;<br>
Because technology can&nbsp;evolve much faster than&nbsp;we can, our natural capacity&nbsp;to&nbsp;process&nbsp;<br>information is likely to be increasingly inadequate to handle the abundance of change,&nbsp;<br>choice, and&nbsp;the challenge that&nbsp;is&nbsp;characteristic of&nbsp;modern life. More and more&nbsp;<br>frequently, we will find&nbsp;ourselves&nbsp;in the position of&nbsp;lower animals—with a mental&nbsp;<br>apparatus that is unequipped to deal thoroughly with the intricacy and richness of the&nbsp;<br>outside&nbsp;environment. Unlike&nbsp;the&nbsp;lower animals,&nbsp;whose cognitive powers have&nbsp;always&nbsp;<br>teen relatively deficient, we have created&nbsp;our own deficiency by constructing a radically&nbsp;<br>more complex world. The consequence of our new deficiency is the same as that of the&nbsp;<br>animals' long-standing one: when making a decision, we will less frequently engage in a&nbsp;<br>fully considered analysis of&nbsp;the total situation. In response to&nbsp;this&nbsp;&quot;paralysis&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>analysis,&quot; we will revert increasingly to a focus on a single, usually reliable feature of&nbsp;<br>the situation.&nbsp;<br>
When those single features are&nbsp;truly reliable, there is nothing inherently wrong with the-&nbsp;<br>shortcut approach of narrowed attention and automatic responding to&nbsp;a particular piece&nbsp;<br>of information. The problem&nbsp;comes&nbsp;when&nbsp;something causes the normally trustworthy&nbsp;<br>cues to counsel us poorly, to lead us to erroneous actions and wrongheaded decisions.&nbsp;<br>As we have seen, one such cause&nbsp;is&nbsp;the trickery of&nbsp;certain compliance practitioners, who&nbsp;<br>seek to profit from&nbsp;the mindless and mechanical nature of shortcut&nbsp;responding. If, as it&nbsp;<br>seems, the frequency of&nbsp;shortcut responding&nbsp;is increasing with the pace and form of&nbsp;<br>modern life, we can be sure that the frequency&nbsp;of&nbsp;this trickery&nbsp;is destined&nbsp;to increase as&nbsp;<br>well.&nbsp;<br>
What can we do about the expected intensified attack on our system&nbsp;of shortcuts?&nbsp;More&nbsp;<br>than evasive action, I urge forceful counterassault; however, there is an important&nbsp;<br>qualification. Compliance professionals who&nbsp;play fairly&nbsp;by the&nbsp;rules of shortcut&nbsp;<br>responding are not to be considered the enemy;&nbsp;to the contrary, they are our allies in an&nbsp;<br>efficient and adaptive process of exchange. The proper targets for counter-aggression&nbsp;<br>are only those individuals who falsify, counterfeit, or misrepresent the evidence that&nbsp;<br>naturally cues our&nbsp;shortcut responses.&nbsp;<br>
Let's take an&nbsp;illustration&nbsp;from&nbsp;what is&nbsp;perhaps our most frequently&nbsp;used shortcut.&nbsp;<br>According to the principle of social proof,&nbsp;we&nbsp;often decide to do what other people like&nbsp;<br>us are doing. It makes all kinds of sense since,&nbsp;most of the time, an&nbsp;action that is popular&nbsp;<br>in a given situation is also functional and&nbsp;appropriate. Thus, an advertiser who, without&nbsp;<br>using deceptive statistics,&nbsp;provides information that a brand of&nbsp;toothpaste is the largest&nbsp;<br>selling has offered us valuable evidence about the quality of the product and the&nbsp;<br>probability&nbsp;that we will like it.&nbsp;Provided that&nbsp;we are in&nbsp;the market for a tube of good&nbsp;<br>toothpaste, we might want to rely on that&nbsp;single piece of information, popularity,&nbsp;to&nbsp;<br>decide to try&nbsp;it. This strategy will likely steer us right, will unlikely steer&nbsp;us far wrong,&nbsp;<br>and will conserve our cognitive energies for&nbsp;dealing with the rest&nbsp;of our increasingly&nbsp;<br>information-laden, decision-overloaded environment. The advertiser who allows us to&nbsp;<br>use effectively this efficient&nbsp;strategy is hardly our antagonist but rather our cooperating&nbsp;<br>partner.&nbsp;<br>
<i>&nbsp;</i><br>
<hr>
<a name=249></a><i>Instant Influence&nbsp;</i>239&nbsp;<br>
The story becomes quite different, however,&nbsp;when a compliance practitioner tries to&nbsp;<br>stimulate a shortcut response by giving us a&nbsp;fraudulent signal for it. The enemy is&nbsp;an&nbsp;<br>advertiser who seeks to create an image&nbsp;of popularity for a brand of toothpaste by, say,&nbsp;<br>constructing&nbsp;a series of staged &quot;unrehearsed&nbsp;interview&quot; commercials in which an array&nbsp;<br>of actors posing as ordinary&nbsp;citizens praises the product. Here, where the evidence of&nbsp;<br>popularity is counterfeit, we, the principle of&nbsp;social proof, and our shortcut response to&nbsp;<br>it, are all being exploited. In&nbsp;an earlier chapter, I recommended against the purchase of&nbsp;<br>any product featured in a faked &quot;unrehearsed interview&quot; ad and urged that we send the&nbsp;<br>product manufacturers letters detailing the reason and suggesting that they dismiss their&nbsp;<br>advertising agency. I also recommended extending this aggressive stance to any&nbsp;<br>situation in which a compliance professional abuses the principle of social proof (or any&nbsp;<br>other weapon of influence) in this manner.&nbsp;We&nbsp;should refuse to watch TV&nbsp;programs that&nbsp;<br>use canned laughter. If we see a bartender begin&nbsp;a shift by salting the tip jar with a bill&nbsp;<br>or two, that bartender should get no tip from&nbsp;us. If, after waiting in&nbsp;line outside a&nbsp;<br>nightclub, we discover from&nbsp;the&nbsp;amount of available space that the wait was designed to&nbsp;<br>impress passersby with false evidence of the club's popularity, we should leave&nbsp;<br>immediately and announce our reason to those&nbsp;still in line. In short, we should be&nbsp;<br>willing to use boycott, threat, confrontation, censure, tirade, nearly anything, to retaliate.&nbsp;<br>
I don't consider myself pugnacious by nature, but I actively&nbsp;advocate such belligerent&nbsp;<br>actions because in a way I am at war with the&nbsp;exploiters. We all are. It is important to&nbsp;<br>recognize, however, that their motive for profit is not the cause&nbsp;for hostilities; that&nbsp;<br>motive, after all, is something we each share to&nbsp;an extent. The real treachery, and what&nbsp;<br>we cannot tolerate, is any attempt to make&nbsp;their profit in a way that threatens the&nbsp;<br>reliability&nbsp;of&nbsp;our shortcuts. The blitz of&nbsp;modern daily life demands that&nbsp;we have faithful&nbsp;<br>shortcuts, sound rules of thumb in order to&nbsp;handle it all. These&nbsp;are no longer luxuries;&nbsp;<br>they are out-and-out necessities that figure to&nbsp;become increasingly vital as the pulse&nbsp;<br>quickens. That is why we should want to retaliate whenever we see someone betraying&nbsp;<br>one of our rules of thumb for profit. We want that rule to be as effective as possible. To&nbsp;<br>the degree that its fitness for duty is regularly&nbsp;undercut by the tricks&nbsp;of a profiteer, we&nbsp;<br>naturally will use it less and will be less able to cope efficiently with the decisional&nbsp;<br>burdens of our day. That we cannot allow without a fight. The stakes are far too high.&nbsp;<br>
<b>SUMMARY</b>&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;Modern life is different from&nbsp;any earlier&nbsp;time. Because of remarkable technological&nbsp;<br>advances, information is burgeoning, choices&nbsp;and alternatives are expanding, knowledge&nbsp;<br>is exploding. In this&nbsp;avalanche of change&nbsp;and choice, we have&nbsp;had to&nbsp;adjust. One&nbsp;<br>fundamental adjustment has come&nbsp;in the way we make decisions. Although we all wish&nbsp;<br>to make the&nbsp;most thoughtful, fully considered decision possible in any situation, the&nbsp;<br>changing form and accelerating pace of&nbsp;<br>

modern life frequently deprive us of the proper conditions for such a careful analysis&nbsp;of&nbsp;<br>all the relevant pros and cons. More and more, we are forced to resort to another&nbsp;<br>decision-making approach—a shortcut approach in which the decision to comply (or&nbsp;<br>agree or believe or buy) is made on the basis of a single, usually reliable piece of&nbsp;<br>information. The most reliable and, therefore, most popular such single triggers for&nbsp;<br>compliance are those described throughout this book. They are commitments,&nbsp;<br>opportunities for reciprocation, the compliant behavior of&nbsp;similar others, feelings of&nbsp;<br>liking or friendship, authority directives, and scarcity information.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;Because of the increasing tendency for&nbsp;cognitive overload&nbsp;in&nbsp;our society,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<br>prevalence of shortcut decision making is likely to increase proportionately.&nbsp;<br>Compliance professionals who infuse their requests with one&nbsp;or another of the triggers&nbsp;<br>of influence are more likely to be successful.&nbsp;The use of these triggers by practitioners is&nbsp;<br>not necessarily exploitative. It only becomes so&nbsp;when the trigger is not a natural feature&nbsp;<br>of the situation but is fabricated by the practitioner. In order to retain the beneficial&nbsp;<br>character of&nbsp;shortcut response, it is important to oppose such fabrication by all&nbsp;<br>appropriate means.&nbsp;<br>
<b>STUDY QUESTIONS&nbsp;<i>Critical&nbsp;Thinking</i></b>&nbsp;<br>
1. Pick any three of the weapons of influence described in this book. Discuss in each&nbsp;<br>case how the weapon could be used to enhance compliance in what you would consider&nbsp;<br>an exploitative manner and in what you would consider a nonexploitative manner.&nbsp;<br>
2. For each of the three weapons of influence you choose, describe the way you would&nbsp;<br>defend yourself should the weapon be used&nbsp;against you in an exploitative fashion.&nbsp;<br>
3. Describe the three most important lessons&nbsp;that you have learned about the influence&nbsp;<br>process from this book.&nbsp;<br>
