<h1>How the Highland People Came to Be</h1>

<hr/>

<p class="first">Nictay paused in her leaf gathering. From the jungle shadows, she watched the battlefield. Not long after the Moon warriors had retreated with their captives, women of the Red Crown village had come into the bloodied fields of maize stubble to care for wounded brothers and husbands, to wail for the dead, to grieve for the defenders who had been taken captive. The attackers had lost men, too. Red Crown warriors led some of the Moon warriors into the village as prisoners. Other Red Crown warriors helped the women to carry the wounded and the dead.</p>

<p>Soon, Nictay knew, those men would return across the field of battle and satisfy themselves that the invaders had not lingered in the jungle to set an ambush. Once they were sure that all the able-bodied Moon warriors had retreated, they would scour the jungle for stragglers like the one Nictay had found. But Nictay meant for the big, scarred Moon warrior to be <i>her</i> captive.</p>

<p>She whispered her apologies to the plants as she pulled off more leaves. <q>Forgive me, Her Daughter. My need is great. I thank you for what I must take.</q> Then she hurried back to the tree where her Moon warrior sat with his obsidian-toothed club in his lap. Among his fresh wounds were traces of old ones; he had many white scars on his arms and legs, and one on his cheek. His nose had been broken some time in the past and healed crooked. His expression was so passive, his posture looked so relaxed that he seemed to be merely taking his ease. But his skin looked gray. He had lost a lot of blood.</p>

<p><q>What is your name?</q> she asked.</p>

<p><q>Do your priests care how their sacrifices are named?</q> His words came slowly, as if he were drunk on balche. But it was blood loss, no doubt. Nictay&rsquo;s words had been heavy in her mouth like that when she had bled herself, seeking a vision.</p>

<p>Nictay bound the leaves to his legs with cotton string. <q>I have already told you. I am not from this village. My people do not make sacrifice of their captives. Our gods demand only the sacrifice that they take themselves upon the sea. Fishermen drown, and the gods are satisfied.</q> She gave him a water gourd. <q>Drink.</q></p>

<p>He sipped, watching her. <q>If you are not of these people,</q> he said, <q>then they will think you are of mine.</q> The water had helped. Words slipped more easily from his lips.</p>

<p><q>I am not dressed as one of your women.</q></p>

<p><q>No,</q> he admitted, taking in the details of her plain cotton cloak, her shell necklace <q>But they will not stop to consider. It will not go well for you.</q></p>

<p><q>That is why you must stand. We must get away from here.</q></p>

<p><q>You saw my legs. Leave me! The gods have made their decision about me. Maker of Himself has decided.</q> Breath whistled through his crooked nose.</p>

<p><q>You are as good as dead if I leave you. And if I save you, your life is mine.</q></p>

<p><q>The gods have decided.</q></p>

<p><q>No god attacked you, but men. You fought well. Swinging your great club, wearing your feathered helmet &hellip; how great a prize you seemed! That is why so many tried for you. Now stand.</q></p>

<p><q>But my legs&hellip;.</q></p>

<p><q>The Red Crowns cut you many times, yes, but they did not sever the tendons. Up!</q> She picked up her spear, then strained to lift him. He made no effort to stand.</p>

<p><q>Why should I go with you?</q></p>

<p><q>Because you&rsquo;ll die if you stay!</q></p>

<p><q>If I&rsquo;m to save myself, let me crawl after my own men.</q></p>

<p><q>I need you.</q></p>

<p>His gaze on her was hard, speculative. <q>Need me for what?</q></p>

<p>Nictay pursed her lips. She could tell him the truth, but the trials of her village meant nothing to foreigners. Once again, she would have to lie.</p>

<p><q>Come with me, and I will make you a rich and powerful noble.</q></p>

<p>He grimaced. <q>I am a Nacom of the Moon People. Would you make me greater than that?</q></p>

<p>So he was indeed a great warrior. A veteran. A general. He was just what she was looking for. <q>I would make you a rival to the greatest Nacoms of the Middle People,</q> she said. <q>That jade you wear on your breast plate, the feathers of your helmet are nothing compared to the wealth my people take from the sea.</q></p>

<p>The warrior grunted. <q>Who are you to offer these things?</q></p>

<p><q>I am a princess.</q></p>

<p>The sound he made was like soft laughter, but bitter. <q>You haven&rsquo;t the look of nobility.</q></p>

<p><q>Our customs are not like yours,</q> she said, <q>and I do not travel in my regalia. Why should I call attention to myself?</q></p>

<p><q>A woman alone is of interest whether she is high or low,</q> he said.</p>

<p><q>And so I have come here by stealth. Will you quibble with me until the Red Crowns come? Stand! I have need of a warrior like you.</q> She strained again to lift him.</p>

<p>Shakily, he rose. He said, <q>There is no honor in bleeding to death in the jungle, Shell Woman.</q></p>

<p><q>You will be honored among my people. Alive.</q></p>

<p><q>As if I could walk all the way to the sea. I don&rsquo;t have that many steps in my legs.</q></p>

<p><q>Take one,</q> she said.</p>

<p>Leaning against her, he took a step, trembling. He made a bitter face, as if embarrassed by his weakness. She had been about to offer to carry his club, but thought better of it.</p>

<p><q>Another step now,</q> she said, looking over her shoulder toward the village. <q>And another.</q></p>

<p><q>Caan Cuy,</q> he said. <q>My name is Caan Cuy.</q></p>

<p><q>I am called Nictay,</q> she said. <q>The Princess Nictay.</q></p>

<hr/>

<p>At home, her grandmother had warned her about lies. Shaking a half-shucked corncob at her granddaughter, she had said, <q>One day you will reap a harvest from them that you do not expect.</q> But how could Nictay fulfill the tasks that her visions set for her except by lying? Foreigners would not want to give her willingly what she sought when she ventured into enemy lands to spy. So she had pretended to be a trader from a non-existent city, a representative of a noble, offering cacao on terms that were <i>almost</i> too good to be true. Greed made the enemy merchants eager to offer her protection and information. They gave her gifts of city clothes, and she ended up looking more and more like who she pretended to be. She had lied her way to the valley of the Middle People, had seen their Island City in the center of a mountain lake. She had seen how powerful they really were. And she had learned that the Middle People had overrun and destroyed villages and even whole cities that opposed them.</p>

<p>When she first learned this, when she first confirmed the ferocity of the Middle People, she despaired. Not long ago, Nictay&rsquo;s village had never even heard of the Middle People. Now, because of the Middle People raiders, Nictay&rsquo;s people had been forced to take refuge on an island off the coast, but without fresh water, the island was no place to settle for good. Were Nictay&rsquo;s people to be extinguished by this new enemy?</p>

<p>But Nictay had learned of more than the Middle People&rsquo;s ferocity. She had discovered something that gave her hope. The Middle People did not sack all the villages and cities they warred against. Many people <i>were</i> driven from their ancestral lands, never to return. But the Middle People respected enemies who fought as they did, who traded captives in battle. If her people could learn these foreign ways, they might negotiate, if not peace, a sustainable enmity that would let them return to their own lands. The only costs would be some tribute, perhaps fish, and the obligation to fight the Middle People now and then in flower wars, losing a few villagers as captives for sacrifice. This was better than annihilation.</p>

<p>How could her people learn to fight Flower Wars, those ritual battles to exchange captives? The obsidian toothed war clubs were unknown to Nictay&rsquo;s village until the first Middle People raiders had come. Nictay&rsquo;s people fought and hunted with spears. They did not know how to block and attack with a shield, how to slash at an enemy&rsquo;s legs and take a captive. They didn&rsquo;t know how to fix the obsidian points into the club&rsquo;s flat blade, like teeth in a shark&rsquo;s jaw.</p>

<p>Certain that she must discover how to teach these new ways, Nictay returned to her village. She bled herself and fasted for a vision.</p>

<p>Then the First Mother has shown her the path she must walk. She must take a captive. Not one of the Middle People, but a warrior who fought like them. She must bring home a master of the obsidian club, some fighter from the southern peoples: the Jaguar Tails, the Red Crowns, the Dog Eaters. Or a Moon warrior, a man like Caan Cuy.</p>

<p>So it was that she had crossed jungle alone. She had seen a war party leaving the Moon city, and she had followed them to the Red Crown Village. Hidden in the jungle, she watched the battle unfold. Caan Cuy was brilliant, cutting at the legs of his enemies with the black teeth of his club, knocking them down with his shield. He might have taken many captives had the Red Crowns not ganged up on him.</p>

<p>It had all gone perfectly. Caan Cuy, her captive, a teacher for her people, had been wounded just enough to be left behind, but not so badly that she had no chance of saving him. He would be the teacher her village required. </p>

<hr/>

<p>They were slow. Caan Cuy&rsquo;s legs stiffened on the second day, and he took even shorter, shakier steps. Then the rains came. Water fell in torrents through the canopy. Big drops pelted their skin like pebbles wherever they crossed a clearing open to the sky. In places, the mud was slick and greasy. In others, it was watery and sucked at their feet.</p>

<p>From time to time, she noticed that he would look toward the south as if considering a return to his own people. She would make up stories, then, of the riches that her father bestowed on warriors. She did not worry yet what Caan Cuy would do once he learned that her father was a simple fisherman, that there was no emperor among her people. What would he say when he found no stone palaces, when he saw that the only riches were in fish and fruit and shells? She would deal with that later. What mattered was getting him back to her people, pressing him closer to them and farther from the Moon city.</p>

<p>On the third day, Caan Cuy&rsquo;s fever began. He stopped often to stare through the rain-grayed air, as if he saw enemies where there were only more trees.</p>

<p>They were hungry all the time. Nictay could not leave Caan Cuy to hunt for fear that she would not find him again. She crushed ants with her fingers. They were sour, and it took so long to gather them that they were hardly better than nothing.</p>

<p>In the middle of the fourth rain-soaked night, Caan Cuy groaned out, <q>Water!</q> He waved his hands before his face. <q>Water!</q></p>

<p>In the darkness, Nictay groped for the gourd. She brought it to him, but he pushed it away and said, <q>Too much water!</q> She made him drink anyway, and once he had taken a swallow, he drank eagerly. Then his hands flailed again against the rain. <q>Too much water!</q></p>

<p>His fever made him careless. The next day, he just missed stepping on a yellowjaw serpent. Later, clumsy with exhaustion and walking ahead of Nictay, he stumbled and fell face-first into a pool. He had mistaken a mat of waterlilies for solid ground. When he got his feet beneath him, he stared at the logs in the pool that moved toward him. But they weren&rsquo;t logs. Crocodiles. Still he stood watching until Nictay had splashed in beside him to pull him back to solid ground.</p>

<p>His wounds no longer bled. Nonetheless, every day a little more of his strength left him, a little more of his wits drained away. When he dropped his obsidian-toothed club for the third time, Nictay picked it up and carried it herself.</p>

<p><q>Sleep,</q> Nictay encouraged him at the end of the fifth day. <q>Soon you will be among new friends.</q></p>

<p>She awoke to hear the whistling of his breath, which reassured her. But something was wrong. In the bluish phosphorescent light of the jungle, she saw black flowers blooming from Caan Cuy&rsquo;s sandaled feet and her own hand. As she puzzled at them and willed herself to alertness, she felt the wetness on her hand, the faintest tickle of a tiny tongue. A bat. She closed her hand around it and flung it away. When she rose, the bats feeding on Caan Cuy flew off.</p>

<p>That was when she heard the nearby cough of a jaguar. Was it stalking them? She spent the rest of that night wide awake, listening, knowing that a spear was little discouragement to a hungry jaguar, but unwilling to resign herself to the cat&rsquo;s mercy, unwilling to sleep. </p>

<hr/>

<p>In the morning, the rain continued, and Caan Cuy could not rise. Nictay yanked on his arms to drag him, inches at a time, through the mud to the base of a tree where he could sit up, leaning against the black trunk. She removed the leaves that bound his wounds and decided not to replace them when she saw the moldy splotches on his skin. The warrior&rsquo;s eyes were glassy. Sweat beaded on his lips.</p>

<p><q>We will rest today,</q> Nictay said, kneeling beside him.</p>

<p>Caan Cuy grinned at her, or grimaced. It was hard to tell. He let his head drop back against the tree trunk. An ant crawled close to his eye, but he made no effort to sweep it away.</p>

<p>They were still many days from the coast. <q>I would leave you and go for help, if we were nearer.</q></p>

<p>The moon warrior shut his eyes. <q>I am dying,</q> he said.</p>

<p><q>No!</q> Nictay pinched his chest, hard. He did not flinch or open his eyes. <q>You will live!</q> But she knew that as long as they lingered in the jungle rains, he would only get weaker. <q>Do you hear?</q> she shouted very close to his ear. <q>You will not die! I need you!</q> But what would he care about what she or her village needed? <q>You will not die!</q></p>

<p>Caan Cuy did not move. He made no sound.</p>

<p><q>I am a princess!</q> she shouted. <q>Great honors await you!</q> She shook him. <q>I forbid you to die!</q></p>

<p>Laughter. Nictay held herself very still. She heard a woman&rsquo;s laughter nearby. Where was it coming from? Nictay looked around. She saw nothing but leaves and vines. The voice seemed to come from in front as much as behind, from the left as much as the right, below as much as above.</p>

<p>The shells of Nictay&rsquo;s necklace rattled as she jumped to her feet. <q>Who&rsquo;s there? Show yourself!</q></p>

<p>The laughter continued, then ceased. <q>Who am I?</q> asked a womanly voice, neither young nor old. <q>Why do you not tell me instead who you are. Who trespasses at my front door?</q></p>

<p>Trespass? Front door? There was nothing here but dense jungle, as far as Nictay could tell. But if she had truly trespassed, then a show of righteous confidence might be best. Nictay stood up straight. <q>I am the Princess Nictay,</q> she said. She remembered what Caan Cuy had called her. Shell Woman. <q>Princess Nictay of the Shell Woman clan,</q> she elaborated. <q>If you have aid to offer, I would thank you to show yourself and offer it. If not, I would thank you to leave us.</q></p>

<p><q>Ah, a princess,</q> said the voice. <q>But why is your head shaped like a commoner&rsquo;s? You don&rsquo;t have the look of nobility.</q></p>

<p><q>Among my people,</q> Nictay said, <q>no mother shapes her child&rsquo;s head.</q> That much, at least, was true. Nictay&rsquo;s village was small. There were no nobles among them.</p>

<p><q>And this man?</q> asked the voice. <q>Why does his head have a noble shape?</q></p>

<p><q>He was once from a band of foreigners who have been adopted into my clan.</q></p>

<p><q>Why do you forbid him even the respite of death?</q></p>

<p><q>He is a great fighter,</q> Nictay said, then added, <q>He is my general. I need him. He is Nacom Caan Cuy, leader of the shark warriors, captor of men, slayer of enemies.</q></p>

<p><q>Yet <i>you</i> carry the war club.</q></p>

<p><q>Women are warriors among my people,</q> Nictay invented. <q>We are captors of souls on the battlefield as well as in our houses. We know the pains of both battle and childbirth.</q></p>

<p><q>I had not known there were such people,</q> said the voice with a touch of mockery.</p>

<p><q>Not heard of us? Not heard of the &hellip; the Highlands People? We are the greatest rivals to the Middle People. We are their closest enemy, and we are their match. Or haven&rsquo;t you heard of the Middle People, either?</q></p>

<p><q>I know about them,</q> said the voice. The jungle around Nictay had been dark already, but now the gloom deepened. <q>I know about the Middle People. But you Highlands People—</q> There was mirth in the voice. <q>—you were unknown to me. Until now.</q> Nictay felt the ground tremble. The tree trunk that Caan Cuy was propped against seemed to swell, then flatten out against Caan Cuy&rsquo;s back. The high canopy overhead receded, as if the whole jungle were growing taller, as if the sky were receding, or as if the ground where Nictay stood were sinking. Vines and ferns shrank back into the ground, leaving it barren.</p>

<p><q>What is happening?</q></p>

<p>The voice gave no answer. Nictay was sure now that she was dropping, that the ground where she stood was sinking deep into the earth. The last gray light dimmed to blackness, and still the ground trembled. When it stopped, the air was still. No rain fell. No insects churred. No night birds sang. And the blackness was absolute, without the blue phosphorescent glow of decaying wood or the green sparks of fireflies.</p>

<p>Caan Cuy breathed. Nictay heard her own heart beating. That was all.</p>

<p>Nictay knew now that the voice had been the voice of a goddess. She knew she should have spoken with more respect. Honesty would have served better than lies, though now that she had told such an inventive lie, she could hardly take it back. The goddess had seemed amused by what Nictay had said, and the truth now might anger her. If she was not already angry. Who can guess at the thoughts of the gods?</p>

<p><q>Lady,</q> Nictay said, kneeling though she didn&rsquo;t know if even a goddess could see in such gloom. In utter blackness, even a jaguar might be blind. <q>Lady, if I have given some offense, I am sorry. I did not know you. I did not understand your nature.</q> Her voice echoed.</p>

<p>No answer came.</p>

<p>The ground under Nictay&rsquo;s knees was hard. She felt it with her fingertips, rapped it with her knuckles. It was not mud, or even hard-packed earth, but cold unyielding stone. <q>Lady,</q> Nictay said, <q>if it is shelter that you grant us, I thank you.</q></p>

<p>Again, silence.</p>

<p>Nictay had carried no fire, or any means to start one. And now even if she could strike a spark, what could she use for fuel?</p>

<p>She stood. She waved Caan Cuy&rsquo;s club overhead. The ceiling, if there was one, was out of reach. Was this a cave? There might be drop-offs that she couldn&rsquo;t see. She inched forward, tapping the stone floors with her toes before she shifted her weight. She waved the club before her, flinching when at last it grazed something solid. A wall. She felt it with her other hand. The wall was flat, with regular seams where great blocks of stone fit together. It was a made wall. This was not a cave, but a stone house or temple like the city peoples built.</p>

<p>Gingerly, she felt her way along the wall. It extended for a long distance without interruption, and when Nictay could no longer hear Caan Cuy&rsquo;s breathing, she went back to him.</p>

<p><q>Caan Cuy?</q> She found his form in the blackness and nudged him. He did not stir, but his breathing was regular and strong. She groped for the water gourd, poured a few drops past his lips, then groped about again. There was another wall opposite the first. She followed it in both directions, returning again when she could no longer hear Caan Cuy&rsquo;s whistling breath.</p>

<p>She went back to him once more, tried again to rouse him. He groaned but did not awaken. She felt his neck. The fever had broken. Now if they did not die of thirst or starvation, he might live after all. She sat beside him in the blackness. At least here she did not think there were bats or jaguars. Here she might sleep in peace. </p>

<hr/>

<p>She dreamed many times of waking, of taking a narrow stairway back to the surface of the world. Then she woke to find herself still in the darkness. Or did she dream that, too? Were all her awakenings also dreams? At last she opened her eyes to orange light. Flames burned steadily against the high walls, far above her. She moved, and felt stiff as if from a week of sleeping. Her eyes were so dry, so crusted with sleep that it hurt to blink. Her tongue felt swollen, her throat papery. The pressure of her bladder was so painful, though, that she didn&rsquo;t need to thump her breastbone to see if she were truly awake. She exhaled what would have been a groan if her throat were not so dry, and she sat up.</p>

<p><q>There&rsquo;s water,</q> said Caan Cuy. He was sitting with his back to the wall. Light danced in his dark eyes. <q>And food.</q></p>

<p>She looked to where he pointed. Three water jugs and two bowls of fruit were against the wall. There were breadnuts, too, and palm hearts. Next to these was a shallow basin for washing. There was even a chamber pot.</p>

<p><q>Someone&rsquo;s looking out for us,</q> Caan Cuy said. <q>But who? Where are we? I don&rsquo;t remember coming here.</q></p>

<p>Nictay held her hand up to silence him. She drank from one of the jars, then took the pot down the corridor, beyond where the last flames curled up from the walls. In the half-darkness, she relieved herself. Leaving the pot behind, she returned to Caan Cuy, knelt beside the basin, and washed her shaking hands. She tore the yellow rind of a guava with her teeth and swallowed the pink flesh. She devoured a second one. A third. Then she sighed, far from satisfied, but no longer desperate. She looked at Caan Cuy. <q>We are guests,</q> she said. <q>Or prisoners. I do not know which.</q> She told him how they had come there, though she did not mention how she had lied to the goddess.</p>

<p><q>I might have guessed a Power&rsquo;s hand was in this,</q> Caan Cuy said. <q>Those are no ordinary lamps.</q> He nodded toward the flames that curled out from the walls. <q>I see no wick, no channel for oil. The stone itself seems to burn.</q></p>

<p><q>You seem &hellip; better.</q></p>

<p><q>I am healed.</q> He slapped the scars where his wounds had been. <q>We slept a long time. And she restored my strength. She knit my wounds.</q> He looked at the walls. They seemed to rise forever. The ceiling was so high that the orange glow of the flames did not reach it, if there were a ceiling at all. <q>What can she want from us?</q></p>

<p><q>So very little,</q> said a voice that seemed to emerge from the walls.</p>

<p>Caan Cuy sat up very straight. Nictay looked around, though naturally the goddess did not reveal herself. <q>I desire only that you should entertain me. Princess, you say that women are warriors as much as the men among the Highland People.</q></p>

<p>Nictay exchanged a glance with Caan Cuy. <q>That is what I told you, Lady.</q></p>

<p>Caan Cuy frowned.</p>

<p><q>And if you are such close neighbors to the Middle People, you must surely play the ball game as they do.</q></p>

<p>Nictay had seen the ball courts of the Middle People. The game they played there was known, in different forms, to all the city peoples. She nodded, though she had never played the game herself, nor heard of any woman who did.</p>

<p><q>And your general? Speak to me, Nacom Caan Cuy of the Shell Clan.</q></p>

<p><q>I am of the Swallow Clan,</q> said Caan Cuy.</p>

<p><q>You <i>were</i> of that clan,</q> Nictay said, <q>until my people adopted you.</q></p>

<p>Caan Cuy considered her, eyes narrowed.</p>

<p><q>I play the ball game,</q> he said.</p>

<p><q>Then you both shall play for me,</q> said the voice of the Power. <q>You will play to the sacred count. Each point shall add a day, beginning with the day after One Deer. The first player to rest again on One Deer shall return home to the city of the Highland People&hellip;.</q></p>

<p><q>The city of Highland People?</q> Caan Cuy said. <q>I have never heard of such a place!</q></p>

<p>Nictay pleaded with her eyes, but the Moon warrior said, <q>Lady, when I win, you must return me to the Moon city. That is my home.</q></p>

<p>After a moment, the voice said, <q>And you, <i>Princess</i> Nictay. What is your true home? For there are no Highland People, no great rivals to the Middle People. And you are no noble. Where, truly, are you from?</q></p>

<p>Nictay bowed her head. <q>From a village by the sea. It is called Kana&rsquo;s Place.</q></p>

<p><q>Did you think you could deceive me? I am the first born of earth and sky. My ear is everywhere. There are no peoples I have not heard of. You have never stepped into a ball court, have you? But you are in one now, and you play for your life.</q> At these words, the corridor changed shape, growing wider where they stood. Walls formed at either end, with smaller chambers perpendicular to the first: an I-shaped court. <q>Choose your ends,</q> said the voice. <q>Then prepare. The winner returns home. The loser dies to honor me.</q></p>

<p>Caan Cuy considered the court for a moment, then walked to one end. Nictay went to the opposite end. In the smaller, back-court chamber, she found leather guards for her forearms and shins. She tied them on, not certain that she was doing it right, and remembered what she could of the rules. They traded serves. The served ball must bounce on the server&rsquo;s own side no more than once&hellip;</p>

<p>She tied on the yoke that would protect her hips. Her grandmother had been right about lies. But how could Nictay have done otherwise? Would she have lied to a goddess, knowing she was a goddess? Of course not! She would not have lied to anyone at all if honest appeals could have done her any good in foreign lands. She had been a powerless woman among a powerless people. She&rsquo;d been using her wits because her wits were all she had.</p>

<p>What were the chances that she could beat a warrior who had practiced at this game? How could she use her wits in a game that depended instead on strength?</p>

<p>The voice of the goddess said, <q>From One Deer, I advance you both to Two Yellow. The rest of the points you must earn. Begin!</q></p>

<p>Nictay strode to her side of the court. Caan Cuy stood in his back chamber. He held a ball. He said, <q>I am grateful to you, Shell Woman, for saving me. I give you my thanks. But we are enemies now.</q></p>

<p><q>I want to live as much as you do,</q> Nictay said. <q>But we are not enemies.</q></p>

<p><q>Begin!</q> said the goddess.</p>

<p>Caan Cuy threw the ball. It bounced in his court, in Nictay&rsquo;s court, and skipped toward the back chamber. Nictay lunged at it, swinging her arm through the empty air. As she landed, she knocked over a marker stone. The ball bounced into the back chamber.</p>

<p><q>A point for the chamber and a point for the stone,</q> said the goddess. <q>Caan Cuy&rsquo;s count is Four Dog.</q></p>

<p>Nictay got up slowly, rubbing her shoulder. She returned the marker stone to its position and retrieved the ash-colored rubber ball. She squeezed it in her hand. How hard must she throw it to get it to bounce in the right way?</p>

<p>Nictay threw. The ball bounced twice on her own side.</p>

<p><q>Caan Cuy&rsquo;s count is Five Monkey,</q> said the goddess. <q>Nictay remains at Two Yellow.</q> </p>

<hr/>

<p>By the time Nictay made her first successful serve, Caan Cuy&rsquo;s score had run the course of twenty day names and stood at Eight Deer. On the rare occasions when she returned the ball, Caan Cuy always knocked it back to her side where it often died before she could reach it. He never ran into his own marker stones. Nictay, on the other hand, concentrated so hard on returns that she often knocked her own stones down. Caan Cuy even scored by hitting her marker stones with the ball. By the time she got one serve past him to advance to Three Thunder, he had run through the twenty day names again, resting on Two Deer and Nine Deer on the way to One Tooth.</p>

<p>At this rate, he would cycle through the 260 sacred days before Nictay had even reached 13 Rain.</p>

<p>It was hot. Nictay&rsquo;s skin was slippery under the leather guards. Her throat burned.</p>

<p>When her turn came to serve, she held the ball.</p>

<p><q>Throw,</q> said the goddess.</p>

<p><q>I thirst.</q></p>

<p><q>Warriors do not stop to drink in the midst of battle,</q> the goddess chided.</p>

<p><q>And we fight a battle through a year of day names. Would you keep us from resting through a whole year? Give us drink.</q></p>

<p><q>Throw.</q></p>

<p><q>He scores two and three points at a time. Is the outcome in question? Only let me slake my thirst before I die.</q></p>

<p>From his side, Caan Cuy called out, <q>No food, no drink, no rest until the game rests again at One Deer. That is the nature of the game.</q></p>

<p><q>Throw,</q> said the goddess. <q>Thirst will drive you to finish the game. March to your water jug, warrior, though there is death at its bottom. Throw.</q></p>

<p>So Nictay threw. Caan Cuy returned with his hip. Nictay ran to meet the ball, tripped on a marker, and struck the ball with her hand. <q>A point for touching with the hand. A point for the marker. From One Tooth, Caan Cuy leaps to Three Jaguar.</q></p>

<p>Then Nictay saw it, the way out of this game. And she laughed bitterly, for it was a dangerous way, one that the goddess had surely understood from the start. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Nictay played a little better as the game continued. She became more aware of the placement of the marker stones, and more of the balls she slapped with her hips or kicked with her shins went where she wanted them to go. She had advanced all the way to Six Dog when Caan Cuy scored the point that brought him to One Jaguar and began the final count toward One Deer. He scored the next point, then the next.</p>

<p>It was Caan Cuy&rsquo;s turn to serve. The Nacom had not spoken since many serves ago. Now he said, <q>I cannot lose, Nictay, yet you continue to play with determination. You are a proud woman.</q></p>

<p><q>She is a liar,</q> said the voice of the goddess.</p>

<p><q>I knew that from the start,</q> said Caan Cuy. <q>But I salute her even so.</q> And he bowed to Nictay.</p>

<p><q>You say you cannot lose,</q> Nictay said. <q>Have you also considered that you cannot win? I play for my life, Caan Cuy. Do you think I will surrender it lightly?</q></p>

<p><q>It is not a matter of surrender,</q> Caan Cuy said, and served the ball. Nictay made no attempt to return it. The ball bounced in his court, in hers, and into the back chamber.</p>

<p><q>Point for Caan Cuy. He rests at Four Thought.</q></p>

<p><q>You need eleven points to rest at One Deer,</q> Nictay said. <q>I make you a gift of this one.</q> She hurled the ball hard. It passed all the way into Caan Cuy&rsquo;s back chamber, striking the wall.</p>

<p><q>Point for Caan Cuy,</q> said the goddess. <q>He rests at Five Blade.</q></p>

<p><q>Why did you do that?</q></p>

<p><q>Don&rsquo;t you understand yet, Nacom?</q> Nictay said. <q>This is the game that neither of us is meant to win. This game is for the goddess&rsquo;s pleasure, and it is a bitter delight she takes.</q></p>

<p><q>I do not understand.</q></p>

<p><q>Serve,</q> said the goddess. <q>Do you not thirst? Serve and bring the game to a close.</q></p>

<p>Caan Cuy threw the ball. Nictay rushed to meet it, caught it in her hand and kicked over a marker stone at the same time.</p>

<p><q>One point for touching, one for the stone,</q> said the goddess. <q>Caan Cuy stands at Seven Marksman.</q></p>

<p><q>A few more points,</q> Nictay said. She threw the ball into Caan Cuy&rsquo;s back chamber again. <q>That gives you Eight Lefthanded.</q></p>

<p>Caan Cuy served again. Nictay knocked over a marker stone before the ball had even come to her side, and she kicked another stone as the ball passed through her court.</p>

<p><q>One point for the back chamber, two for the stones,</q> said the goddess. <q>Caan Cuy rests at Twelve Snake.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you see it now?</q> Nictay asked. She served into the back chamber again, giving up another point. She still rested at Six Dog, not yet halfway through the count. Caan Cuy was at Thirteen Death, only a point from victory. But he couldn&rsquo;t win. <q>We play not to surpass a certain score, but to <i>rest</i> there.</q></p>

<p>Caan Cuy held the ball, considering.</p>

<p><q>It is true that I lied to you,</q> Nictay said. <q>I am no princess. But my people need a warrior like you. That much is true. I would have said anything at all to keep you from despairing, to encourage you to come with me rather than die in the jungle. I lied, but with good reason. And it is for that reason that I will not lose this game. Nor will I let you win it. I must live to return to my people. I must bring you with me.</q></p>

<p><q>That is not possible. The bargain of the goddess&hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>Serve!</q> cried the goddess&rsquo;s voice. Caan Cuy threw. His serve was good, and as it passed by, Nictay knocked over a stone.</p>

<p><q>Two points,</q> said the goddess, laughing. <q>Caan Cuy skips One Deer and rests at Two Yellow.</q></p>

<p><q>This is her game,</q> said Nictay, <q>to deny us food or drink or rest as long as we play. And how long will be play? When either of us has the power to keep the other&rsquo;s score from ever resting on One Deer, just how long will we keep this up?</q></p>

<p><q>We will play until we are too weak to play,</q> Caan Cuy said, nodding. <q>We will play until we die of thirst.</q></p>

<p><q>There is another way,</q> Nictay said. <q>But you must trust me.</q></p>

<p><q>She is a liar,</q> said the goddess. <q>You know this about her already, Nacom.</q></p>

<p><q>I must live, and I must keep you alive,</q> said Nictay. <q>Liar or not, you can trust me more than I can trust you. I need you. You do not need me.</q></p>

<p><q>Tell me,</q> said Caan Cuy. <q>I will consider.</q> </p>

<hr/>

<p>So it was that exhausted, they played on. Caan Cuy deliberately knocked over his own markers, as Nictay knocked over her own. It took a long time for them to tie the score, and all the while the voice of the goddess reminded Caan Cuy that Nictay was untrustworthy. At the same time, she told Nictay to consider whether Caan Cuy would ever go with her back to her village. Clearly, what he wanted was to return to his own people, not serve hers.</p>

<p>When the score stood at Thirteen Death for each of them, it was Nictay&rsquo;s serve. Her papery throat burned when she asked, <q>Will you trust me, Nacom Caan Cuy of the Moon People?</q></p>

<p><q>You cannot,</q> said the goddess.</p>

<p>Across the court, he met her eyes. <q>I will.</q></p>

<p><q>She is a liar.</q></p>

<p><q>And I will trust you, Caan Cuy. Just have a care. Do not trip over a stone as the ball sails by.</q></p>

<p><q>He will betray you.</q></p>

<p>He sat down. <q>Satisfied?</q></p>

<p>He was an agile man. Even from where he sat, he might jump up and topple a stone in time, giving her two points, sending her past One Deer the way she had done it to him. But she had to trust him. There was no other way.</p>

<p>She took careful aim so that she wouldn&rsquo;t strike one of his markers with the ball. She served.</p>

<p>The ball bounced in her court. In his.</p>

<p>It sailed toward the back chamber. Caan Cuy sat, arms folded.</p>

<p>Nictay knocked over one of her own stones.</p>

<p><q>A point for the chamber,</q> growled the goddess. <q>A point for the stone. Each of you rests at One Deer.</q></p>

<p><q>Water,</q> said Caan Cuy. <q>You promised.</q></p>

<p>A water jug appeared in the center of the court. Caan Cuy and Nictay met there. Each took a swallow, then Caan Cuy said, <q>Drink. Slake your thirst. You discovered the way home for both of us.</q></p>

<p><q>She did,</q> said the goddess as Nictay drank. <q>But as you ended the game in a way I did not intend, so shall I honor my pledge to you in a way that <i>you</i> did not intend.</q> And before Nictay had finished drinking, the flames in the walls died. They were in utter blackness.</p>

<p>Light, barely perceptible and gray, grew around them. Gradually, the gloom lifted and they found themselves on a hillside. Rain fell on their faces. The water jug was still in Nictay&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p><q>Your clothes!</q> Caan Cuy said. He himself was dressed as he had always been, except that he no longer wore the yoke and pads of a ball player.</p>

<p>Nictay looked down at herself. She wore a cape of red and green feathers. There were sandals on her feet, and an enormous jade pendant hung down between her breasts.</p>

<p>Caan Cuy&rsquo;s obsidian-toothed war club lay on the ground near his feet. On the ground at Nictay&rsquo;s feet was another one just like it. The rain began to slacken.</p>

<p><q>Princess,</q> said a man who had been standing behind them. They both turned, startled. <q>Have we not rested enough? Your father awaits us.</q></p>

<p><q>Ahkbal?</q> said Caan Cuy. <q>My brother?</q> He stepped forward to clasp the man&rsquo;s hand. <q>You are here?</q></p>

<p>Ahkbal looked at him strangely. <q>I have never left, Nacom.</q> He peered into Caan Cuy&rsquo;s face. <q>Are you ill? Is the fever still with you?</q></p>

<p>Caan Cuy looked at Nictay, who had no assurance to offer. <q>I am—</q> Caan Cuy started. He shrugged. <q>I am all right.</q></p>

<p><q>Princess?</q> said Ahkbal.</p>

<p><q>Lead the way,</q> she said. He gave her the same strange look, but he took the lead on the mountain path that brought them to the top of a ridge. On a ledge below, Nictay saw a party of nobles standing and watching the valley below. She gasped, and then looking into the valley, she froze.</p>

<p>Caan Cuy took her arm. <q>What?</q></p>

<p>She nodded at the ledge. <q>My father,</q> she said. <q>He is a fisherman, but there he stands among men of noble dress. Look at his robes! They are the clothes of a great man!</q></p>

<p><q>Of an emperor,</q> Caan Cuy agreed.</p>

<p><q>Princess?</q> said Ahkbal. <q>Is something wrong?</q></p>

<p>Nictay stood up as straight as she could. In what she hoped would sound like the tones of a princess, she said, <q>Go ahead and announce us.</q></p>

<p>He bowed and left them.</p>

<p><q>So that is what she meant,</q> Nictay said. <q>She sent us home, but not to <i>our</i> homes.</q></p>

<p><q>Some of the emperor&rsquo;s body guards are women. I know some of them. Women of the Moon city. But women never carried clubs and shields in my country!</q></p>

<p><q>Mittat!</q> Nictay said, recognizing a friend. But what was Mittat doing in the robes of a warrior?</p>

<p><q>Is this place&hellip;?</q></p>

<p><q>This is the valley of the middle people,</q> Nictay said. <q>But that city below us&hellip;</q> She looked again at the palace, the temple pyramids, the houses of nobles, the huts, the surrounding fields. <q>I don&rsquo;t know it. I never saw it before.</q></p>

<p><q>What can it be,</q> Caan Cuy said, understanding now, <q>but the city of the Highland People?</q> He pointed out onto the plain between the highland city and the island city of the Middle People. Great rows of warriors lined up to face one another. Their feathered robes and painted shields were brilliant even at this distance, even under a gray sky. <q>Flower War.</q></p>

<p><q>She gave us the home of my lie,</q> Nictay said. <q>I wanted my people to be the equals of the Middle People.</q></p>

<p><q>So it seems they are,</q> Caan Cuy said. And with bitterness, he added, <q>Now they are my people, too. And yours are mine. I see priests of the Moon city attending your father down there. Your father, the emperor. And how many of my friends and yours will die down there today, women as well as men, in this flower war of your making? In this world of your lie?</q></p>

<p>She gave him a hard look. <q>I did what I had to do for my people, Nacom Caan Cuy, my general.</q></p>

<p>He looked away from her.</p>

<p><q>Come,</q> she said. <q>We have our lives. We have our new lives.</q></p>

<p>He met her gaze again.</p>

<p><q>My father awaits us, Nacom.</q> She nodded towards the ledge where the nobles watched the flower war unfold. <q>Let us go to him. Let us discover what sort of world we have made.</q></p>

<p>She started down the path. And Caan Cuy, taking in a deep breath through his crooked nose, followed her. </p>
