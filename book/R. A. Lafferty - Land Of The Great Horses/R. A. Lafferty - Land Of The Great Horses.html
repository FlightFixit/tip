<h1>Land Of The Great Horses</h1>
<h2>by R. A. Lafferty</h2>

<hr/>

<p><i><q>They came and took our country away from us,</q> the people had always said. But nobody understood them</i>.</p>

<p>Two Englishmen, Richard Rockwell and Seruno Smith, were rolling in a terrain buggy over the Thar Desert. It was bleak, red country, more rock than sand. It looked as though the top had been stripped off it and the naked underland left uncovered.</p>

<p>They heard thunder and it puzzled them. They looked at each other, the blond Rockwell and the dark Smith. It never thundered in the whole country between New Delhi and Bahawalpur. What would this rainless North India desert have to thunder with?</p>

<p><q>Let's ride the ridges here,</q> Rockwell told Smith, and he sent the vehicle into a climb. <q>It never rains here, but once before I was caught in a draw in a country where it never rained. I nearly drowned.</q></p>

<p>It thundered again, heavy and rolling, as though to tell them that they were hearing right.</p>

<p><q>This draw is named Kuti Tavdavi—Little River,</q> Smith said darkly. <q>I wonder why.</q></p>

<p>Then he jerked back as though startled at himself.</p>

<p><q>Rockwell, why did I say that? I never saw this draw before. How did a name like that pop into my mind? But it's the low draw that would be a little river if it ever rained in this country. This land can't have significant rain. There's no high place to tip whatever moisture goes over.</q></p>

<p><q>I wonder about that every time I come,</q> said Rockwell, and raised his hand towards the shimmering heights—the Land of the Great Horses, the famous mirage. <q>If it were really there it would tip the moisture. It would make a lush savanna of all this.</q></p>

<p>They were mineral explorers doing ground minutiae on promising portions of an aerial survey. The trouble with the Thar was that it had everything—lead, zinc, antimony, copper, tin, bauxite—in barely submarginal amounts. Nowhere would the Thar pay off, but everywhere it would almost pay.</p>

<p>Now it was lightning about the heights of the mirage, and they had never seen that before. It had clouded and lowered. It was thundering in rolling waves, and there is no mirage of sound.</p>

<p><q>There is either a very large and very busy bird up there or this is rain,</q> Rockwell said.</p>

<p>And it had begun to rain, softly but steadily. It was pleasant as they chukkered along in the vehicle through the afternoon. Rain in the desert is always like a bonus.</p>

<p>Smith broke into a happy song in one of the Northwest India tongues, a tune with a ribald swing to it, though Rockwell didn't understand the words. It was full of double rhymes and vowel-packed words such as a child might make up.</p>

<p><q>How the devil do you know the tongues so well?</q> Rockwell asked. <q>I find them difficult, and I have a good linguistic background.</q></p>

<p><q>I didn't have to learn them,</q> Smith said, <q>I just had to remember them. They all cluster around the <i>boro jib</i> itself.</q></p>

<p><q>Around the what? How many of the languages do you know?</q></p>

<p><q>All of them. The Seven Sisters, they're called: Punjabi, Kashmiri, Gujarati, Marathi, Sindhi, Hindi.</q></p>

<p><q>Your Seven Sisters only number six,</q> Rockwell jibed.</p>

<p><q>There's a saying that the seventh sister ran off with a horse trader,</q> Smith said. <q>But that seventh lass is still encountered here and there around the world.</q></p>

<p>Often they stopped to survey on foot. The very color of the new rivulets was significant to the mineral men, and this was the first time they had ever seen water flow in that country. They continued on fitfully and slowly, and ate up a few muddy miles.</p>

<p>Rockwell gasped once and nearly fell off the vehicle. He had seen a total stranger riding beside him, and it shook him.</p>

<p>Then he saw that it was Smith as he had always been, and he was dumfounded by the illusion. And, soon, by something else.</p>

<p><q>Something is very wrong here,</q> Rockwell said.</p>

<p><q>Something is very right here,</q> Smith answered him, and then broke into another song in an India tongue.</p>

<p><q>We're lost,</q> Rockwell worried out loud. <q>We can't see any distance for the rain, but there shouldn't be rising ground here. It isn't mapped.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course it is,</q> Smith sang. <q>It's the Jalo Char.</q></p>

<p><q>The what? Where did you get a name like that? The map's a blank here, and the country should be.</q></p>

<p><q>Then the map is defective. Man, it's the sweetest valley in the world! It will lead us all the way up. How could the map forget it? How could we all forget it for so long?</q></p>

<p><q>Smith! What's wrong? You're pie-eyed.</q></p>

<p><q>Everything's right, I tell you. I was reborn just a minute ago. It's a coming home.</q></p>

<p><q>Smith! We're riding through green grass.</q></p>

<p><q>I love it. I could crop it like a horse.</q></p>

<p><q>That cliff, Smith! It shouldn't be that close! It's part of the mir—</q></p>

<p><q>Why, sir, that is Lolo Trusul.</q></p>

<p><q>But it's not real! It's not on any topography map!</q></p>

<p><q>Map, sir? I'm a poor <i>kalo</i> man who wouldn't know about things like that.</q></p>

<p><q>Smith! You're a qualified cartographer!</q></p>

<p><q>Does seem that I followed a trade with a name like that. But the cliff is real enough. I climbed it in my boyhood—in my other boyhood. And that yonder, sir, is Drapengoro Rez—the Grassy Mountain. And the high plateau ahead of us which we begin to climb is Diz Boro Grai—the Land of the Great Horses.</q></p>

<p>Rockwell stopped the terrain buggy and leaped off. Smith followed him in a happy daze.</p>

<p><q>Smith, you're wide-eyed crazy!</q> Rockwell gasped. <q>And what am I? We're terribly lost somehow. Smith, look at the log chart and the bearings recorder!</q></p>

<p><q>Log chart, sir? I'm a poor <i>kalo</i> man who wouldn't know—</q></p>

<p><q>Damn you, Smith, you <i>made</i> these instruments. If they're correct we're seven hundred feet too high and have been climbing for ten miles into a highland that's supposed to be part of a mirage. These cliffs can't be here. We can't be here. Smith!</q></p>

<p>But Seruno Smith had ambled off like a crazy man.</p>

<p><q>Smith, where are you trotting off to? Can't you hear me?</q></p>

<p><q>You call to me, sir?</q> asked Smith. <q>And by such a name?</q></p>

<p><q>Are the two of us as crazy as the country?</q> Rockwell moaned. <q>I've worked with you for three years. Isn't your name Smith?</q></p>

<p><q>Why, yes, sir, I guess it might be englished as Horse-Smith or Black-Smith. But my name is Pettalangro and I'm going home.</q></p>

<p>And the man who had been Smith started on foot up to the Land of the Great Horses.</p>

<p><q>Smith, I'm getting on the buggy and I'm going back,</q> Rockwell shouted. <q>I'm scared liverless of this country that changes. When a mirage turns solid it's time to quit. Come along now! We'll be back in Bikaner by tomorrow morning. There's a doctor there, and a whisky bar. We need one of them.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank you, sir, but I must go up to my home,</q> Smith sang out. <q>It was kind of you to give me a ride along the way.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm leaving you, Smith. One crazy man is better than two.</q></p>

<p><q><i>Ashava, Sarishan</i>,</q> Smith called a parting.</p>

<p><q>Smith, unriddle me one last thing,</q> Rockwell called, trying to find a piece of sanity to hold to. <q>What is the name of the seventh sister?</q></p>

<p><q>Deep Romany,</q> Smith sang, and he was gone up into the high plateau that had always been a mirage.</p>

<p>In an upper room on Olive Street in St. Louis, Missouri, a half-and-half couple were talking half-and-half.</p>

<p><q>The <i>rez</i> has <i>riser</i>'d,</q> the man said. <q>I can <i>sung</i> it like <i>brishindo</i>. Let's <i>jal</i>.</q></p>

<p><q>All right,</q> the wife said, <q>if you're <i>awa</i>.</q></p>

<p><q>Hell, I bet I can <i>riker</i> plenty <i>bano</i> on the <i>beda</i> we got here. I'll have <i>kakko</i> come <i>kinna</i> it <i>saro</i>.</q></p>

<p><q>With a little <i>bachi</i> we can be <i>jal</i>'d by <i>areat</i>,</q> said the wife.</p>

<p><q><i>Nashiva</i>, woman, <i>nashiva</i>!</q></p>

<p><q>All right,</q> the wife said, and she began to pack their suitcases.</p>

<p>In Camargo in the Chihuahua State of Mexico, a shade-tree mechanic sold his business for a hundred pesos and told his wife to pack up—they were leaving.</p>

<p><q>To leave now when business is so good?</q> she asked.</p>

<p><q>I only got one car to fix and I can't fix that,</q> the man said.</p>

<p><q>But if you keep it long enough, he will pay you to put it together again even if it isn't fixed. That's what he did last time. And you've a horse to shoe.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm afraid of that horse. It has come back, though. Let's go.</q></p>

<p><q>Are you sure we will be able to find it?</q></p>

<p><q>Of course I'm not sure. We will go in our wagon and our sick horse will pull it.</q></p>

<p><q>Why will we go in the wagon, when we have a car, of sorts?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't know why. But we will go in the wagon, and we will nail the old giant horseshoe up on the lintel board.</q></p>

<p>A carny in Nebraska lifted his head and smelled the air.</p>

<p><q>It's come back,</q> he said. <q>I always knew we'd know. Any other Romanies here?</q></p>

<p><q>I got a little <i>rart</i> in me,</q> said one of his fellows. <q>This <i>narvelengero dives</i> is only a two-bit carnival anyhow. We'll tell the boss to shove it up his <i>chev</i> and we'll be gone.</q></p>

<p>In Tulsa, a used-car dealer named Gypsy Red announced the hottest sale on the row:</p>

<p><q>Everything for nothing! I'm leaving. Pick up the papers and drive them off. Nine new heaps and thirty good ones. All free.</q></p>

<p><q>You think we're crazy?</q> the people asked. <q>There's a catch.</q></p>

<p>Red put the papers for all the cars on the ground and put a brick on top of them. He got in the worst car on the lot and drove it off forever.</p>

<p><q>All free,</q> he sang out as he drove off. <q>Pick up the papers and drive the cars away.</q></p>

<p>They're still there. You think people are crazy to fall for something like that that probably has a catch to it?</p>

<p>In Galveston a barmaid named Margaret was asking merchant seamen how best to get passage to Karachi.</p>

<p><q>Why Karachi?</q> one of them asked her.</p>

<p><q>I thought it would be the nearest big port,</q> she said. <q>It's come back, you know.</q></p>

<p><q>I kind of felt this morning it had come back,</q> he said. <q>I'm a <i>chal</i> myself. Sure, we'll find something going that way.</q></p>

<p>In thousands of places fawney-men and dukkerin-women, kakki-baskros and hegedusies, clowns and commission men, Counts of Condom and Dukes of Little Egypt <i>parvel'd</i> in their chips and got ready to roll.</p>

<p>Men and families made sudden decisions in every country. <i>Athinganoi</i> gathered in the hills above Salonika in Greece and were joined by brothers from Serbia and Albania and the Rhodope Hills of Bulgaria. <i>Zingari</i> of North Italy gathered around Pavia and began to roll towards Genoa to take ship. <i>Boemios</i> of Portugal came down to Porto and Lisbon. <i>Gitanos</i> of Andalusia and all southern Spain came to Sanlúcar and Málaga. <i>Zigeuner</i> from Thuringia and Hanover thronged to Hamburg to find ocean passage. <i>Gioboga</i> and their mixed-blood <i>Shelta</i> cousins from every <i>cnoc</i> and <i>coill</i> of Ireland found boats at Dublin and Limerick and Bantry.</p>

<p>From deeper Europe, <i>Tsigani</i> began to travel overland eastward. The people were going from two hundred ports of every continent and over a thousand highroads—many of them long forgotten.</p>

<p>Balauros, Kalo, Manusch, Melelo, Tsigani, Moro, Romani, Flamenco, Sinto, Cicara, the many-named people was traveling in its thousands. The <i>Romani Rai</i> was moving.</p>

<p>Two million Gypsies of the world were going home.</p>

<p>At the Institute, Gregory Smirnov was talking to his friends and associates.</p>

<p><q>You remember the thesis I presented several years ago,</q> he said, <q>that, a little over a thousand years ago, Outer Visitors came down to Earth and took a sliver of our Earth away with them. All of you found the proposition comical, but I arrived at my conclusion by isostatic and eustatic analysis carried out minutely. There is no doubt that it happened.</q></p>

<p><q>One of our slivers is missing,</q> said Aloysius Shiplap. <q>You guessed the sliver taken at about ten thousand square miles area and no more than a mile thick at its greatest. You said you thought they wanted to run this sliver from our Earth through their laboratories as a sample. Do you have something new on our missing sliver?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm closing the inquiry,</q> Gregory said. <q>They've brought it back.</q></p>

<p>It was simple really, <i>jekvasteskero</i>, Gypsy-simple. It is the <i>gadjo</i>, the non-Gypsies of the world, who give complicated answers to simple things.</p>

<p><q>They came and took our country away from us,</q> the Gypsies had always said, and that is what had happened.</p>

<p>The Outer Visitors had run a slip under it, rocked it gently to rid it of nervous fauna, and then taken it away for study. For a marker, they left an immaterial simulacrum of that high country as we ourselves sometimes set name or picture tags to show where an object will be set later. This simulacrum was often seen by humans as a mirage.</p>

<p>The Outer Visitors also set simulacra in the minds of the superior fauna that fled from the moving land. This would be a homing instinct, inhibiting permanent settlement anywhere until the time should come for the resettlement; entwined with this instinct were certain premonitions, fortune-showings, and understandings.</p>

<p>Now the Visitors brought the slice of land back, and its old fauna homed in on it.</p>

<p><q>What will the—ah—patronizing smile on my part—Outer Visitors do now, Gregory?</q> Aloysius Shiplap asked back at the Institute.</p>

<p><q>Why, take another sliver of our Earth to study, I suppose, Aloysius,</q> Gregory Smirnov said.</p>

<p>Low-intensity earthquakes rocked the Los Angeles area for three days. The entire area was evacuated of people. Then there was a great whistle blast from the sky as if to say, <q>All ashore that's going ashore.</q></p>

<p>Then the surface to some little depth and all its superstructure was taken away. It was gone. And then it was quickly forgotten.</p>

<p>From the TWENTY-SECOND-CENTURY COMPREHENSIVE ENCYCLOPEDIA, Vol. 1, page 389—</p>

<p>ANGELENOS. (<i>See also</i> Automobile Gypsies and Prune Pickers.) A mixed ethnic group of unknown origin, much given to wandering in automobiles. It is predicted that they will be the last users of this vehicle, and several archaic chrome-burdened models are still produced for their market. These people are not beggars; many of them are of superior intelligence. They often set up in business, usually as real estate dealers, gamblers, confidence men, managers of mail-order diploma mills, and promoters of one sort or other. They seldom remain long in one location.</p>

<p>Their pastimes are curious. They drive for hours and days on old and seldom-used cloverleafs and freeways. It has been said that a majority of the Angelenos are narcotics users, but Harold Freelove (who lived for some months as an Angeleno) has proved this false. What they inhale at their frolics (smog-crocks) is a black smoke of carbon and petroleum waste laced with monoxide. Its purpose is not clear.</p>

<p>The religion of the Angelenos is a mixture of old cults with a very strong eschatological element. The Paradise Motif is represented by reference to a mystic <q>Sunset Boulevard.</q> The language of the Angelenos is a colorful and racy argot. Their account of their origin is vague:</p>

<p><q>They came and took our dizz away from us,</q> they say.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Afterword:</p>

<p>We are all cousins. I don't believe in reincarnation, but the only system of reincarnation that satisfies justice is that every being should become successively (or sometimes simultaneously) every other being. This would take a few billion lifetimes; the writer with a feel for the Kindred tries to do it in one.</p>

<p>We are all Romanies, as in the parable here, and we have a built-in homing to and remembrance of a woollier and more excellent place, a reality that masquerades as a mirage. Whether the more excellent place is here or heretofore or hereafter, I don't know, or whether it will be our immediate world when it is sufficiently animated; but there is an intuition about it which sometimes passes through the whole community. There is, or there ought to be, these shimmering heights; and they belong to us. Controversy (or polarity) is between ourselves as individuals and as members of the incandescent species, confronted with the eschatological thing. I'd express it more intelligently if I knew how.</p>

<p>But I didn't write the story to point up this notion, but to drop a name. There <i>is</i> a Margaret the barmaid—not the one in the story, of course (for we have to abide by the disavowal <q>Any resemblance to actual persons living or dead is purely coincidental</q>), but another of the same name—and she is a Romany. <q>Put my name in a story, just Margaret the barmaid,</q> she told me. <q>I don't care what, even name a dog that.</q> <q>But you won't know it,</q> I said, <q>you don't read anything, and none of the people you run around with do.</q> <q>I will know it exactly,</q> she said, <q>when someone else reads it someday, when they come to the name Margaret the barmaid. I know things like that.</q></p>

<p>Not from me, but from someone who reads it here, Margaret will receive the intuition, and both parties will know it. <q>Hey, the old bat did it,</q> Margaret will say. I don't know what the reader-sender caught in the middle will say or think.</p>

<p>I am pleased to be a member of this august though sometimes raffish company playing here in this production. It has an air of excellence, and some of it will rub off on me. We are, all of us, Counts of Con-dom and Dukes of Little Egypt.</p>
