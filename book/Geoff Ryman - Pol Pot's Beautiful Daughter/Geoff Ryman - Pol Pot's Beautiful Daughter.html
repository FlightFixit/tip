<h1>Pol Pot&rsquo;s Beautiful Daughter</h1>
<h2>by Geoff Ryman</h2>

<p><span class="start">In Cambodia people are</span> used to ghosts. Ghosts buy newspapers. They own property.</p>

<p>A few years ago, spirits owned a house in Phnom Penh, at the Tra Bek end of Monivong Boulevard. Khmer Rouge had murdered the whole family and there was no one left alive to inherit it. People cycled past the building, leaving it boarded up. Sounds of weeping came from inside.</p>

<p>Then a professional inheritor arrived from America. She&rsquo;d done her research and could claim to be the last surviving relative of no fewer than three families. She immediately sold the house to a Chinese businessman, who turned the ground floor into a photocopying shop.</p>

<p>The copiers began to print pictures of the original owners.</p>

<p>At first, single black and white photos turned up in the copied dossiers of aid workers or government officials. The father of the murdered family had been a lawyer. He stared fiercely out of the photos as if demanding something. In other photocopies, his beautiful daughters forlornly hugged each other. The background was hazy like fog.</p>

<p>One night the owner heard a noise and trundled downstairs to find all five photocopiers printing one picture after another of faces: young college men, old women, parents with a string of babies, or government soldiers in uniform. He pushed the big green off-buttons. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>He pulled out all the plugs, but the machines kept grinding out face after face. Women in beehive hairdos or clever children with glasses looked wistfully out of the photocopies. They seemed to be dreaming of home in the 1960s, when Phnom Penh was the most beautiful city in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>News spread. People began to visit the shop to identify lost relatives. Women would cry, <q>That&rsquo;s my mother! I didn&rsquo;t have a photograph!</q> They would weep and press the flimsy A4 sheets to their breasts. The paper went limp from tears and humidity as if it too were crying.</p>

<p>Soon, a throng began to gather outside the shop every morning to view the latest batch of faces. In desperation, the owner announced that each morning&rsquo;s harvest would be delivered direct to <i>The Truth,</i> a magazine of remembrance.</p>

<p>Then one morning he tried to open the house-door to the shop and found it blocked. He went &rsquo;round to the front of the building and rolled open the metal shutters.</p>

<p>The shop was packed from floor to ceiling with photocopies. The ground floor had no windows &mdash; the room had been filled from the inside. The owner pulled out a sheet of paper and saw himself on the ground, his head beaten in by a hoe. The same image was on every single page.</p>

<p>He buried the photocopiers and sold the house at once. The new owner liked its haunted reputation; it kept people away. The FOR SALE sign was left hanging from the second floor.</p>

<p>In a sense, the house had been bought by another ghost.</p>

<p>This is a completely untrue story about someone who must exist.</p>

<br/>

<p><span class="small-caps">Pol Pot&rsquo;s only child,</span> a daughter, was born in 1986. Her name was Sith, and in 2004, she was eighteen years old.</p>

<p>Sith liked air conditioning and luxury automobiles.</p>

<p>Her hair was dressed in cornrows and she had a spiky piercing above one eye. Her jeans were elaborately slashed and embroidered. Her pink T-shirts bore slogans in English: CARE KOOKY. PINK MOLL.</p>

<p>Sith lived like a woman on Thai television, doing as she pleased in lip-gloss and Sun-silked hair. Nine simple rules helped her avoid all unpleasantness.</p>

<br/>

<ol>
<li>Never think about the past or politics.</li>

<li>Ignore ghosts. They cannot hurt you.</li>

<li>Do not go to school. Hire tutors. Don&rsquo;t
do homework. It is disturbing.</li>

<li>Always be driven everywhere in either the
Mercedes or the BMW.</li>

<li>Avoid all well-dressed Cambodian boys. They are
the sons of the estimated 250,000 new generals created by the regime.
Their sons can behave with impunity.</li>

<li>Avoid all men with potbellies. They eat too
well and therefore must be corrupt.</li>

<li>Avoid anyone who drives a Toyota Viva or Honda
Dream motorcycle.</li>

<li>Don&rsquo;t answer letters or phone calls.</li>

<li>Never make any friends.</li>
</ol>

<br/>

<p>There was also a tenth rule, but that went without saying.</p>

<p>Rotten fruit rinds and black mud never stained Sith&rsquo;s designer sports shoes. Disabled beggars never asked her for alms. Her life began yesterday, which was effectively the same as today.</p>

<p>Every day, her driver took her to the new Soriya Market. It was almost the only place that Sith went. The color of silver, Soriya rose up in many floors to a round glass dome.</p>

<p>Sith preferred the 142nd Street entrance. Its green awning made everyone look as if they were made of jade. The doorway went directly into the ice-cold jewelry rotunda with its floor of polished black and white stone. The individual stalls were hung with glittering necklaces and earrings.</p>

<p>Sith liked tiny shiny things that had no memory. She hated politics. She refused to listen to the news. Pol Pot&rsquo;s beautiful daughter wished the current leadership would behave decently, like her dad always did. To her.</p>

<p>She remembered the sound of her father&rsquo;s gentle voice. She remembered sitting on his lap in a forest enclosure, being bitten by mosquitoes. Memories of malaria had sunk into her very bones. She now associated forests with nausea, fevers, and pain. A flicker of tree-shade on her skin made her want to throw up and the odor of soil or fallen leaves made her gag. She had never been to Angkor Wat. She read nothing.</p>

<p>Sith shopped. Her driver was paid by the government and always carried an AK-47, but his wife, the housekeeper, had no idea who Sith was. The house was full of swept marble, polished teak furniture, i-Pods, X-boxes, and plasma screens.</p>

<p>Please remember that every word of this story is a lie. Pol Pot was no doubt a dedicated communist who made no money from ruling Cambodia. Nevertheless, a hefty allowance arrived for Sith every month from an account in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Nothing touched Sith, until she fell in love with the salesman at Hello Phones.</p>

<p>Cambodian readers may know that in 2004 there was no mobile phone shop in Soriya Market. However, there was a branch of Hello Phone Cards that had a round blue sales counter with orange trim. This shop looked like that.</p>

<p>Every day Sith bought or exchanged a mobile phone there. She would sit and flick her hair at the salesman.</p>

<p>His name was Dara, which means Star. Dara knew about deals on call prices, sim cards, and the new phones that showed videos. He could get her any call tone she liked.</p>

<p>Talking to Dara broke none of Sith&rsquo;s rules. He wasn&rsquo;t fat, nor was he well dressed, and far from being a teenager, he was a comfortably mature twenty-four years old.</p>

<p>One day, Dara chuckled and said, <q>As a friend I advise you, you don&rsquo;t need another mobile phone.</q></p>

<p>Sith wrinkled her nose. <q>I don&rsquo;t like this one anymore. It&rsquo;s blue. I want something more feminine. But not frilly. And it should have better sound quality.</q></p>

<p><q>Okay, but you could save your money and buy some more nice clothes.</q></p>

<p>Pol Pot&rsquo;s beautiful daughter lowered her chin, which she knew made her neck look long and graceful. <q>Do you like my clothes?</q></p>

<p><q>Why ask me?</q></p>

<p>She shrugged. <q>I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s good to check out your look.</q></p>

<p>Dara nodded. <q>You look cool. What does your sister say?</q></p>

<p>Sith let him know she had no family. <q>Ah,</q> he said and quickly changed the subject. That was terrific. Secrecy and sympathy in one easy movement.</p>

<p>Sith came back the next day and said that she&rsquo;d decided that the rose-colored phone was too feminine. Dara laughed aloud and his eyes sparkled. Sith had come late in the morning just so that he could ask this question. <q>Are you hungry? Do you want to meet for lunch?</q></p>

<p>Would he think she was cheap if she said yes? Would he say she was snobby if she said no?</p>

<p><q>Just so long as we eat in Soriya Market,</q> she said.</p>

<p>She was torn between BBWorld Burgers and Lucky7. BBWorld was big, round, and just two floors down from the dome. Lucky7 Burgers was part of the Lucky Supermarket, such a good store that a tiny jar of Maxwell House cost US$2.40.</p>

<p>They decided on BBWorld. It was full of light and they could see the town spread out through the wide clean windows. Sith sat in silence.</p>

<p>Pol Pot&rsquo;s daughter had nothing to say unless she was buying something.</p>

<p>Or rather she had only one thing to say, but she must never say it.</p>

<p>Dara did all the talking. He talked about how the guys on the third floor could get him a deal on original copies of <i>Grand Theft Auto.</i> He hinted that he could get Sith discounts from Bsfashion, the spotlit modern shop one floor down.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped. <q>You don&rsquo;t need to be afraid of me, you know.</q> He said it in a kindly, grownup voice. <q>I can see, you&rsquo;re a properly brought up girl. I like that. It&rsquo;s nice.</q></p>

<p>Sith still couldn&rsquo;t find anything to say. She could only nod. She wanted to run away.</p>

<p><q>Would you like to go to K-Four?</q></p>

<p>K-Four, the big electronics shop, stocked all the reliable brand names: Hitachi, Sony, Panasonic, Philips, or Denon. It was so expensive that almost nobody shopped there, which is why Sith liked it. A crowd of people stood outside and stared through the window at a huge home entertainment center showing a DVD of <i>Ice Age.</i> On the screen, a little animal was being chased by a glacier. It was so beautiful!</p>

<p>Sith finally found something to say. <q>If I had one of those, I would never need to leave the house.</q></p>

<p>Dara looked at her sideways and decided to laugh.</p>

<p>The next day Sith told him that all the phones she had were too big. Did he have one that she could wear around her neck like jewelry?</p>

<p>This time they went to Lucky7 Burgers, and sat across from the Revlon counter. They watched boys having their hair layered by Revlon&rsquo;s natural beauty specialists.</p>

<p>Dara told her more about himself. His father had died in the wars. His family now lived in the country. Sith&rsquo;s Coca-Cola suddenly tasted of antimalarial drugs.</p>

<p><q>But&hellip;you don&rsquo;t want to <i>live</i> in the country,</q> she said.</p>

<p><q>No. I have to live in Phnom Penh to make money. But my folks are good country people. Modest.</q> He smiled, embarrassed.</p>

<p><i>They&rsquo;ll have hens and a cousin who shimmies up coconut trees. There will be trees all around but no shops anywhere. The earth will smell.</i></p>

<p>Sith couldn&rsquo;t finish her drink. She sighed and smiled and said abruptly, <q>I&rsquo;m sorry. It&rsquo;s been cool. But I have to go.</q> She slunk sideways out of her seat as slowly as molasses.</p>

<p>Walking back into the jewelry rotunda with nothing to do, she realized that Dara would think she didn&rsquo;t like him.</p>

<p>And that made the lower part of her eyes sting.</p>

<p>She went back the next day and didn&rsquo;t even pretend to buy a mobile phone. She told Dara that she&rsquo;d left so suddenly the day before because she&rsquo;d remembered a hair appointment.</p>

<p>He said that he could see she took a lot of trouble with her hair. Then he asked her out for a movie that night.</p>

<p>Sith spent all day shopping in K-Four.</p>

<p>They met at six. Dara was so considerate that he didn&rsquo;t even suggest the horror movie. He said he wanted to see <i>Buffalo Girl Hiding</i>, a movie about a country girl who lives on a farm. Sith said with great feeling that she would prefer the horror movie.</p>

<p>The cinema on the top floor opened out directly onto the roof of Soriya. Graffiti had been scratched into the green railings. Why would people want to ruin something new and beautiful? Sith put her arm through Dara&rsquo;s and knew that they were now boyfriend and girlfriend.</p>

<p><q>Finally,</q> he said.</p>

<p><q>Finally what?</q></p>

<p><q>You&rsquo;ve done something.</q></p>

<p>They leaned on the railings and looked out over other people&rsquo;s apartments. West toward the river was a building with one huge roof terrace. Women met there to gossip. Children were playing toss-the-sandal. From this distance, Sith was enchanted.</p>

<p><q>I just love watching the children.</q></p>

<p>The movie, from Thailand, was about a woman whose face turns blue and spotty and who eats men. The blue woman was yucky, but not as scary as all the badly dubbed voices. The characters sounded possessed. It was though Thai people had been taken over by the spirits of dead Cambodians.</p>

<p>Whenever Sith got scared, she chuckled.</p>

<p>So she sat chuckling with terror. Dara thought she was laughing at a dumb movie and found such intelligence charming. He started to chuckle too. Sith thought he was as frightened as she was. Together in the dark, they took each other&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>Outside afterward, the air hung hot even in the dark and 142nd Street smelled of drains. Sith stood on tiptoe to avoid the oily deposits and castoff fish-bones.</p>

<p>Dara said, <q>I will drive you home.</q></p>

<p><q>My driver can take us,</q> said Sith, flipping open her Kermit-the-Frog mobile.</p>

<p>Her black Mercedes Benz edged to a halt, crunching old plastic bottles in the gutter. The seats were upholstered with tan leather and the driver was armed.</p>

<p>Dara&rsquo;s jaw dropped. <q>Who&hellip;<i>who</i> is your father?</q></p>

<p><q>He&rsquo;s dead.</q></p>

<p>Dara shook his head. <q>Who was he?</q></p>

<p>Normally Sith used her mother&rsquo;s family name, but that would not answer this question. Flustered, she tried to think of someone who could be her father. She knew of nobody the right age. She remembered something about a politician who had died. His name came to her and she said it in panic. <q>My father was Kol Vireakboth.</q> Had she got the name right? <q>Please don&rsquo;t tell anyone.</q></p>

<p>Dara covered his eyes. <q>We &mdash; my family, my father &mdash; we fought for the KPLA.</q></p>

<p>Sith had to stop herself asking what the KPLA was.</p>

<p>Kol Vireakboth had led a faction in the civil wars. It fought against the Khmer Rouge, the Vietnamese, the King, and corruption. It wanted a new way for Cambodia. Kol Vireakboth was a Cambodian leader who had never told a lie and or accepted a bribe.</p>

<p>Remember that this is an untrue story.</p>

<p>Dara started to back away from the car. <q>I don&rsquo;t think we should be doing this. I&rsquo;m just a villager, really.</q></p>

<p><q>That doesn&rsquo;t matter.</q></p>

<p>His eyes closed. <q>I would expect nothing less from the daughter of Kol Vireakboth.</q></p>

<p>Oh for gosh sake, she just picked the man&rsquo;s name out of the air, she didn&rsquo;t need more problems. <q>Please!</q> she said.</p>

<p>Dara sighed. <q>Okay. I said I would see you home safely. I will.</q> Inside the Mercedes, he stroked the tan leather.</p>

<p>When they arrived, he craned his neck to look up at the building. <q>Which floor are you on?</q></p>

<p><q>All of them.</q></p>

<p>Color drained from his face.</p>

<p><q>My driver will take you back,</q> she said to Dara. As the car pulled away, she stood outside the closed garage shutters, waving forlornly.</p>

<p>Then Sith panicked. Who was Kol Vireakboth? She went online and Googled. She had to read about the wars. Her skin started to creep. All those different factions swam in her head: ANS, NADK, KPR,and KPNLF. The very names seemed to come at her spoken by forgotten voices.</p>

<p>Soon she had all she could stand. She printed out Vireakboth&rsquo;s picture and decided to have it framed. In case Dara visited.</p>

<p>Kol Vireakboth had a round face and a fatherly smile. His eyes seemed to slant upward toward his nose, looking full of kindly insight. He&rsquo;d been killed by a car bomb.</p>

<p>All that night, Sith heard whispering.</p>

<p>In the morning, there was another picture of someone else in the tray of her printer.</p>

<p>A long-faced, buck-toothed woman stared out at her in black and white. Sith noted the victim&rsquo;s fashion lapses. The woman&rsquo;s hair was a mess, all frizzy. She should have had it straightened and put in some nice highlights. The woman&rsquo;s eyes drilled into her.</p>

<p><q>Can&rsquo;t touch me,</q> said Sith. She left the photo in the tray. She went to see Dara, right away, no breakfast.</p>

<p>His eyes were circled with dark flesh and his blue Hello trousers and shirt were not properly ironed.</p>

<p><q>Buy the whole shop,</q> Dara said, looking deranged. <q>The guys in K-Four just told me some girl in blue jeans walked in yesterday and bought two home theatres. One for the salon, she said, and one for the roof terrace. She paid for both of them in full and had them delivered to the far end of Monivong.</q></p>

<p>Sith sighed. <q>I&rsquo;m sending one back.</q> She hoped that sounded abstemious. <q>It looked too metallic against my curtains.</q></p>

<p>Pause.</p>

<p><q>She also bought an Aido robot dog for fifteen hundred dollars.</q></p>

<p>Sith would have preferred that Dara did not know about the dog. It was just a silly toy; it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to her that it might cost that much until she saw the bill. <q>They should not tell everyone about their customers&rsquo; business or soon they will have no customers.</q></p>

<p>Dara was looking at her as if thinking: <i>This is not just a nice sweet girl.</i></p>

<p><q>I had fun last night,</q> Sith said in a voice as thin as high clouds.</p>

<p><q>So did I.</q></p>

<p><q>We don&rsquo;t have to tell anyone about my family. Do we?</q> Sith was seriously scared of losing him.</p>

<p><q>No. But Sith, it&rsquo;s stupid. Your family, my family, we are not equals.</q></p>

<p><q>It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference.</q></p>

<p><q>You lied to me. Your family is not dead. You have famous uncles.</q></p>

<p>She did indeed &mdash; Uncle Ieng Sary, Uncle Khieu Samphan, Uncle Ta Mok. All the Pol Pot clique had been called her uncles.</p>

<p><q>I didn&rsquo;t know them that well,</q> she said. That was true, too.</p>

<p>What would she do if she couldn&rsquo;t shop in Soriya Market anymore? What would she do without Dara?</p>

<p>She begged. <q>I am not a strong person. Sometimes I think I am not a person at all. I&rsquo;m just a space.</q></p>

<p>Dara looked suddenly mean. <q>You&rsquo;re just a credit card.</q> Then his face fell. <q>I&rsquo;m sorry. That was an unkind thing to say. You are very young for your age and I&rsquo;m older than you and I should have treated you with more care.</q></p>

<p>Sith was desperate. <q>All my money would be very nice.</q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m not for sale.</q></p>

<p>He worked in a shop and would be sending money home to a fatherless family; of course he was for sale!</p>

<p>Sith had a small heart, but a big head for thinking. She knew that she had to do this delicately, like picking a flower, or she would spoil the bloom. <q>Let&rsquo;s&hellip;let&rsquo;s just go see a movie?</q></p>

<p>After all, she was beautiful and well brought up and she knew her eyes were big and round. Her tiny heart was aching.</p>

<p>This time they saw <i>Tum Teav</i>, a remake of an old movie from the 1960s. If movies were not nightmares about ghosts, then they tried to preserve the past. <i>When,</i> thought Sith, <i>will they make a movie about Cambodia&rsquo;s future?Tum Teav</i> was based on a classic tale of a young monk who falls in love with a properly brought up girl but her mother opposes the match. They commit suicide at the end, bringing a curse on their village. Sith sat through it stony-faced. <i>I am not going to be a dead heroine in a romance.</i></p>

<p>Dara offered to drive her home again and that&rsquo;s when Sith found out that he drove a Honda Dream. He proudly presented to her the gleaming motorcycle of fast young men. Sith felt backed into a corner. She&rsquo;d already offered to buy him. Showing off her car again might humiliate him.</p>

<p>So she broke rule number seven.</p>

<p>Dara hid her bag in the back and they went soaring down Monivong Boulevard at night, past homeless people, prostitutes, and chefs staggering home after work. It was late in the year, but it started to rain.</p>

<p>Sith loved it, the cool air brushing against her face, the cooler rain clinging to her eyelashes.</p>

<p>She remembered being five years old in the forest and dancing in the monsoon. She encircled Dara&rsquo;s waist to stay on the bike and suddenly found her cheek was pressed up against his back. She giggled in fear, not of the rain, but of what she felt.</p>

<p>He dropped her off at home. Inside, everything was dark except for the flickering green light on her printer. In the tray were two new photographs. One was of a child, a little boy, holding up a school prize certificate. The other was a tough, wise-looking old man, with a string of muscle down either side of his ironic, bitter smile. They looked directly at her.</p>

<p><i>They know who I am.</i></p>

<p>As she climbed the stairs to her bedroom, she heard someone sobbing, far away, as if the sound came from next door. She touched the walls of the staircase. They shivered slightly, constricting in time to the cries.</p>

<p>In her bedroom she extracted one of her many iPods from the tangle of wires and listened to <i>System of a Down,</i> as loud as she could. It helped her sleep. The sound of nu-metal guitars seemed to come roaring out of her own heart.</p>

<p>She was woken up in the sun-drenched morning by the sound of her doorbell many floors down. She heard the housekeeper Jorani call and the door open. Sith hesitated over choice of jeans and top. By the time she got downstairs she found the driver and the housemaid joking with Dara, giving him tea.</p>

<p>Like the sunshine, Dara seemed to disperse ghosts.</p>

<p><q>Hi,</q> he said. <q>It&rsquo;s my day off. I thought we could go on a motorcycle ride to the country.</q></p>

<p>But not to the country. Couldn&rsquo;t they just spend the day in Soriya? No, said Dara, there&rsquo;s lots of other places to see in Phnom Penh.</p>

<p>He drove her, twisting through back streets. How did the city get so poor? How did it get so dirty?</p>

<p>They went to a new and modern shop for CDs that was run by a record label. Dara knew all the cool new music, most of it influenced by Khmer-Americans returning from Long Beach and Compton: Sdey, Phnom Penh Bad Boys, Khmer Kid.</p>

<p>Sith bought twenty CDs.</p>

<p>They went to the National Museum and saw the beautiful Buddha-like head of King Jayavarman VII. Dara without thinking ducked and held up his hands in prayer. They had dinner in a French restaurant with candles and wine, and it was just like in a karaoke video, a boy, a girl, and her money all going out together. They saw the show at Sovanna Phum, and there was a wonderful dance piece with sampled 1940s music from an old French movie, with traditional Khmer choreography.</p>

<p>Sith went home, her heart singing, <i>Dara, Dara, Dara</i>.</p>

<p>In the bedroom, a mobile phone began to ring, over and over. <i>Call 1</i> said the screen, but gave no name or number, so the person was not on Sith&rsquo;s list of contacts.</p>

<p>She turned off the phone. It kept ringing. That&rsquo;s when she knew for certain.</p>

<p>She hid the phone in a pillow in the spare bedroom and put another pillow on top of it and then closed the door.</p>

<p>All forty-two of her mobile phones started to ring. They rang from inside closets, or from the bathroom where she had forgotten them. They rang from the roof terrace and even from inside a shoe under her bed.</p>

<p><q>I am a very stubborn girl!</q> she shouted at the spirits. <q>You do not scare me.</q></p>

<p>She turned up her iPod and finally slept.</p>

<p>As soon as the sun was up, she roused her driver, slumped deep in his hammock. <q>Come on, we&rsquo;re going to Soriya Market,</q> she said. The driver looked up at her dazed, then remembered to smile and lower his head in respect. His face fell when she showed up in the garage with all forty-two of her mobile phones in one black bag.</p>

<p>It was too early for Soriya Market to open. They drove in circles with sunrise blazing directly into their eyes. On the streets, men pushed carts like beasts of burden, or carried cascades of belts into the old Central Market. The old market was domed, art deco, the color of vomit, French. Sith never shopped there.</p>

<p><q>Maybe you should go visit your Mom,</q> said the driver. <q>You know, she loves you. Families are there for when you are in trouble.</q></p>

<p>Sith&rsquo;s mother lived in Thailand and they never spoke. Her mother&rsquo;s family kept asking for favors: money, introductions, or help with getting a job. Sith didn&rsquo;t speak to them any longer.</p>

<p><q>My family is only trouble.</q></p>

<p>The driver shut up and drove.</p>

<p>Finally Soriya opened. Sith went straight to Dara&rsquo;s shop and dumped all the phones on the blue countertop. <q>Can you take these back?</q></p>

<p><q>We only do exchanges. I can give a new phone for an old one.</q> Dara looked thoughtful. <q>Don&rsquo;t worry. Leave them here with me, I&rsquo;ll go sell them to a guy in the old market, and give you your money tomorrow.</q> He smiled in approval. <q>This is very sensible.</q></p>

<p>He passed one phone back, the one with video and email. <q>This is the best one, keep this.</q></p>

<p>Dara was so competent. Sith wanted to sink down onto him like a pillow and stay there. She sat in the shop all day, watching him work. One of the guys from the games shop upstairs asked, <q>Who is this beautiful girl?</q></p>

<p>Dara answered proudly, <q>My girlfriend.</q></p>

<p>Dara drove her back on the Dream and at the door to her house, he chuckled. <q>I don&rsquo;t want to go.</q> She pressed a finger against his naughty lips, and smiled and spun back inside from happiness.</p>

<p>She was in the ground-floor garage. She heard something like a rat scuttle. In her bag, the telephone rang. Who were these people to importune her, even if they were dead? She wrenched the mobile phone out of her bag and pushed the green button and put the phone to her ear. She waited. There was a sound like wind.</p>

<p>A child spoke to her, his voice clogged as if he was crying. <q>They tied my thumbs together.</q></p>

<p>Sith demanded. <q>How did you get my number?</q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m all alone!</q></p>

<p><q>Then ring somebody else. Someone in your family.</q></p>

<p><q>All my family are dead. I don&rsquo;t know where I am. My name is.&hellip;</q></p>

<p>Sith clicked the phone off. She opened the trunk of the car and tossed the phone inside it. Being telephoned by ghosts was so&hellip;<i>unmodern.</i> How could Cambodia become a number one country if its cell phone network was haunted?</p>

<p>She stormed up into the salon. On top of a table, the $1500, no-mess dog stared at her from out of his packaging. Sith clumped up the stairs onto the roof terrace to sleep as far away as she could from everything in the house.</p>

<p>She woke up in the dark, to hear thumping from downstairs.</p>

<p>The sound was metallic and hollow, as if someone were locked in the car. Sith turned on her iPod. Something was making the sound of the music skip. She fought the tangle of wires, and wrenched out another player, a Xen, but it too skipped, burping the sound of speaking voices into the middle of the music.</p>

<p>Had she heard a ripping sound? She pulled out the earphones, and heard something climbing the stairs.</p>

<p>A sound of light, uneven lolloping. She thought of crippled children. Frost settled over her like a heavy blanket and she could not move.</p>

<p>The robot dog came whirring up onto the terrace. It paused at the top of the stairs, its camera nose pointing at her to see, its useless eyes glowing cherry red.</p>

<p>The robot dog said in a warm, friendly voice, <q>My name is Phalla. I tried to buy my sister medicine and they killed me for it.</q></p>

<p>Sith tried to say, <q>Go away,</q> but her throat wouldn&rsquo;t open.</p>

<p>The dog tilted its head. <q>No one even knows I&rsquo;m dead. What will you do for all the people who are not mourned?</q></p>

<p>Laughter blurted out of her, and Sith saw it rise up as cold vapor into the air.</p>

<p><q>We have no one to invite us to the feast,</q> said the dog.</p>

<p>Sith giggled in terror. <q>Nothing. I can do nothing!</q> she said, shaking her head.</p>

<p><q>You laugh?</q> The dog gathered itself and jumped up into the hammock with her. It turned and lifted up its clear plastic tail and laid a genuine turd alongside Sith. Short brown hair was wound up in it, a scalp actually, and a single flat white human tooth smiled out of it.</p>

<p>Sith squawked and overturned both herself and the dog out of the hammock and onto the floor. The dog pushed its nose up against hers and began to sing an old-fashioned children&rsquo;s song about birds.</p>

<p>Something heavy huffed its way up the stairwell toward her. Sith shivered with cold on the floor and could not move. The dog went on singing in a high, sweet voice. A large shadow loomed out over the top of the staircase, and Sith gargled, swallowing laughter, trying to speak.</p>

<p><q>There was thumping in the car and no one in it,</q> said the driver.</p>

<p>Sith sagged toward the floor with relief. <q>The ghosts,</q> she said. <q>They&rsquo;re back.</q> She thrust herself to her feet. <q>We&rsquo;re getting out now. Ring the Hilton. Find out if they have rooms.</q> She kicked the toy dog down the stairs ahead of her. <q>We&rsquo;re moving now!</q></p>

<p>Together they all loaded the car, shaking. Once again, the house was left to ghosts. As they drove, the mobile phone rang over and over inside the trunk.</p>

<p>The new Hilton (which does not exist) rose up by the river across from the Department for Cults and Religious Affairs. Tall and marbled and pristine, it had crystal chandeliers and fountains, and wood and brass handles in the elevators.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night only the Bridal Suite was still available, but it had an extra parental chamber where the driver and his wife could sleep. High on the twenty-first floor, the night sparkled with lights and everything was hushed, as far away from Cambodia as it was possible to get.</p>

<p>Things were quiet after that, for a while.</p>

<p>Every day she and Dara went to movies, or went to a restaurant. They went shopping. She slipped him money and he bought himself a beautiful suit. He said, over a hamburger at Lucky7, <q>I&rsquo;ve told my mother that I&rsquo;ve met a girl.</q></p>

<p>Sith smiled and thought: and I bet you told her that I&rsquo;m rich.</p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;ve decided to live in the Hilton,</q> she told him.</p>

<p><i>Maybe we could live in the Hilton</i>. A pretty smile could hint at that.</p>

<p>The rainy season ended. The last of the monsoons rose up dark gray with a froth of white cloud on top, looking exactly like a giant wave about to break.</p>

<p>Dry cooler air arrived.</p>

<p>After work was over Dara convinced her to go for a walk along the river in front of the Royal Palace. He went to the men&rsquo;s room to change into a new luxury suit and Sith thought: he&rsquo;s beginning to imagine life with all that money.</p>

<p>As they walked along the river, exposed to all those people, Sith shook inside. There were teenage boys everywhere. Some of them were in rags, which was reassuring, but some of them were very well dressed indeed, the sons of Impunity who could do anything. Sith swerved suddenly to avoid even seeing them. But Dara in his new beige suit looked like one of them, and the generals&rsquo; sons nodded to him with quizzical eyebrows, perhaps wondering who he was.</p>

<p>In front of the palace, a pavilion reached out over the water. Next to it a traditional orchestra bashed and wailed out something old fashioned. Hundreds of people crowded around a tiny wat. Dara shook Sith&rsquo;s wrist and they stood up to see.</p>

<p>People held up bundles of lotus flowers and incense in prayer. They threw the bundles into the wat. Monks immediately shoveled the joss sticks and flowers out of the back.</p>

<p>Behind the wat, children wearing T-shirts and shorts black with filth rootled through the dead flowers, the smoldering incense, and old coconut shells.</p>

<p>Sith asked, <q>Why do they do that?</q></p>

<p><q>You are so innocent!</q> chuckled Dara and shook his head. The evening was blue and gold. Sith had time to think that she did not want to go back to a hotel and that the only place she really felt happy was next to Dara. All around that thought was something dark and tangled.</p>

<p>Dara suggested with affection that they should get married.</p>

<p>It was as if Sith had her answer ready. <q>No, absolutely not,</q> she said at once. <q>How can you ask that? There is not even anyone for you to ask! Have you spoken to your family about me? Has your family made any checks about my background?</q></p>

<p>Which was what she really wanted to know.</p>

<p>Dara shook his head. <q>I have explained that you are an orphan, but they are not concerned with that. We are modest people. They will be happy if I am happy.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course they won&rsquo;t be! Of course they will need to do checks.</q></p>

<p>Sith scowled. She saw her way to sudden advantage. <q>At least they must consult fortunetellers. They are not fools. I can help them. Ask them the names of the fortunetellers they trust.</q></p>

<p>Dara smiled shyly. <q>We have no money.</q></p>

<p><q>I will give them money and you can tell them that you pay.</q></p>

<p>Dara&rsquo;s eyes searched her face. <q>I don&rsquo;t want that.</q></p>

<p><q>How will we know if it is a good marriage? And your poor mother, how can you ask her to make a decision like this without information? So. You ask your family for the names of good professionals they trust, and I will pay them, and I will go to Prime Minister Hun Sen&rsquo;s own personal fortuneteller, and we can compare results.</q></p>

<p>Thus she established again both her propriety and her status.</p>

<p>In an old romance, the parents would not approve of the match and the fortuneteller would say that the marriage was ill-omened. Sith left nothing to romance.</p>

<p>She offered the family&rsquo;s fortunetellers whatever they wanted &mdash; a car, a farm &mdash; and in return demanded a written copy of their judgment. All of them agreed that the portents for the marriage were especially auspicious.</p>

<p>Then she secured an appointment with the Prime Minister&rsquo;s fortuneteller.</p>

<p>Hun Sen&rsquo;s <i>Kru Taey</i> was a lady in a black business suit. She had long fingernails like talons, but they were perfectly manicured and frosted white.</p>

<p>She was the kind of fortuneteller who is possessed by someone else&rsquo;s spirit. She sat at a desk and looked at Sith as unblinking as a fish, both her hands steepled together. After the most basic of hellos, she said. <q>Dollars only. Twenty-five thousand. I need to buy my son an apartment.</q></p>

<p><q>That&rsquo;s a very high fee,</q> said Sith.</p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s not a fee. It is a consideration for giving you the answer you want. My fee is another twenty-five thousand dollars.</q></p>

<p>They negotiated. Sith liked the Kru Taey&rsquo;s manner. It confirmed everything Sith believed about life.</p>

<p>The fee was reduced somewhat but not the consideration.</p>

<p><q>Payment up-front now,</q> the Kru Taey said. She wouldn&rsquo;t take a check. Like only the very best restaurants she accepted foreign credit cards. Sith&rsquo;s Swiss card worked immediately. It had unlimited credit in case she had to leave the country in a hurry.</p>

<p>The Kru Taey said, <q>I will tell the boy&rsquo;s family that the marriage will be particularly fortunate.</q></p>

<p>Sith realized that she had not yet said anything about a boy, his family, or a marriage.</p>

<p>The Kru Taey smiled. <q>I know you are not interested in your real fortune. But to be kind, I will tell you unpaid that this marriage really is particularly well favored. All the other fortunetellers would have said the same thing without being bribed.</q></p>

<p>The Kru Taey&rsquo;s eyes glinted in the most unpleasant way. <q>So you needn&rsquo;t have bought them farms or paid me an extra twenty-five thousand dollars.</q> She looked down at her perfect fingernails. <q>You will be very happy indeed. But not before your entire life is overturned.</q></p>

<p>The back of Sith&rsquo;s arms prickled as if from cold. She should have been angry but she could feel herself smiling. Why?</p>

<p>And why waste politeness on the old witch? Sith turned to go without saying good-bye.</p>

<p><q>Oh, and about your other problem,</q> said the woman.</p>

<p>Sith turned back and waited.</p>

<p><q>Enemies,</q> said the Kru Taey, <q>can turn out to be friends.</q></p>

<p>Sith sighed. <q>What are you talking about?</q></p>

<p>The Kru Taey&rsquo;s smile was a wide as a tiger-trap. <q>The million people your father killed.</q></p>

<p>Sith went hard. <q>Not a million,</q> she said. <q>Somewhere between two hundred and fifty and five hundred thousand.</q></p>

<p><q>Enough,</q> smiled the Kru Taey. <q>My father was one of them.</q> She smiled for a moment longer. <q>I will be sure to tell the Prime Minister that you visited me.</q></p>

<p>Sith snorted as if in scorn. <q>I will tell him myself.</q></p>

<p>But she ran back to her car.</p>

<p>That night, Sith looked down on all the lights like diamonds. She settled onto the giant mattress and turned on her iPod.</p>

<p>Someone started to yell at her. She pulled out the earpieces and jumped to the window. It wouldn&rsquo;t open. She shook it and wrenched its frame until it reluctantly slid an inch and she threw the iPod out of the twenty-first-floor window.</p>

<p>She woke up late the next morning, to hear the sound of the TV. She opened up the double doors into the salon and saw Jorani, pressed against the wall.</p>

<p><q>The TV&hellip;,</q> Jorani said, her eyes wide with terror.</p>

<p>The driver waited by his packed bags. He stood up, looking as mournful as a bloodhound.</p>

<p>On the widescreen TV there was what looked like a pop music karaoke video. Except that the music was very old fashioned. Why would a pop video show a starving man eating raw maize in a field? He glanced over his shoulder in terror as he ate. The glowing singalong words were the song that the dog had sung at the top of the stairs. The starving man looked up at Sith and corn mash rolled out of his mouth.</p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s all like that,</q> said the driver. <q>I unplugged the set, but it kept playing on every channel.</q> He sompiahed but looked miserable. <q>My wife wants to leave.</q></p>

<p>Sith felt shame. It was miserable and dirty, being infested with ghosts. Of course they would want to go.</p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s okay. I can take taxis,</q> she said.</p>

<p>The driver nodded, and went into the next room and whispered to his wife. With little scurrying sounds, they gathered up their things. They sompiahed, and apologized.</p>

<p>The door clicked almost silently behind them.</p>

<p>It will always be like this, thought Sith. Wherever I go. It would be like this with Dara.</p>

<p>The hotel telephone started to ring. Sith left it ringing. She covered the TV with a blanket, but the terrible, tinny old music kept wheedling and rattling its way out at her, and she sat on the edge of her bed, staring into space.</p>

<p><i>I&rsquo;ll have to leave Cambodia.</i></p>

<p>At the market, Dara looked even more cheerful than usual. The fortunetellers had pronounced the marriage as very favorable. His mother had invited Sith home for the Pchum Ben festival.</p>

<p><q>We can take the bus tomorrow,</q> he said.</p>

<p><q>Does it smell? All those people in one place?</q></p>

<p><q>It smells of air freshener. Then we take a taxi, and then you will have to walk up the track.</q> Dara suddenly doubled up in laughter. <q>Oh, it will be good for you.</q></p>

<p><q>Will there be dirt?</q></p>

<p><q>Everywhere! Oh, your dirty Nikes will earn you much merit!</q></p>

<p>But at least, thought Sith, there will be no TV or phones.</p>

<p>Two days later, Sith was walking down a dirt track, ducking tree branches. Dust billowed all over her shoes. Dara walked behind her, chuckling, which meant she thought he was scared too.</p>

<p>She heard a strange rattling sound. <q>What&rsquo;s that noise?</q></p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s a goat,</q> he said. <q>My mother bought it for me in April as a present.</q></p>

<p>A goat. How could they be any more rural? Sith had never seen a goat. She never even imagined that she would.</p>

<p>Dara explained. <q>I sell them to the Muslims. It is Agricultural Diversification.</q></p>

<p>There were trees everywhere, shadows crawling across the ground like snakes. Sith felt sick. <i>One mosquito</i>, she promised herself, <i>just one and I will squeal and run away.</i></p>

<p>The house was tiny, on thin twisting stilts. She had pictured a big fine country house standing high over the ground on concrete pillars with a sunburst carving in the gable. The kitchen was a hut that sat directly on the ground, no stilts, and it was made of palm-leaf panels and there was no electricity. The strip light in the ceiling was attached to a car battery and they kept a live fire on top of the concrete table to cook. Everything smelled of burnt fish.</p>

<p>Sith loved it.</p>

<p>Inside the hut, the smoke from the fires kept the mosquitoes away. Dara&rsquo;s mother, Mrs. Non Kunthea, greeted her with a smile. That triggered a respectful sompiah from Sith, the prayer-like gesture leaping out of her unbidden. On the platform table was a plastic sack full of dried prawns.</p>

<p>Without thinking, Sith sat on the table and began to pull the salty prawns out of their shells.</p>

<p><i>Why am I doing this?</i></p>

<p><i>Because it&rsquo;s what I did at home.</i></p>

<p>Sith suddenly remembered the enclosure in the forest, a circular fenced area. Daddy had slept in one house, and the women in another. Sith would talk to the cooks. For something to do, she would chop vegetables or shell prawns. Then Daddy would come to eat and he&rsquo;d sit on the platform table and she, little Sith, would sit between his knees.</p>

<p>Dara&rsquo;s older brother Yuth came back for lunch. He was pot-bellied and drove a taxi for a living, and he moved in hard jabs like an angry old man. He reached too far for the rice and Sith could smell his armpits.</p>

<p><q>You see how we live,</q> Yuth said to Sith. <q>This is what we get for having the wrong patron. Sihanouk thought we were anti-monarchist. To Hun Sen, we were the enemy. Remember the Work for Money program?</q></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><q>They didn&rsquo;t give any of those jobs to us. We might as well have been the Khmer Rouge!</q></p>

<p><i>The past,</i> thought Sith, <i>why don&rsquo;t they just let it go? Why do they keep boasting about their old wars?</i></p>

<p>Mrs. Non Kunthea chuckled with affection. <q>My eldest son was born angry,</q> she said. <q>His slogan is &lsquo;ten years is not too late for revenge.&rsquo;</q></p>

<p>Yuth started up again. <q>They treat that old monster Pol Pot better than they treat us. But then, he was an important person. If you go to his stupa in Anlong Veng, you will see that people leave offerings! They ask him for lottery numbers!</q></p>

<p>He crumpled his green, soft, old-fashioned hat back onto his head and said, <q>Nice to meet you, Sith. Dara, she&rsquo;s too high class for the likes of you.</q> But he grinned as he said it. He left, swirling disruption in his wake.</p>

<p>The dishes were gathered. Again without thinking, Sith swept up the plastic tub and carried it to the blackened branches. They rested over puddles where the washing-up water drained.</p>

<p><q>You shouldn&rsquo;t work,</q> said Dara&rsquo;s mother. <q>You are a guest.</q></p>

<p><q>I grew up in a refugee camp,</q> said Sith. After all, it was true.</p>

<p>Dara looked at her with a mix of love, pride, and gratitude for the good fortune of a rich wife who works.</p>

<p>And that was the best Sith could hope for. This family would be fine for her.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon, all four brothers came with their wives for the end of Pchum Ben, when the ghosts of the dead can wander the Earth. People scatter rice on the temple floors to feed their families. Some ghosts have small mouths so special rice is used.</p>

<p>Sith never took part in Pchum Ben. How could she go the temple and scatter rice for Pol Pot?</p>

<p>The family settled in the kitchen chatting and joking, and it all passed in a blur for Sith. Everyone else had family they could honor. To Sith&rsquo;s surprise one of the uncles suggested that people should write names of the deceased and burn them, to transfer merit. It was nothing to do with Pchum Ben, but a lovely idea, so all the family wrote down names.</p>

<p>Sith sat with her hands jammed under her arms.</p>

<p>Dara&rsquo;s mother asked, <q>Isn&rsquo;t there a name you want to write, Sith?</q></p>

<p><q>No,</q> said Sith in a tiny voice. How could she write the name Pol Pot? He was surely roaming the world let loose from hell. <q>There is no one.</q></p>

<p>Dara rubbed her hand. <q>Yes there is, Sith. A very special name.</q></p>

<p><q>No, there&rsquo;s not.</q></p>

<p>Dara thought she didn&rsquo;t want them to know her father was Kol Vireakboth. He leant forward and whispered. <q>I promise. No one will see it.</q></p>

<p>Sith&rsquo;s breath shook. She took the paper and started to cry.</p>

<p><q>Oh,</q> said Dara&rsquo;s mother, stricken with sympathy. <q>Everyone in this country has a tragedy.</q></p>

<p>Sith wrote the name Kol Vireakboth.</p>

<p>Dara kept the paper folded and caught Sith&rsquo;s eyes. <i>You see?</i> he seemed to say. <i>I have kept your secret safe</i>. The paper burned.</p>

<p>Thunder slapped a clear sky about the face. It had been sunny, but now as suddenly as a curtain dropped down over a doorway, rain fell. A wind came from nowhere, tearing away a flap of palm-leaf wall, as if forcing entrance in a fury.</p>

<p>The family whooped and laughed and let the rain drench their shoulders as they stood up to push the wall back down, to keep out the rain.</p>

<p>But Sith knew. Her father&rsquo;s enemy was in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The rain passed; the sun came out. The family chuckled and sat back down around or on the table. They lowered dishes of food and ate, making parcels of rice and fish with their fingers. Sith sat rigidly erect, waiting for misfortune.</p>

<p>What would the spirit of Kol Vireakboth do to Pol Pot&rsquo;s daughter? Would he overturn the table, soiling her with food? Would he send mosquitoes to bite and make her sick? Would he suck away all her good fortune, leaving the marriage blighted, her new family estranged?</p>

<p>Or would a kindly spirit simply wish that the children of all Cambodians could escape, escape the past?</p>

<p>Suddenly, Sith felt at peace. The sunlight and shadows looked new to her and her senses started to work in magic ways.</p>

<p>She smelled a perfume of emotion, sweet and bracing at the same time. The music from a neighbor&rsquo;s cassette player touched her arm gently. Words took the form of sunlight on her skin.</p>

<p><i>No one is evil,</i> the sunlight said. <i>But they can be false. False, how</i>? Sith asked without speaking, genuinely baffled. The sunlight smiled with an old man&rsquo;s stained teeth. <i>You know very well how.</i></p>

<p>All the air swelled with the scent of the food, savoring it. The trees sighed with satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Life is true.</i> Sith saw steam from the rice curl up into the branches. <i>Death is false.</i></p>

<p>The sunlight stood up to go. It whispered. <i>Tell him.</i></p>

<p>The world faded back to its old self.</p>

<p>That night in a hammock in a room with the other women, Sith suddenly sat bolt upright. Clarity would not let her sleep. She saw that there was no way ahead. She couldn&rsquo;t marry Dara. How could she ask him to marry someone who was harassed by one million dead? How could she explain I am haunted because I am Pol Pot&rsquo;s daughter and I have lied about everything?</p>

<p>The dead would not let her marry; the dead would not let her have joy. So who could Pol Pot&rsquo;s daughter pray to? Where could she go for wisdom?</p>

<p><i>Loak kru Kol Vireakboth,</i> she said under her breath. <i>Please show me a way ahead.</i></p>

<p>The darkness was sterner than the sunlight.</p>

<p><i>To be as false as you are,</i> it said, <i>you first have to lie to yourself.</i></p>

<p>What lies had Sith told? She knew the facts. Her father had been the head of a government that tortured and killed hundreds of thousands of people and starved the nation through mismanagement. I know the truth.</p>

<p>I just never think about it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never faced it.</p>

<p><i>Well, the truth is as dark as I am, and you live in me, the darkness</i>.</p>

<p>She had read books &mdash; well, the first chapter of books &mdash; and then dropped them as if her fingers were scalded. There was no truth for her in books. The truth ahead of her would be loneliness, dreary adulthood, and penance.</p>

<p><i>Grow up.</i></p>

<p>The palm-leaf panels stirred like waiting ghosts.</p>

<p>All through the long bus ride back, she said nothing. Dara went silent too, and hung his head.</p>

<p>In the huge and empty hotel suite, darkness awaited her. She&rsquo;d had the phone and the TV removed; her footsteps sounded hollow. Jorani and the driver had been her only friends.</p>

<p>The next day she did not go to Soriya Market. She went instead to the torture museum of Tuol Sleng.</p>

<p>A cadre of young motoboys waited outside the hotel in baseball caps and bling. Instead, Sith hailed a sweet-faced older motoboy with a battered, rusty bike.</p>

<p>As they drove she asked him about his family. He lived alone and had no one except for his mother in Kompong Thom.</p>

<p>Outside the gates of Tuol Sleng he said, <q>This was my old school.</q></p>

<p>In one wing there were rows of rooms with one iron bed in each with handcuffs and stains on the floor. Photos on the wall showed twisted bodies chained to those same beds as they were found on the day of liberation. In one photograph, a chair was overturned as if in a hurry.</p>

<p>Sith stepped outside and looked instead at a beautiful house over the wall across the street. It was a high white house like her own, with pillars and a roof terrace and bougainvillaea, a modern daughter&rsquo;s house. What do they think when they look out from that roof terrace? How can they live here?</p>

<p>The grass was tended and full of hopping birds. People were painting the shutters of the prison a fresh blue-gray.</p>

<p>In the middle wing, the rooms were galleries of photographed faces. They stared out at her like the faces from her printer. Were some of them the same?</p>

<p><q>Who are they?</q> she found herself asking a Cambodian visitor.</p>

<p><q>Their own,</q> the woman replied. <q>This is where they sent Khmer Rouge cadres who had fallen out of favor. They would not waste such torture on ordinary Cambodians.</q></p>

<p>Some of the faces were young and beautiful men. Some were children or dignified old women.</p>

<p>The Cambodian lady kept pace with her. Company? Did she guess who Sith was? <q>They couldn&rsquo;t simply beat party cadres to death. They sent them and their entire families here. The children too, the grandmothers. They had different days of the week for killing children and wives.</q></p>

<p>An innocent looking man smiled out at the camera as sweetly as her aged motoboy, directly into the camera of his torturers. He seemed to expect kindness from them, and decency. <i>Comrades</i>, he seemed to say.</p>

<p>The face in the photograph moved. It smiled more broadly and was about to speak.</p>

<p>Sith eyes darted away. The next face sucked all her breath away.</p>

<p>It was not a stranger. It was Dara, her Dara, in black shirt and black cap. She gasped and looked back at the lady. Her pinched and solemn face nodded up and down. Was she a ghost too?</p>

<p>Sith reeled outside and hid her face and didn&rsquo;t know if she could go on standing. Tears slid down her face and she wanted to be sick and she turned her back so no one could see.</p>

<p>Then she walked to the motoboy, sitting in a shelter. In complete silence, she got on his bike feeling angry at the place, angry at the government for preserving it, angry at the foreigners who visited it like a tourist attraction, angry at everything.</p>

<p><i>That is not who we are! That is not what I am!</i></p>

<p>The motoboy slipped onto his bike, and Sith asked him: What happened to your family? It was a cruel question. He had to smile and look cheerful. His father had run a small shop; they went out into the country and never came back. He lived with his brother in a jeum-room, a refugee camp in Thailand. They came back to fight the Vietnamese and his brother was killed.</p>

<p>She was going to tell the motoboy, drive me back to the Hilton, but she felt ashamed. Of what? Just how far was she going to run?</p>

<p>She asked him to take her to the old house on Monivong Boulevard.</p>

<p>As the motorcycle wove through back streets, dodging red-earth ruts and pedestrians, she felt rage at her father. How dare he involve her in something like that! Sith had lived a small life and had no measure of things so she thought: <i>it&rsquo;s as if someone tinted my hair and it all fell out. It&rsquo;s as if someone pierced my ears and they got infected and my whole ear rotted away.</i></p>

<p>She remembered that she had never felt any compassion for her father. She had been twelve years old when he stood trial, old and sick and making such a show of leaning on his stick. Everything he did was a show. She remembered rolling her eyes in constant embarrassment. Oh, he was fine in front of rooms full of adoring students. He could play the <i>bong thom</i> with them. They thought he was enlightened. He sounded good, using his false, soft and kindly little voice, as if he was dubbed. He had made Sith recite Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Rilke. He killed thousands for having foreign influences.</p>

<p><i>I don&rsquo;t know what I did in a previous life to deserve you for a father. But you were not my father in a previous life and you won&rsquo;t be my father in the next. I reject you utterly. I will never burn your name. You can wander hungry out of hell every year for all eternity. I will pray to keep you in hell. </i></p>

<p><i>I am not your daughter!</i></p>

<p><i>If you were false, I have to be true.</i></p>

<p>Her old house looked abandoned in the stark afternoon light, closed and innocent. At the doorstep she turned and thrust a fistful of dollars into the motoboy&rsquo;s hand. She couldn&rsquo;t think straight; she couldn&rsquo;t even see straight, her vision blurred.</p>

<p>Back inside, she calmly put down her teddy-bear rucksack and walked upstairs to her office. Aido the robot dog whirred his way toward her. She had broken his back leg kicking him downstairs. He limped, whimpering like a dog, and lowered his head to have it stroked.</p>

<p>To her relief, there was only one picture waiting for her in the tray of the printer.</p>

<p>Kol Vireakboth looked out at her, middle-aged, handsome, worn, wise. Pity and kindness glowed in his eyes.</p>

<p>The land line began to ring.</p>

<p><q><i>Youl prom,</i></q> she told the ghosts. Agreed.</p>

<p>She picked up the receiver and waited.</p>

<p>A man spoke. <q>My name was Yin Bora.</q> His voice bubbled up brokenly as if from underwater.</p>

<p>A light blinked in the printer. A photograph slid out quickly. A young student stared out at her looking happy at a family feast. He had a Beatle haircut and a striped shirt.</p>

<p><q>That&rsquo;s me,</q> said the voice on the phone. <q>I played football.</q></p>

<p>Sith coughed. <q>What do you want me to do?</q></p>

<p><q>Write my name,</q> said the ghost.</p>

<p><q>Please hold the line,</q> said Sith, in a hypnotized voice. She fumbled for a pen, and then wrote on the photograph <i>Yin Bora, footballer</i>. He looked so sweet and happy. <q>You have no one to mourn you,</q> she realized.</p>

<p><q>None of us have anyone left alive to mourn us,</q> said the ghost.</p>

<p>Then there was a terrible sound down the telephone, as if a thousand voices moaned at once.</p>

<p>Sith involuntarily dropped the receiver into place. She listened to her heart thump and thought about what was needed. She fed the printer with the last of her paper. Immediately it began to roll out more photos, and the land line rang again.</p>

<p>She went outside and found the motoboy, waiting patiently for her. She asked him to go and buy two reams of copying paper. At the last moment she added pens and writing paper and matches. He bowed and smiled and bowed again, pleased to have found a patron.</p>

<p>She went back inside, and with just a tremor in her hand picked up the phone.</p>

<p>For the next half hour, she talked to the dead, and found photographs and wrote down names. A woman mourned her children. Sith found photos of them all, and united them, father, mother, three children, uncles, aunts, cousins and grandparents, taping their pictures to her wall. The idea of uniting families appealed. She began to stick the other photos onto her wall.</p>

<p>Someone called from outside and there on her doorstep was the motoboy, balancing paper and pens. <q>I bought you some soup.</q> The broth came in neatly tied bags and was full of rice and prawns. She thanked him and paid him well and he beamed at her and bowed again and again.</p>

<p>All afternoon, the pictures kept coming. Darkness fell, the phone rang, the names were written, until Sith&rsquo;s hand, which was unused to writing anything, ached.</p>

<p>The doorbell rang, and on the doorstep, the motoboy sompiahed. <q>Excuse me, Lady, it is very late. I am worried for you. Can I get you dinner?</q></p>

<p>Sith had to smile. He sounded motherly in his concern. They are so good at building a relationship with you, until you cannot do without them. In the old days she would have sent him away with a few rude words. Now she sent him away with an order.</p>

<p>And wrote.</p>

<p>And when he came back, the aged motoboy looked so happy. <q>I bought you fruit as well, Lady,</q> he said, and added, shyly. <q>You do not need to pay me for that.</q></p>

<p>Something seemed to bump under Sith, as if she was on a motorcycle, and she heard herself say, <q>Come inside. Have some food too.</q></p>

<p>The motoboy sompiahed in gratitude and as soon as he entered, the phone stopped ringing.</p>

<p>They sat on the floor. He arched his neck and looked around at the walls.</p>

<p><q>Are all these people your family?</q> he asked.</p>

<p>She whispered. <q>No. They&rsquo;re ghosts who no one mourns.</q></p>

<p><q>Why do they come to you?</q> His mouth fell open in wonder.</p>

<p><q>Because my father was Pol Pot,</q> said Sith, without thinking.</p>

<p>The motoboy sompiahed. <q>Ah.</q> He chewed and swallowed and arched his head back again. <q>That must be a terrible thing. Everybody hates you.</q></p>

<p>Sith had noticed that wherever she sat in the room, the eyes in the photographs were directly on her. <q>I haven&rsquo;t done anything,</q> said Sith.</p>

<p><q>You&rsquo;re doing something now,</q> said the motoboy. He nodded and stood up, sighing with satisfaction. Life was good with a full stomach and a patron. <q>If you need me, Lady, I will be outside.</q></p>

<p>Photo after photo, name after name.</p>

<p><i>Youk Achariya: touring dancer Proeung Chhay: school superintendent Sar Kothida child, aged 7, died of <q>swelling disease</q> Sar Makara, her mother, nurse Nath Mittapheap, civil servant, from family of farmers Chor Monirath: wife of award-winning engineer Yin Sokunthea: Khmer Rouge commune leader <i>She looked at the faces and realized.</i> Dara, I&rsquo;m doing this for Dara.</i> The City around her went quiet and she became aware that it was now very late indeed. Perhaps she should just make sure the motoboy had gone home.</p>

<p>He was still waiting outside.</p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s okay. You can go home. Where do you live?</q></p>

<p>He waved cheerfully north. <q>Oh, on Monivong, like you.</q> He grinned at the absurdity of the comparison.</p>

<p>A new idea took sudden form. Sith said, <q>Tomorrow, can you come early, with a big feast? Fish and rice and greens and pork: curries and stir-fries and kebabs.</q> She paid him handsomely, and finally asked him his name. His name meant Golden.</p>

<p><q>Good night, Sovann.</q></p>

<p>For the rest of the night she worked quickly like an answering service. This is like a cleaning of the house before a festival, she thought. The voices of the dead became ordinary, familiar. Why are people afraid of the dead? The dead can&rsquo;t hurt you. The dead want what you want: justice.</p>

<p>The wall of faces became a staircase and a garage and a kitchen of faces, all named. She had found Jorani&rsquo;s colored yarn, and linked family members into trees.</p>

<p>She wrote until the electric lights looked discolored, like a headache. She asked the ghosts, <q>Please can I sleep now?</q> The phones fell silent and Sith slumped with relief onto the polished marble floor.</p>

<p>She woke up dazed, still on the marble floor. Sunlight flooded the room. The faces in the photographs no longer looked swollen and bruised. Their faces were not accusing or mournful. They smiled down on her. She was among friends.</p>

<p>With a whine, the printer started to print; the phone started to ring. Her doorbell chimed, and there was Sovann, white cardboard boxes piled up on the back of his motorcycle. He wore the same shirt as yesterday, a cheap blue copy of a Lacoste. A seam had parted under the arm. He only has one shirt, Sith realized. She imagined him washing it in a basin every night.</p>

<p>Sith and Sovann moved the big tables to the front windows. Sith took out her expensive tablecloths for the first time, and the bronze platters. The feast was laid out as if at New Year. Sovann had bought more paper and pens. He knew what they were for. <q>I can help, Lady.</q></p>

<p>He was old enough to have lived in a country with schools, and he could write in a beautiful, old-fashioned hand. Together he and Sith spelled out the names of the dead and burned them.</p>

<p><q>I want to write the names of my family too,</q> he said. He burnt them weeping.</p>

<p>The delicious vapors rose. The air was full of the sound of breathing in. Loose papers stirred with the breeze. The ash filled the basins, but even after working all day, Sith and the motoboy had only honored half the names.</p>

<p><q>Good night, Sovann,</q> she told him.</p>

<p><q>You have transferred a lot of merit,</q> said Sovann, but only to be polite.</p>

<p><i>If I have any merit to transfer</i>, thought Sith.</p>

<p>He left and the printers started, and the phone. She worked all night, and only stopped because the second ream of paper ran out.</p>

<p>The last picture printed was of Kol Vireakboth.</p>

<p><i>Dara</i>, she promised herself. <i>Dara next</i>.</p>

<p>In the morning, she called him. <q>Can we meet at lunchtime for another walk by the river?</q></p>

<p>Sith waited on top of the marble wall and watched an old man fish in the Tonl&eacute; Sap river and found that she loved her country. She loved its tough, smiling, uncomplaining people, who had never offered her harm, after all the harm her family had done them. Do you know you have the daughter of the monster sitting here among you?</p>

<p>Suddenly all Sith wanted was to be one of them. The monks in the pavilion, the white-shirted functionaries scurrying somewhere, the lazy bones dangling their legs, the young men who dress like American rappers and sold something dubious, drugs, or sex.</p>

<p>She saw Dara sauntering toward her. He wore his new shirt, and smiled at her but he didn&rsquo;t look relaxed. It had been two days since they&rsquo;d met. He knew something was wrong, that she had something to tell him. He had bought them lunch in a little cardboard box. Maybe for the last time, thought Sith.</p>

<p>They exchanged greetings, almost like cousins. He sat next to her and smiled and Sith giggled in terror at what she was about to do.</p>

<p>Dara asked, <q>What&rsquo;s funny?</q></p>

<p>She couldn&rsquo;t stop giggling. <q>Nothing is funny. Nothing.</q> She sighed in order to stop and terror tickled her and she spurted out laughter again. <q>I lied to you. Kol Vireakboth is not my father. Another politician was my father. Someone you&rsquo;ve heard of.&hellip;</q></p>

<p>The whole thing was so terrifying and absurd that the laughter squeezed her like a fist and she couldn&rsquo;t talk. She laughed and wept at the same time. Dara stared.</p>

<p><q>My father was Saloth Sar. That was his real name.</q> She couldn&rsquo;t make herself say it. She could tell a motoboy, but not Dara? She forced herself onward. <q>My father was Pol Pot.</q></p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p>Sitting next to her, Dara went completely still. People strolled past; boats bobbed on their moorings.</p>

<p>After a time Dara said, <q>I know what you are doing.</q></p>

<p>That didn&rsquo;t make sense. <q>Doing? What do you mean?</q></p>

<p>Dara looked sour and angry. <q>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</q> He sat, looking away from her. Sith&rsquo;s laughter had finally shuddered to a halt. She sat peering at him, waiting. <q>I told you my family were modest,</q> he said quietly.</p>

<p><q>Your family are lovely!</q> Sith exclaimed.</p>

<p>His jaw thrust out. <q>They had questions about you too, you know.</q></p>

<p><q>I don&rsquo;t understand.</q></p>

<p>He rolled his eyes. He looked back &rsquo;round at her. <q>There are easier ways to break up with someone.</q></p>

<p>He jerked himself to his feet and strode away with swift determination, leaving her sitting on the wall.</p>

<p>Here on the riverfront, everyone was equal. The teenage boys lounged on the wall; poor mothers herded children; the foreigners walked briskly, trying to look as if they didn&rsquo;t carry moneybelts. Three fat teenage girls nearly swerved into a cripple in a pedal chair and collapsed against each other with raucous laughter.</p>

<p>Sith did not know what to do. She could not move. Despair humbled her, made her hang her head.</p>

<p><i>I&rsquo;ve lost him.</i></p>

<p>The sunlight seemed to settle next to her, washing up from its reflection on the wake of some passing boat.</p>

<p><i>No you haven&rsquo;t.</i></p>

<p>The river water smelled of kindly concern. The sounds of traffic throbbed with forbearance.</p>

<p><i>Not yet.</i></p>

<p>There is no forgiveness in Cambodia. But there are continual miracles of compassion and acceptance.</p>

<p>Sith appreciated for just a moment the miracles. The motoboy buying her soup. She decided to trust herself to the miracles.</p>

<p>Sith talked to the sunlight without making a sound. <i>Grandfather Vireakboth. Thank you. You have told me all I need to know.</i></p>

<p>Sith stood up and from nowhere, the motoboy was there. He drove her to the Hello Phone shop.</p>

<p>Dara would not look at her. He bustled back and forth behind the counter, though there was nothing for him to do. Sith talked to him like a customer. <q>I want to buy a mobile phone,</q> she said, but he would not answer. <q>There is someone I need to talk to.</q></p>

<p>Another customer came in. She was a beautiful daughter too, and he served her, making a great show of being polite. He complimented her on her appearance. <q>Really, you look cool.</q> The girl looked pleased. Dara&rsquo;s eyes darted in Sith&rsquo;s direction.</p>

<p>Sith waited in the chair. This was home for her now. Dara ignored her. She picked up her phone and dialed his number. He put it to his ear and said, <q>Go home.</q></p>

<p><q>You are my home,</q> she said.</p>

<p>His thumb jabbed the C button.</p>

<p>She waited. Shadows lengthened.</p>

<p><q>We&rsquo;re closing,</q> he said, standing by the door without looking at her.</p>

<p>Shamefaced, Sith ducked away from him, through the door.</p>

<p>Outside Soriya, the motoboy played dice with his fellows. He stood up. <q>They say I am very lucky to have Pol Pot&rsquo;s daughter as a client.</q></p>

<p>There was no discretion in Cambodia, either. Everyone will know now, Sith realized.</p>

<p>At home, the piles of printed paper still waited for her. Sith ate the old, cold food. It tasted flat, all its savor sucked away. The phones began to ring. She fell asleep with the receiver propped against her ear.</p>

<p>The next day, Sith went back to Soriya with a box of the printed papers.</p>

<p>She dropped the box onto the blue plastic counter of Hello Phones.</p>

<p><q>Because I am Pol Pot&rsquo;s daughter,</q> she told Dara, holding out a sheaf of pictures toward him. <q>All the unmourned victims of my father are printing their pictures on my printer. Here. Look. These are the pictures of people who lost so many loved ones there is no one to remember them.</q></p>

<p>She found her cheeks were shaking and that she could not hold the sheaf of paper. It tumbled from her hands, but she stood back, arms folded.</p>

<p>Dara, quiet and solemn, knelt and picked up the papers. He looked at some of the faces. Sith pushed a softly crumpled green card at him. Her family ID card.</p>

<p>He read it. Carefully, with the greatest respect, he put the photographs on the countertop along with the ID card.</p>

<p><q>Go home, Sith,</q> he said, but not unkindly.</p>

<p><q>I said,</q> she had begun to speak with vehemence but could not continue. <q>I told you. My home is where you are.</q></p>

<p><q>I believe you,</q> he said, looking at his feet.</p>

<p><q>Then.&hellip;</q> Sith had no words.</p>

<p><q>It can never be, Sith,</q> he said. He gathered up the sheaf of photocopying paper. <q>What will you do with these?</q></p>

<p>Something made her say, <q>What will <i>you</i> do with them?</q></p>

<p>His face was crossed with puzzlement.</p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s your country too. What will you do with them? Oh, I know, you&rsquo;re such a poor boy from a poor family, who could expect anything from you? Well, you have your whole family and many people have no one. And you can buy new shirts and some people only have one.</q></p>

<p>Dara held out both hands and laughed. <q>Sith?</q> <i>You, Sith are accusing </i>me <i>of being selfish</i>?</p>

<p><q>You own them too.</q> Sith pointed to the papers, to the faces. <q>You think the dead don&rsquo;t try to talk to you, too?</q></p>

<p>Their eyes latched. She told him what he could do. <q>I think you should make an exhibition. I think Hello Phones should sponsor it. You tell them that. You tell them Pol Pot&rsquo;s daughter wishes to make amends and has chosen them. Tell them the dead speak to me on their mobile phones.</q></p>

<p>She spun on her heel and walked out. She left the photographs with him.</p>

<p>That night she and the motoboy had another feast and burned the last of the unmourned names. There were many thousands.</p>

<p>The next day she went back to Hello Phones.</p>

<p><q>I lied about something else,</q> she told Dara. She took out all the reports from the fortunetellers. She told him what Hun Sen&rsquo;s fortuneteller had told her. <q>The marriage is particularly well favored.</q></p>

<p><q>Is that true?</q> He looked wistful.</p>

<p><q>You should not believe anything I say. Not until I have earned your trust. Go consult the fortunetellers for yourself. This time you pay.</q></p>

<p>His face went still and his eyes focused somewhere far beneath the floor. Then he looked up, directly into her eyes. <q>I will do that.</q></p>

<p>For the first time in her life Sith wanted to laugh for something other than fear. She wanted to laugh for joy.</p>

<p><q>Can we go to lunch at Lucky7?</q> she asked.</p>

<p><q>Sure,</q> he said.</p>

<p>All the telephones in the shop, all of them, hundreds all at once began to sing.</p>

<p>A waterfall of trills and warbles and buzzes, snatches of old songs or latest chart hits. Dara stood dumbfounded. Finally he picked one up and held it to his ear.</p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s for you,</q> he said and held out the phone for her.</p>

<p>There was no name or number on the screen.</p>

<p><i>Congratulations, dear daughter</i>, said a warm kind voice.</p>

<p><q>Who is this?</q> Sith asked. The options were severely limited.</p>

<p><i>Your new father,</i> said Kol Vireakboth. The sound of wind. <i>I adopt you.</i></p>

<p>A thousand thousand voices said at once, <i>We adopt you.</i></p>

<br/>

<p><span class="small-caps">In Cambodia,</span> you share your house with ghosts in the way you share it with dust. You hear the dead shuffling alongside your own footsteps. You can sweep, but the sound does not go away.</p>

<p>On the Tra Bek end of Monivong there is a house whose owner has given it over to ghosts. You can try to close the front door. But the next day you will find it hanging open. Indeed you can try, as the neighbors did, to nail the door shut. It opens again.</p>

<p>By day, there is always a queue of five or six people wanting to go in, or hanging back, out of fear. Outside are offerings of lotus or coconuts with embedded josh sticks.</p>

<p>The walls and floors and ceilings are covered with photographs. The salon, the kitchen, the stairs, the office, the empty bedrooms, are covered with photographs of Chinese-Khmers at weddings, Khmer civil servants on picnics, Chams outside their mosques, Vietnamese holding up prize catches of fish; little boys going to school in shorts; cyclopousse drivers in front of their odd, old-fashioned pedaled vehicles; wives in stalls stirring soup. All of them are happy and joyful, and the background is Phnom Penh when it was the most beautiful city in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>All the photographs have names written on them in old-fashioned handwriting.</p>

<p>On the table is a printout of thousands of names on slips of paper. Next to the table are matches and basins of ash and water. The implication is plain. Burn the names and transfer merit to the unmourned dead.</p>

<p>Next to that is a small printed sign that says in English HELLO.</p>

<p>Every Pchum Ben, those names are delivered to temples throughout the city. Gold foil is pressed onto each slip of paper, and attached to it is a parcel of sticky rice. At 8 A.M. food is delivered for the monks, steaming rice and fish, along with bolts of new cloth. At 10 A.M. more food is delivered, for the disabled and the poor.</p>

<p>And most mornings a beautiful daughter of Cambodia is seen walking beside the confluence of the Tonl&eacute; Sap and Mekong rivers. Like Cambodia, she plainly loves all things modern. She dresses in the latest fashion. Cambodian R&amp;B whispers in her ear. She pauses in front of each new waterfront construction whether built by improvised scaffolding or erected with cranes. She buys noodles from the grumpy vendors with their tiny stoves. She carries a book or sits on the low marble wall to write letters and look at the boats, the monsoon clouds, and the dop-dops. She talks to the reflected sunlight on the river and calls it Father.</p>
