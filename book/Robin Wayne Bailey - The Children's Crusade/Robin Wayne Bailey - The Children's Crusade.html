<h1>The Children’s Crusade</h1>
<h2>by Robin Wayne Bailey</h2>

<hr/>

<p class="first">Aryamand knelt at prayer in his small room and, with eyes closed and head bowed, tried to contemplate the nature of God. The words he whispered, though, were mere recitations, rote verses without enthusiasm, and his knees hurt. He wanted to be devout, but his mind churned with too many questions and too many doubts about the things they made him do.</p>

<p>His stomach rumbled with hunger, and he hesitated in his prayers until the sensation passed. Then, listening for any sound in the hallway outside his door, he bit his lip. He could go to the market, pick up a bit of fruit and be back before anyone knew he was gone. Everyone else was at prayer; nobody would miss him. But he pressed his head to the floor again. Hunger was no great burden.</p>

<p>A stern voice grumbled from his doorway, startling him. <q>Get up, Ari. I need you to do something for me.</q></p>

<p>Aryamand squeezed his eyes shut briefly, then rose and turned to face his uncle. No smile or hint of warmth brightened the weathered, dark-bearded face that stared from the shadowed arch, and his uncle’s dirty fatigues made him almost invisible in the poor lighting. Ari’s gaze went to the pistol belt his uncle wore and to the brown paper wrapped box he held.</p>

<p><q>Not at prayer, Uncle Abad?</q> Ari bit his lip, regretting the note of sarcasm.</p>

<p>Abad’s eyes narrowed to dangerous slits as he looked down on his nephew. <q>Take this to the Khafafin Mosque. Wait for your opportunity and place it behind the minbar. Then come right back. Someone will be watching.</q></p>

<p>Ari’s heart sank. <q>A mosque?</q> he protested. <q>Are we making war on our own people now?</q></p>

<p>Abad clenched his teeth, but he knelt down and took Ari by the shoulders. <q>We do what we must,</q> he answered. <q>Our people will blame the Americans and take to the street demanding revenge. You have to do this. We are the Hands of God.</q></p>

<p>Ari looked down at his scuffed shoes. Was it blasphemy, he wondered, to think that God’s hands had a lot of blood on them? He had no love for Americans; their bombs had killed his mother and his two young sisters. Remembering, he took the package from his uncle.</p>

<p><q>The timer is short &hellip;</q></p>

<p>Ari didn’t wait to hear any more. No warning and no sermon would make him feel better or ease his conscience. He obeyed his uncle because Abad had taken him in and given him a home, and he would do this job as he had done all the others Abad had given him. He glanced at his prayer rug, thinking that he should roll it up, but there was no time.</p>

<p>In the space of a heartbeat, he shifted. His small room faded in a brief flash of blackness, and when the blackness dissolved he stood in a shadowy alley across the street from the Khafafin Mosque. The street was filled with activity, and four armed Shia guards stood outside the entrance to the mosque. The open vestibule beyond, however, appeared empty, and Ari shifted again.</p>

<p>The silence inside the mosque startled him. Even the street sounds seemed reluctant to enter through the ancient, arched doorway. Mindful of his package, he crouched low, hoping no one had seen him, but as far as he could tell he was alone. At prayer time, the mosque would be full.</p>

<p>Wetting his lips, Ari spotted the minbar at the far side of the inner chamber and shifted once again. Still crouching, he reappeared behind the cloth-covered altar. His pulse raced, and he breathed faster as he dared to look around the altar’s edge. A sound caught his ear; a door opened on the north side of the chamber. A bearded imam paced across the tiled floor with a Qu’ran in the crook of one arm and vanished into still another room. Ari heard voices.</p>

<p>Out of sight behind the minbar, he sat down and stared at the brown paper wrapped box. A deep sadness came over him as he thought of his mother and two little sisters. He missed them so much! <i>This is for you,</i> he told himself as he pushed the box beneath the minbar’s overhanging cloth. Yet he knew that wasn’t true. This was for his uncle Abad.</p>

<p>Ari heard the imam’s voice again as a door opened, and he shifted once more. Empty-handed, his package delivered, he leaned from a rooftop parapet above the alley where he had first appeared. If he was too close, he didn’t care. Staring toward the mosque, he began to count.</p>

<p>The bomb blast shook the air. Pressure cracks fractured the mosque’s façade. A great cloud of dust and plaster roiled into the street and up through a newly gaping hole in the roof. Struck by fragments of stone or blown off their feet with bloody ears and noses, passersby screamed.</p>

<p>Gunfire sounded, random staccato shooting that caused Ari to look further down the street toward another building—the Saladeen School. Shia militia protected it, too, but they abandoned their posts and ran to defend the mosque.</p>

<p>Then, unexpectedly, a second blast more powerful than the first followed. On his rooftop perch, Ari felt the shock wave like a fist against his face and chest. He staggered backward and fell with his hands pressed to his head. Eyes stinging, filled with outrage, he got painfully to his feet again.</p>

<p>A black cloud of dust and fire shot upward from what remained of the Saladeen School. Rubble fell like rain. For an instant after the blast, absolute silence hung over the neighborhood, and the few people still on their feet in the roadway gaped, too stunned to seek shelter or protection. Then came the wailing and screaming.</p>

<p>Ari pressed himself against the parapet and strained to see through the smoke. The school’s entire eastern wall was gone. As he watched, a huge section of its roof collapsed, and the building next to it groaned and sank inward in a shower of brick and mortar.</p>

<p>Ari’s attention returned to the school’s main entrance as a pair of burned and ragged young boys stumbled out. Another boy came behind them, too much in shock to cry. No more than seven or eight years old, he tripped on a piece of debris and didn’t get back up.</p>

<p>The mosque, Ari realized, had only been a diversion to lure the militiamen away while another bomber got into the school, which had been the real target! Not clerics and imams, but children! It made no sense! Squeezing his eyes shut, he pounded clenched fists on the stone parapet and cursed himself over and over again, not knowing which was greater, his anger or his shame.</p>

<p>Then he snapped his eyes open. More children with bloody hands and faces staggered from the devastated structure, and he knew there must still be more inside. Without a thought for himself, he shifted, leaving his rooftop to reappear at the school’s entrance. He didn’t care who saw or who witnessed. He swept up the fallen seven-year-old in one arm, and gathered the first two boys in the other, and then shifted again.</p>

<p>He’d only seen the hospital on the American base near Baghdad Airport from a distance, but he knew it well enough. Pain flashed through his body as he materialized with his charges on its doorstep. He’d never shifted so quickly and with so much weight before.</p>

<p>A tall, uniformed American opened the door and nearly fell on top of him. <q>What the hell &hellip; ?</q></p>

<p>Ari looked up and answered in his poor English. <q>Please! Take care of them! There’s more!</q></p>

<p>Denying the fire in his muscles and brain, he shifted back to the school. This time, he ran through the entrance, ignoring the cascades of crumbling stone, the choking dust and the angry shouts of confused Shia. A boy his own age lay unconscious under a broken beam. As gently as he could, Ari hugged the boy, but a splintering and cracking drew his attention upward as a piece of the roof fell. Wide-eyed with panic, Ari drew a sharp breath and shifted barely in time.</p>

<p>A crowd of soldiers and medics were waiting around the American hospital entrance. A few jumped away as Ari appeared in their midst with his passenger. Some reached for their weapons. <q>If you’re really here to help Iraqis,</q> Ari shouted angrily, <q>start with this one!</q></p>

<p>Without waiting for a reaction, he shifted back to the Saladeen School. His brain burned as if on fire, the cost of so many shifts. But as he looked down at the body of a boy half-buried in the rubble he knew his pain was nothing. In the shadows nearby, another child groped about, blinded, bleeding and whimpering.</p>

<p>Ari couldn’t help himself. He began to cry even as he reached out for the sightless boy. <q>I’m so sorry!</q> he muttered as he wrapped the boy in his arms. He glanced back at the dead child in the rubble, but all he saw were his two sisters. That was how he remembered them after the bombs had fallen on their home in the night. A great sob shook him, and he shifted to the hospital again.</p>

<p><q>Stop! Wait!</q></p>

<p>Ari looked up as he set the blind boy carefully on his feet. The man who spoke was the same one who had nearly fallen on him before. A single star shone on the man’s collar. Ari didn’t know what it meant, and he didn’t care. He wiped a sleeve over his moist eyes and swallowed as a ring of soldiers cocked their guns. <q>I don’t listen to your orders!</q> he answered, tight-lipped. <q>I won’t ever take orders from gunmen and thugs again!</q></p>


<p>And he shifted. He wasn’t sure to where, just somewhere warm and familiar. Safe was too much to ask. No place in the world was safe. He collapsed immediately, weak and aching as if he’d taken a beating, and when he hit the floor he wept until exhaustion overcame him.</p>

<p>It was night when he awoke, but he knew where he was. A faint smile with a hint of sadness turned up the corners of his lips. Even in the gloom he knew the shape of the room and its broken roof. He imagined he heard his mother’s soft footsteps, and some echo of his sisters’ voices still wafted among the shattered walls. The moon poured in through an unshuttered window, filling the small house with ghosts and shadows.</p>

<p>He’d come home. Or to what was left of home. Some unconscious thought had brought him here before he passed out. He sat up in the empty corner where his old bed once had been. Some scavenger had carried it off. It had been a good bed, and he hoped someone was getting use of it.</p>

<p>He felt strong again, his pain gone, but in its place he found an emptiness, a loss that felt even worse. He shuffled through the ruins that once had been his house, remembering, saying goodbye to things that were already gone.</p>

<p><q>You’re too predictable, Aryamand. I told you to come right back.</q></p>

<p>His uncle had found him. He turned toward the silhouette in the crooked doorway and noted the two restless shapes standing a few steps behind. <q>I’m not coming back,</q> he answered with calm resolve.</p>

<p>Abad put a hand on his pistol butt. <q>It had to be done,</q> he growled. <q>You’re not old enough to understand the way of God yet.</q></p>

<p>Ari resisted the urge to laugh as he kicked at a bit of rubble. Old enough? Did his uncle even remember what day it was? While Ari had slept on the broken floor of his bombed-out home, he had turned fourteen.</p>

<p><q>You let outsiders see you today,</q> his uncle chided. <q>That was foolish.</q></p>

<p>Barely listening, Ari turned his back on his Uncle Abad. In a flat voice he said, <q>I renounce God. Particularly your God, and especially any God that would justify what we did today.</q></p>

<p>One of the men behind Abad hissed. <q>His mouth is filthy!</q></p>

<p>Abad’s footsteps stirred the debris as he moved toward Ari. <q>He’s confused,</q> his uncle argued. <q>I’ll see to his punishment.</q></p>

<p>Ari closed his eyes and thought of someplace far away, a favorite place he’d only recently come to know. <q>You wrapped a present today, Uncle,</q> he said over his shoulder, <q>but you forgot to wish me a happy birthday.</q></p>

<p>Darkness flashed around him, neither cold nor warm. He felt no sense of falling or flying, no sense of movement at all. One moment, he stood in a stray beam of moonlight in the ruins of his home, and the next he stood under a full moon on a hillside overlooking quiet Bethlehem.</p>

<p>With a soft smile on his lips, he sat down in the grass and folded his arms around his knees to study the faint, beautiful lights below. It wasn’t his first time on this hillside. He’d been pushing his limits, testing his abilities, shifting farther and farther in secret. It was like lifting weights, he’d discovered, like building muscle. The more he tried, the more he achieved.</p>

<p>To the north lay Jerusalem, another city in conflict. Always there was fighting and war. It seemed to make the world go around. No matter how far he shifted, he wondered if he could ever escape it, if he could ever feel safe.</p>

<p><q>Ari! Is that you?</q></p>

<p>Ari grinned as he leaned back on one hand and twisted around. <q>Abraham!</q> he answered in a low, excited voice. His only friend in the world walked down the slope. Abraham was tall, rail-thin for thirteen years and possessed of the biggest ears Ari had ever seen. <q>What are you doing here?</q></p>

<p>Abraham disappeared in mid-step and reappeared at Ari’s side. With gawkish grace, he folded his legs and sat down, too. <q>I’ve been coming here every night.</q> Reaching into a hip pocket of his trousers, he drew out a page from a magazine and unfolded it. <q>Since you showed me this.</q> In the moonlight it was hard to see, but Ari knew it showed the hillside upon which they sat. <q>I’ve been practicing and hoping you’d turn up,</q> Abraham continued. He clapped Ari’s shoulder. <q>Your English is getting better!</q></p>

<p>Ari blushed at the compliment. <q>How many shifts did you take to get here?</q></p>

<p>Abraham inclined his curly head. <q>Just one.</q></p>

<p>Ari’s eyebrows shot up. <q>From Tel Aviv?</q></p>

<p>Abraham nodded. <q>Thirty-two minutes, three seconds north; thirty-four minutes, forty-six seconds east. It’s easy with your picture, and easier when you know the longitude and latitude.</q> He looked at Ari from the corners of his eyes. <q>How many jumps to get here from Baghdad?</q></p>

<p><q>Just one,</q> Ari admitted. He tried to cover up as Abraham elbowed him in the ribs.</p>

<p>For a long time they were silent. Both boys folded their hands behind their heads and stretched out on the grass. Ari watched the stars parade overhead, naming the ones he knew, wondering at the others. He hadn’t had much of an education.</p>

<p>Not like Abraham. The Jewish boy was bright, well-schooled and well-traveled. He knew lots of things that Ari didn’t, like the longitude trick, and he learned quickly. Ari let go a long, deep sigh as he remembered. Only four years had passed since he’d found Abraham with some other captives, members of an international peace group, in a terrorist camp in northern Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Abraham’s parents had been killed. Like Ari, he was an orphan, and without understanding quite why, Ari had shifted his new friend to freedom. He frowned as he remembered how Uncle Abad had beaten him for days.</p>

<p>But that one shift had tripped a switch in Abraham’s brain. He’d tried to describe it to Ari. He saw patterns, he said, where he hadn’t before. Interstices, he called them. Small spaces between things that he could slip through.</p>


<p>Abraham was educated. Ari had never tried to analyze what he did. He’d just always been able to do it. As a baby, he’d sometimes turned up inexplicably in his mother’s bed, or so he’d been told.</p>

<p>He couldn’t teach it to everyone, though. He’d shifted his uncle numerous times with no result to see if Abad could learn.</p>

<p><q>They’re going to start looking for us,</q> Ari said. <q>A lot of people saw me shift today.</q> He sat up and looked at Abraham’s feet. <q>Where are your shoes?</q></p>

<p>The Jewish boy made a face. <q>I can teleport farther than ever,</q> he said, <q>but I still have trouble with <i>things</i>. I’m lucky to get here with my clothes on!</q></p>

<p>Ari lay back again and studied the moon as it sank lower in the sky. Thoughts of the Saladeen School crept into his mind, along with thoughts of the mosque bombing. That wasn’t the first package he’d delivered, and guilt gnawed at him.</p>

<p>His entire life had been filled with bombs. Bombs in shoeboxes and bombs from jet planes. Roadside bombs and guided missiles. What was the difference when the only result was indiscriminate death?</p>

<p>Tears leaked from his eyes, but he wiped them away before Abraham could see. <q>It’s my birthday,</q> he blurted.</p>

<p>Abraham sat up. <q>Really? That’s great!</q> He squeezed Ari’s knee. <q>I bet you didn’t get a present yet. What can I get you?</q></p>

<p>Ari thought for a moment as silly answers danced through his head. But then he turned quite serious. <q>A better world, Abraham.</q> He sat up and looked his only friend in the eyes. <q>I want a better world.</q></p>

<p>Abraham didn’t blink. <q>Can you wait until morning when the stores open?</q></p>

<p>Morning found them in the suburbs of Tel Aviv. Abraham’s foster parents were well-off, if not rich, and their pantry was stocked. While Ari stuffed a backpack with edibles and changed into some of Abraham’s clean clothes, his friend struggled with a note of explanation to leave behind. When that was done, Abraham went to a bookshelf and pulled down a world atlas.</p>

<p><q>We’re taking this, too,</q> he said. <q>Now where do you want to go? Where do we hatch this grand plot?</q></p>

<p>Ari scratched his chin. He’d seen magazines that some American soldiers had traded or given away in his country and remembered the beautiful pictures they often contained. He nodded to himself as he recalled a favorite, a place of monuments and memorials and architecture more grand than anything he’d ever seen.</p>

<p><q>Washington,</q> he whispered, speaking the name as his uncle had pronounced it.</p>

<p>Abraham wasted no time as he flipped through the atlas. <q>Thirty-eight minutes, fifty seconds north; seventy-seven minutes west.</q> Closing the book, he looked up with a worried expression. <q>Ari, I’ve never teleported that far!</q></p>

<p>Ari bit his lip, and then put his hands on his friend’s shoulders. <q>We’ll take it slow in as many small shifts as you need,</q> he said. <q>I’ll carry you whenever you need me to, and you’ll learn along the way.</q> He winked. <q>Just don’t lose your shoes!</q></p>

<p>Sunset of the next day found them on the lawn of the White House. It looked exactly like a photograph Ari had seen in a soldier’s magazine, and he grinned, pleased with himself for making his longest shift ever. <q>London to Washington!</q> he murmured.</p>

<p><q>Probably not a good spot,</q> Abraham said as a pair of uniformed men ran toward them. He looked pale and near exhaustion.</p>

<p>Ari wrapped his friend in his arms and shifted. Instantly, they were outside the fence among a crowd of tourists on Pennsylvania Avenue. A group of nuns flung up their arms like startled penguins, and a jogger took a tumble on the pavement. Ari shifted again, moving farther down the street and stared in confusion. He was used to crowded, war-torn Baghdad with its narrow streets and alleys, not to such wide-open space!</p>

<p><q>Let me!</q> Abraham said. <q>I was here a long time ago with my parents.</q> Darkness flashed around them, and the scene changed. The street was wide, but busy with honking cars and noisy pedestrians. For a dangerous moment, Ari froze, too stunned to move, until Abraham dragged him out of the traffic to the safety of a sidewalk.</p>

<p><q>Georgetown,</q> Abraham explained. <q>I think.</q></p>

<p>Ari stared at the shops and glittering window displays, the bright lights and neon. He’d never seen anything like it. Abraham tugged at his elbow.</p>

<p>They found an alley and, taking shelter behind a dumpster, searched their backpack for something to eat. The sky was growing darker as night came on, but Ari couldn’t resist peeking into the street. He found the city lights almost dizzying. Yet finally, exhaustion overcame him. Crawling back behind the dumpster, he curled up around his friend. Abraham was already asleep.</p>

<br/>

<p class="first">For days they lived on the street in alleys and crannies. When their supplies ran out, they engaged in minor thievery, taking apples and candy bars, cartons of milk and loaves of bread from supermarkets and convenience stores and shifting away before they were caught.</p>

<p>Under Ari’s tutelage, Abraham began to shift faster and with increasingly heavier objects. They made up games to pass the time and impress each other. Sometimes, they played pranks. Once, as they wandered through Georgetown, Ari paused to admire a parked Mercedes SL 500.</p>

<p><q>You like it?</q> Abraham asked.</p>

<p>Breathless, Ari nodded. With a chuckle, Abraham leaned against the expensive vehicle. An instant later, car and boy vanished. A dumpster reappeared in the space where the Mercedes had been parked, and Abraham sat perched like a gnome on top of it.</p>

<p>Ari gasped. <q>What did you do with the car?</q></p>

<p><q>The Barnes and Noble Bookstore,</q> he answered, grinning as he jumped down and hurried Ari away. <q>I left it on the rooftop. Let the owner figure that out!</q></p>

<p>But there were serious moments, too. One night, as they slept beneath the loading dock of a business in Dupont Circle, an explosion shook them awake. Filled with the old terrors of his past and his homeland, Ari sprang to his feet. He knew the sound a bomb made. Running around the corner with Abraham quick on his heels, he stared as smoke and flames poured from the ruins of a bar. Car horns activated by the blast raised a cacophony. Shards of glass sparkled on the sidewalk, in the street. A young man, his clothing in tatters, staggered through the wreckage of the door and fell.</p>

<p>Ari cursed. For the first time in his life, he’d begun to feel safe. He’d begun to sleep without listening for the sounds of bombs and missiles and gunfire. Yet not even here could he find such a thing as safety!</p>

<p>Clenching his fists, he shifted to the front of the bar. The flames from inside scorched his skin, and he sucked smoke. Still, he dropped to his knees and put his arms around the fallen man in the doorway. A once-handsome face turned to look up, and Ari gazed into eyes filled with pain and tears and confusion. Ari knew the look too well.</p>

<p><q>It’s all right,</q> Ari said, coughing, <q>I’ll get you somewhere away!</q> He stared around, but shattered cars blocked his view.</p>

<p>Abraham appeared at his side. <q>The park across the street!</q> the Jewish boy suggested. <q>Take him there! I’m going inside!</q></p>

<p>Ari stood up to get a look at the park. Then he touched the injured man’s shoulder and shifted him to a bench near the sidewalk, startling onlookers who had gathered to watch the excitement. <q>Don’t move!</q> Ari urged. <q>We’ll get help!</q> He stabbed a finger at a young couple watching close by. <q>You!</q> he shouted. <q>Call your authorities!</q></p>

<p>Abraham appeared with another young man whose neck and shirtless back were bleeding from multiple lacerations. <q>Ari, they don’t speak Farsi,</q> he reminded his friend. Then he shouted in English at the growing crowd. <q>Don’t just stand there! Who’s got a cell phone? Someone call for help!</q></p>

<p><q>I’ve already called it in.</q> The voice came from a stranger who stepped out of the crowd. He held a cell phone, and. As he bent over one of the victims, his gaze met Ari’s. The Iraqi boy felt a jolt of surprise. Though the man now wore the plain suit of a western businessman, only a few weeks ago he had worn the uniform of an American soldier with a gold star on his collar!</p>

<p><q>Ari, come on!</q> Abraham called.</p>

<p>Ari barely heard. His attention was focused on the hint of a pistol beneath the stranger’s left armpit as his jacket gaped open. It couldn’t be coincidence that this soldier was here in Washington. Ari’s heart hammered, and he thought about shifting away to a far, far place. Instead, he calmed himself and met the soldier’s gaze again with a defiant look of acknowledgement. <q>I have work to do,</q> he said, and before the soldier could respond, Ari shifted.</p>

<p>The flames inside the bar were intense. <i>An incendiary device,</i> Ari realized as he shielded his eyes from the heat. He knew his bombs and their types. This one had been designed for maximum damage. He shot a look around, spotting a half-conscious man beneath an overturned table, and on the floor near that one, lay another. Dead or alive, Ari couldn’t tell, but he grasped the hands of both and shifted them to the park. Abraham appeared a split-second later with the bartender, whose arms were burned and broken.</p>

<p>Ari cast a glance around for the soldier as an ambulance arrived screeching at the curb. <q>Why here?</q> he said to Abraham. <q>Why now?</q></p>

<p>Smoke and grime smudged Abraham’s face. He wiped an arm over his eyes before answering. <q>Even America has its religious fanatics,</q> he shouted. Then he vanished again.</p>

<p>The flames crackled as a brisk wind swept down the street. Choking smoke sent onlookers scattering, but the soldier returned with a pair of dark-suited men. Used to command, he shouted at the ambulance drivers as they hurried with their equipment. <q>Where the hell is the fire truck?</q> he demanded. <q>This entire block could go up!</q></p>

<p>The paramedics rushed toward the park bench and the victims on the ground. <q>It’s stuck in traffic,</q> one of them answered gruffly. <q>Two blocks back. Now get out of the way!</q></p>

<p>Once again, the soldier turned toward Ari. There was something challenging in the tall man’s gaze, and Ari stiffened, sensing trouble. Abraham reappeared with yet another unconscious victim as Ari walked toward the soldier. <q>Who are you, American soldier?</q> he demanded.</p>

<p>Even out of uniform, the man could not conceal his military bearing. He looked down at Ari as if studying him. <q>General David Piper,</q> he answered. <q>Brigadier General.</q></p>

<p>Ari lifted his head higher. Far down the block, he could see the distant flashing of red lights. <q>Keep the street clear, General.</q> He couldn’t quite keep the sneer out of his voice.</p>

<p>The general reached out as if to grab him, but Ari shifted. Darkness flashed, and he reappeared in front of the stranded fire truck. The noise from the siren, combined with the ear splitting honking and shouting of angry drivers, momentarily disoriented him. <i>Surely,</i> he thought, <i>Americans are the loudest people on earth</i>!</p>

<p>One of the firemen leaned out of the truck and waved an arm. <q>You stupid kid! Get out of the way! Get out of the way!</q></p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, Ari put his hands on the fire truck’s bumper. With some instinct he couldn’t explain, he sensed the sheer mass of the truck, its equipment, and its passengers. It was a new and interesting sensation.</p>

<p>The fireman waved again. <q>Get out of the &hellip; !</q></p>

<p>Ari shifted. Not just himself, but the entire fire truck.</p>

<p><q>What the holy hell?</q> The waving fireman stared dumbfounded at the burning bar right beside the truck, and leaned so far out of the window that he nearly fell before another fireman caught him. The rest of the fire team jumped down from their stations with their hands at their sides, jaws gaping and eyes wide.</p>

<p>The general ran into the middle of the street. <q>Get some water on it!</q> he shouted, giving one of the firemen a purposeful shove. <q>There are still people in there! Move!</q></p>

<p>Shocked into action, the fire team got busy.</p>

<p>Ari uncurled his fingers from the chrome bumper and straightened up. He felt strained, as if he’d run a race, but there was none of the pain and burning that had wracked him when he’d moved heavy objects only a few weeks before. He turned to look at the flames and the coils of thick hoses and the jets of streaming water, then bit his lip and smiled, knowing he’d done something great.</p>

<p>The general stepped into his field of view. <q>I want you to come with me, son,</q> he said in perfect Farsi.</p>

<p>Common sense told Ari to shift away, but the general intrigued him. <q>I knew that somebody would come after me,</q> he answered in his own language. <q>But how did you find me so quickly?</q></p>

<p>The general’s lips drew into a tight line before he answered. <q>Surveillance cameras,</q> he explained. <q>After Baghdad Airport, we formed a task force to locate you. We drew a blank the first few days, but then you turned up in London. The Brits have cameras on every corner. It’s Orwell’s <i>Nineteen Eighty-four</i> everyday over there, and half a dozen of them got your image.</q> He blinked, and then knelt down to address Ari eye to eye. <q>Same thing here, really, although Americans aren’t aware of it. When you turned up on the White House lawn, the cameras kicked in. And every time you stole an apple from a supermarket or a convenience store? Same thing. Surveillance cameras. We’ve had entire teams sweeping the neighborhood for you, knowing it was just a matter of time until you turned up again.</q></p>

<p>Ari’s eyes narrowed with suspicion. He looked at the destruction across the street, and then back to the general. <q>You set this bomb to lure me.</q></p>

<p>General Piper shook his head. <q>We’re the good guys, son,</q> he said. <q>We don’t operate that way.</q></p>

<p>Ari sneered, remembering the nights when American planes had streaked over Baghdad raining bombs. <q>It’s a matter of perspective,</q> he answered.</p>

<p>The general sighed. <q>I’m not inclined to argue politics with a kid,</q> he replied. <q>But we need to know how you do this amazing thing that you do.</q> He ran a hand along the side of the fire truck, and when he looked back, Ari thought his face was not so friendly. <q>The applications are infinite.</q></p>

<p>Something small and sharp struck Ari in the side of his neck, something that burned like chemical fire. Ari clapped a hand to the wound, detecting a tiny needle, and whirled to see where it had come from. The general’s powerful arms locked around his waist.</p>

<p>Panic overcame Ari. Kicking and scratching, knowing that he’d been drugged, he fought to get free. The fire spreading through his veins turned to cold, freezing. <q>No!</q> he protested, half delirious. <q>No, Uncle Abad! You won’t use me again!</q></p>

<p>The two suited figures he’d seen earlier rushed out of the park’s shadows. One of them raised a tranquilizer pistol to fire again. Ari kicked out once more, driving his heel against the general’s knee.</p>

<p>At the same time, darkness flashed. Barely conscious, Ari shifted to freedom, leaving his captor behind.</p>

<p>He reappeared in the home of his Uncle Abad and sank to his knees. Two dirty figures in fatigues spun toward him, pistols whipping from holsters. At a desk in the corner of the room, his uncle bent over the workings of another bomb. Abad’s eyes widened, and he shouted Ari’s name.</p>

<p>Reflexively, Ari shifted again, to the Khafafin Mosque this time. The rubble had been cleared, but the hot sun streamed down through a giant hole in the mosque’s roof. The Call to Prayer rang in his ears, mixed with shouts of outrage and fear. Despite the damage, the mosque was full of worshippers, and hands reached to seize him.</p>

<p>He couldn’t think, couldn’t even lift his head, but his power reacted, shifting him away yet again to a house in Tel Aviv where Abraham’s foster mother screamed at the sudden sight of him; to the middle of a busy street in Georgetown where a taxi nearly ran over him. Barely in time, he shifted from beneath the onrushing tires.</p>

<p>In an alley, behind yet another dumpster, he finally found shelter. Though filthy, the place had a familiar smell. It was night, he realized, and cool. Unable to keep his eyes open, he clutched at a plastic bag full of garbage and dragged it closer to make his pillow, and then curled up like an injured kitten, shivering until the drug in his system carried him to sleep.</p>

<br/>

<p class="first">An insistent tapping on his shoulder brought Ari awake. His body felt heavy, and at first he couldn’t seem to open his eyes. He ached in every muscle and joint, and his head throbbed as it never had before. Yet, he knew that it wasn’t from the shifting, but the aftereffects of the sedative.</p>

<p>The tapping continued, and an urgent voice spoke his name. <q>Ari, wake up! Aryamand! It’s me, Abraham!</q></p>

<p>Ari fought through the thick fog that filled his brain. Slowly, he peeled his eyes open and focused on the Jewish boy’s face. <q>You’re safe,</q> he muttered as he clutched at Abraham’s arm. <q>I didn’t mean to leave you.</q></p>

<p><q>Safe may be too optimistic,</q> Abraham whispered. He pressed a bottle of water against Ari’s lips. <q>People are looking for us. They seem to be everywhere.</q></p>

<p>Ari sipped and pushed the water bottle away. <q>Looking for us?</q> he said with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p><q>Those men tried to grab you!</q> Abraham reminded. <q>I teleported back into the park just as they shot you, but you vanished. So they took a shot at me, too, but I teleported the hell out of there!</q></p>

<p>Ari sat up and leaned against the dumpster. He smelled of rotten lettuce and his clothes felt damp. As he rubbed his temples, he remembered some of the places he’d shifted to in his delirious escape. There might have been others; he couldn’t remember. He glanced at Abraham. <q>Where did you go?</q></p>

<p>Abraham pulled at the lobe of one oversized ear. <q>Darfur in the Sudan,</q> he said with a sheepish frown.</p>

<p><q>I’ve been holding out on you, Ari. I have another friend—my best friend until I met you. Her name’s Suleima, and I’ve known her for a long time, since my parents worked as peacekeepers in that region.</q> He looked askance, and then offered the water bottle to Ari again. <q>I’ve been teaching her for the past few months the way you taught me.</q></p>

<p>Ari took a long pull from the bottle and sat up straighter. The drug aftereffects were wearing off. <q>What can she do?</q> Ari asked. The idea of a third shifter excited him.</p>

<p><q>She can’t move heavy objects yet, but she’s getting better,</q> Abraham answered. <q>And her range is terrific. I had nowhere else to go after you disappeared in the park. So I went to her.</q></p>

<p>Ari chewed his lip as he nodded his head. <q>Do her parents know?</q></p>

<p><q>She’s an orphan like us,</q> Abraham answered. <q>Her parents were government workers, but they were killed by Janjaweed rebels. She lives with an aunt now.</q> He shrugged and looked thoughtful. <q>I don’t think her aunt knows, but she has to wonder how I showed up.</q></p>

<p><q>How old is your friend?</q> Ari asked. <q>Do you think she’d join us here?</q></p>

<p>Abraham let out a long, slow breath. <q>She’s fourteen, and she’s already here. While I’ve been checking the alleys and parks and places where we slept or hung out, she’s been in a downtown library using the computers to track news stories about us and maybe turn up a clue about where you went. She’s good with computers.</q> A grin spread across his face, and his eyes twinkled. <q>We’re a bit of a news item. Maybe even celebrities. When you teleported that fire truck, some tourist with a video camera caught it. The pictures have been all over the television and newspapers. They even got film of the guys who shot you. That’s caused a real row. The government’s calling us a threat, but a lot of people think we’re heroes.</q></p>

<p>Ari closed his eyes and rubbed the side of his neck as a slow anger began to build. <q>We saved a lot of lives,</q> he grumbled, <q>and they still shot me!</q> He opened his eyes again and, with a shock, discovered that he was alone.</p>

<p>Not for long, though. Abraham reappeared a moment later with a girl hand-in-hand at his side. She was tall as a reed and nearly as thin with an impossible tangle of curly hair that spilled past her shoulders in a bushy ponytail. Her eyes were wide and dark, and gold earrings pierced both her ears. Her skin was black as coffee. It seemed to shine with captured light. She wore American blue jeans and Nikes with a white, embroidered blouse.</p>

<p>Her fresh-scrubbed look reminded Ari of how dirty and ragged he felt.</p>

<p>Abraham made introductions. Suleima extended her hand. <q>Abe tells me that you want to make a better world,</q> she said in accented English. Her expression was deeply serious. <q>I want to help.</q></p>

<p>Ari stared at Suleima’s hand. Her fingers were beautiful, delicate, like the rest of her. He took her hand as if it were a flower and then smiled at Abraham. He felt lucky to have two friends now.</p>

<p>They were all hungry. Abraham had repacked his backpack with supplies from the kitchen of Suleima’s aunt. Ari found some of the food strange, but he smacked his lips as he ate. When they were finished, he stood and walked to the end of the alley to look out. The afternoon sky was beginning to darken with storm clouds, and a brisk wind propelled a newspaper down the street. The air smelled of rain.</p>

<p>He felt a sudden concern for Suleima. He and Abraham were boys and tough, but it didn’t seem right that she should sleep in the street. <q>There are plenty of abandoned buildings and empty apartments around here,</q> he said as he scanned the skyline. <q>It’s time we put a roof over our heads.</q></p>

<p>Abraham leaned took a step outside the alley, too, and quickly backed up. <q>Forget the roof,</q> he said as he pulled the Iraqi boy back into the shadows. <q>It’s time we got out of here. That black van on the corner and the two men coming this way—I’m sure they’re looking for us. I’ve seen a lot of black vans today.</q></p>

<p><q>Two of them and three of us,</q> Suleima said as she shouldered the backpack. <q>Let’s give them a bath in the river.</q></p>

<p>Ari grinned. <q>It’s tempting,</q> he admitted. <q>But I’m the one who needs the bath, and I know where.</q> Taking Suleima and Abraham by the hands, he shifted all three of them to the Reflecting Pool before the Lincoln Memorial.</p>

<p>In the late hour and with a brewing storm, they found themselves alone except for a pair of homeless figures on a nearby park bench. The old men stared with blank, disinterested gazes, oblivious to the sudden appearance of the children. Ari noticed their clothes—old fatigues and army jackets. They were soldiers once, veterans of other wars.</p>

<p>He turned toward the memorial. He’d seen it the first time in the pages of a soldier’s magazine, and he’d never forgotten it. He only wished that he could read the words carved in the stone, but while he could speak some English, he could read none of it.</p>

<p>Abraham read for him. <q>Great words,</q> he said when he had finished. <q>A pity they’re so little honored.</q></p>

<p><q>I don’t know,</q> Ari said. He frowned and stepped back to stare at the great stone figure with its beard and stern expression. <q>They seem to glorify war, the righteousness and the heroicism of it. But even honored dead are still dead.</q></p>

<p>Suleima’s eyes flashed with hidden anger. She turned her back on the monument and walked the edge of the pool. <q>And their children are left parentless,</q> she added, <q>or worse.</q></p>

<p>Abraham and Suleima fell into a brooding silence, each wandering to opposite sides of the water, each lost in their own thoughts. Ari stripped off his shirt and trousers and washed them in the pool. His gaze constantly swept the park for signs of security police, and when his clothes were done, he pulled off his shoes and socks and bathed in the cool water. When he was clean, he donned his wet garments and hugged himself. The wind was turning chill.</p>

<p>He gazed toward the trees at the park’s edge as Abraham and Suleima joined him again. He suspected they contained security cameras, but he wasn’t ready to go. He looked toward the far end of the park where the illuminated Washington Monument loomed in the deepening dusk.</p>

<p><q>I want to fill this park with children,</q> he said in a low voice. <q>It’s time to send a message.</q></p>

<p>Abraham tilted his head. <q>A message to whom?</q></p>

<p>With his friends following, Ari began to walk along the pool’s edge. The Washington Monument drew closer, and beyond that, over the long expanse of the Mall, he could see the Capitol Building. On another quiet night with Abraham at his side, he had stood on its stone steps. But another structure beside the capitol interested him more—the Peace Monument.</p>

<p><q>You’ve got a peculiar look, Ari,</q> Abraham said when Ari didn’t answer. <q>What are you thinking?</q></p>

<p><q>I’m thinking of a new Peace Monument,</q> he said. Stopping, he lifted his nose and sniffed. The smell of rain was strong. The coming storm was only minutes away.</p>

<p><q>Do you really want to fill this park with children?</q> Suleima asked. <q>I know how to do that.</q> Ari and Abraham turned toward her at the same time. <q>With computers,</q> she continued. <q>Chat rooms and message boards to start. Then the word will spread. We’ll use the celebrity Abe says we have now.</q></p>

<p>Abraham gave a thoughtful nod. <q>One month from today,</q> he said half to himself. <q>We use the time to plan and work and grow stronger.</q> Then he spun toward Ari. <q>But why? I still don’t see &hellip;</q></p>

<p><q>I do,</q> Suleima interrupted. Her face was grim, yet excited as she reached out and took Ari’s hand.</p>

<p>A black van cruised along the western park perimeter and slowed down as it approached their position. Ari could feel the eyes trained upon him. <q>Let’s go,</q> he whispered as the first heavy drops of rain began to fall.</p>

<p>They found shelter on the north side of Franklin Park in a vacant hotel that was up for sale. Their rooms were musty and without utilities, but dry and secure. A neighborhood library just a block away allowed Suleima to work her magic for a few hours each day. She spread the word across the Internet, organized children into units, and promised those who could come to the mall a chance to change the world. With the rest of her time, she trained and grew stronger.</p>

<p>For their parts, Ari and Abraham followed fire trucks, police cars and emergency vehicles and made heroes of themselves in the eyes of the public, appearing long enough to save lives, then disappearing again. When an old man suffered a heart attack on the Capitol steps, a slight figure in a hooded sweatshirt shifted him to a hospital. When a train jumped track on the Baltimore-Washington corridor, a gawky young boy in a stocking cap teleported the injured to safety.</p>

<p>They didn’t restrict their activities just to Washington. In midwestern Kansas when a chemical spill threatened a small town, three children popped up to help with evacuations. In London, when terrorist bombs exploded in the subways, three small figures with camouflaged features arrived to shift the victims to emergency rooms and rescue stations.</p>

<p>In short time, they dominated the headlines and news programs, and speculation spread that they were more than just two or three.</p>

<p>Then in cities large and small, flyers began to appear announcing a call to children everywhere, not just in America, but around the world, to participate in a gathering on the Washington Mall. Governments and officials countered with dire warnings only to meet resistance from churches, service organizations and humanitarian groups.</p>

<p>Ari, Abraham and Suleima watched in amazement as a movement grew from their efforts. When a senator broke ranks with his party and came forward to fight for a park permit, Suleima flung her arms around Ari and cried.</p>

<p>On the night before the gathering, the three sat together in a dark hotel room nursing sodas and hamburgers that some grateful paramedics had given them. Abraham trembled, his voice nervous. <q>Are we ready for this?</q> he asked. <q>We’re just three kids, Aryamand.</q> Not <i>Ari,</i> but <i>Aryamand</i>. He dropped his gaze to the dusty floor.</p>

<p>Suleima shook her head. <q>We’re more than that, Abe,</q> she answered in a whisper. <q>We’re an army now. Somewhere among all those children we’re reaching out to will be others capable of doing what we can do.</q></p>

<p>Ari listened, but his thoughts were elsewhere, back in his homeland. While Abraham and Suleima talked, he remembered his mother and sisters, the long nights when American bombs fell from the dark skies. His ears rang with remembered gunfire, missiles, mortar rounds and bursting shells.</p>

<p>But worse, he remembered things he had done and packages he had carried. He remembered the hidden camps and hideouts his uncle had shown him, and all the murders he had done. He was more than a child. He was a terrorist.</p>

<p>And he had one more act of terrorism to commit before he could make atonement. Setting aside his sandwich, he arose and picked up a brown paper wrapped box from the dusty top of a dresser. <q>Stay inside tonight and rest,</q> he told his companions. <q>I have an errand, an offering to place in the Hand of God.</q></p>

<p>Before Abraham or Suleima could protest, he shifted. Distances meant nothing to him anymore. With effortless ease he crossed the world, and for the first time in a long while he wondered why he’d been given such a gift. When he shifted, he almost believed in God again, but a different God that no book or text or sermon could ever contain.</p>

<p>He arrived in Baghdad at dawn by his uncle’s bed. Abad lay sleeping with a thin gray coverlet drawn up to his waist. An AK-47 rifle leaned against the head of his bed, and a .45 automatic lay within reach on a table beside a copy of Islam’s Holy Book. Ari stood silently, watching his uncle in repose. Then, bending low, he pushed the paper-wrapped box beneath the bed’s edge.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the soft scrape of the paper on the floor, or maybe it was Ari’s quiet breathing that disturbed his uncle, but Abad’s eyelids peeled open. <q>So you’ve come home,</q> he said in a soft, deep voice as he rose up on one elbow. He looked his nephew up and down, and then his gaze drifted toward the automatic.</p>

<p>Ari shook his head. <q>This isn’t my home,</q> he answered, <q>and before you pick that up you should look beneath your bed.</q></p>

<p>Abad’s eyes narrowed, but he leaned over and felt with one hand until he found the box. Fear flashed across his face. Cautiously, he slid the box into view.</p>

<p><q>It’s just a box,</q> Ari said with cold emotion. <q>There’s nothing in it this time. But find another way to settle your differences, Uncle. If you ever explode another bomb, if you ever injure another child, look for me in the shadows and check under your bed.</q> He picked up the Qu’ran and dropped it on the coverlet. <q>Find another way.</q></p>

<p>Droplets of sweat beaded on Abad’s temples as he placed a hand on his Holy Book. He trembled, though he tried to hide it, and he spoke with false bluster. <q>So you think you’ve become a man, Aryamand?</q></p>

<p>Again, Ari shook his head, and he wondered if his uncle could ever change. <q>I’m just a boy,</q> he answered as he picked up the automatic and set it back on the table again. <q>A boy who hopes to respect his uncle again someday.</q></p>

<p>With that, he shifted away, back to America and to a dirty hotel room where night had closed in. Abraham and Suleima were asleep, curled up around each other on one of the creaky old beds. Flyers and leaflets announcing the gathering on the mall lay scattered on the floor with food cartons and empty soda bottles and napkins. Like a protective big brother, Ari sat down in a chair to watch over his two friends and to count the hours until morning.</p>

<p>At dawn, he woke them, and they stretched, rubbing their eyes with fists and yawning. They dressed in clean clothes, not new ones, but donations from a supportive Salvation Army worker, and they combed their hair and washed their faces with bottle water.</p>

<p>For a few moments, they stood together, their hands joined, each thinking private thoughts. Ari felt small and inadequate, and his friends looked so confident. He drew a deep breath. <q>Let’s go,</q> he said at last.</p>

<p>Still holding hands, they shifted to the mall, and appeared in the morning shadow of the Washington Monument. Suleima gasped. Her fingers tightened around Ari’s hand as she looked out upon the crowd already gathered—children alone and with their parents, teenagers and adults, reporters and news crews. Someone had prepared an elaborate stage.</p>

<p><q>These are your lists,</q> she said as she reached into the hip pocket of her jeans and drew out several pages of printed coordinates. <q>Be quick as you can.</q></p>

<p>Ari took his list and glanced at the first coordinate. He’d studied pictures of each destination and knew the numbers. Nodding to Suleima, he shifted.</p>

<p>On a street corner in Belfast, he found twelve children waiting with a priest and a minister. They cheered and waved familiar flyers as he appeared among them. <q>Join hands,</q> he called, and when all had joined hands, he shifted them across the Atlantic to the mall.</p>

<p>In front of a school in Manila, he found 40 children waiting with five teachers. He shifted, leaving them beside the Belfast group. In Kyoto, on the Bridge of Dreams, 130 students greeted him. Over a thousand youngsters with their parents waited in Trafalgar Square. Ari shifted them in two groups, and his heart soared.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, Abraham raced with a similar purpose. From Tel Aviv, he teleported seventy-five children with their rabbis, and from Jerusalem, another hundred. In Oman, Jordan, a throng of 200 waited with eager faces. From Nairobi, three hundred and twenty-six students came, and from Buenos Aires another three hundred.</p>

<p>Suleima worked her own list, collecting groups from Los Angeles, Seattle, Albuquerque, and Mexico City, from Wichita, Kansas City, Atlanta and Bangor, Maine. Her course took her across the continent and into Canada, to Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto.</p>

<p>The crowd on the mall swelled, and as news crews spread the word, still more people came from around the city and the suburbs.</p>

<p>On the perimeters, black vans drove slowly, and dark-suited figures prowled among the gathering.</p>

<p>When the long lists were completed, Ari and Abraham and Suleima reconnoitered in the shadow of the Washington Monument once again. Suleima looked pale and tired, but her large eyes burned with determination. Abraham was flushed with excitement. The Jewish boy who once couldn’t keep his shoes on beamed with pride as he looked out at the crowd. His gaze fastened on the stage and the banks of microphones. <q>This is what you wanted for your birthday,</q> Abraham said. <q>It’s months late, but your <i>better</i> world starts here. Just talk to them. They’re ready to listen.</q></p>

<p>Ari began to tremble, and he felt sick in his stomach. A flood of doubts washed over him as he gazed outward. So many people! He didn’t know what to say. Abraham and Suleima were educated; they were the smart ones. He was only a boy from the Iraqi streets. <q>I don’t &hellip;</q></p>

<p>Suleima put a hand on his shoulder. <q>Yes, you do,</q> she said. <q>Speak for your sisters. Say what they can’t say.</q> She leaned close and kissed his cheek.</p>

<p>Ari blushed with embarrassment as he touched the place where her lips had made contact. <q>We started this together,</q> he said finally. <q>Let’s finish it the same way.</q> Laying hands on the shoulders of his friends, he shifted to the stage.</p>

<p>A profound silence fell over the sea of children as expectant faces turned upward. The depth of that silence stunned Ari. His throat went dry. The microphones loomed before him like a metallic forest, and he took a step backward. Suleima slipped her fingers into his. Abraham did the same, and as one they stepped forward again.</p>

<p>Ari swallowed. <q>We have one message to bring, and it’s a simple message.</q> The microphones picked up his voice, magnified it and sent it outward with startling power. <q>We hope you’ll speak that message with us.</q> He swallowed again as he spied the dour face of General Piper near the stage. Ari looked to Abraham for support.</p>

<p>Abraham leaned forward. <q>Ari is from Iraq,</q> he announced. <q>Suleima is from Sudan, and I am from Israel.</q> He waved a hand over the crowd. <q>You are from many places. We want to say to our parents and our leaders—we want a better world.</q></p>

<p>Suleima leaned forward with stern confidence. <q>Stop making war on the children!</q> she demanded.</p>

<p>A loud cheer went up from the masses, and young voices echoed her demand, turned it into a chant that rolled across the mall in endless waves.</p>

<p>Emboldened, Ari looked directly at General Piper as he shouted into the microphones. <q>And if you won’t stop</q>—he thrust a finger at the general—<q>then we’ll stop you! We’ll take away your toys the same way you take away ours! Wherever you send your planes, we’ll send them back. Wherever you send tanks, we’ll send them back. You raise us to be responsible! Now we have to teach you responsibility!</q></p>

<p>The crowd fell silent once again, and Ari hesitated. He wasn’t a speaker. He was just a boy. An orphan. He didn’t know what else to say to so many people. But somewhere down among all those children were others with a power inside them that only needed to be awakened and nurtured. It would take time to find them. Maybe he wasn’t a speaker. But he could be a teacher.</p>

<p><q>I only have one more thing to say,</q> he said, finding strength and resolve again. <q>One month ago, I promised my friends that I’d build a new peace monument on this mall. I mean to keep that promise now.</q></p>

<p>Without another word, Ari shifted, reappearing on an airfield in Hamedan, Iran. Startled soldiers scrambled as he placed a hand on the fuselage of a Shafaq jet fighter, but they were too slow to stop him. He deposited the aircraft at the feet of Lincoln’s statue and, without a pause, shifted again, this time to another airbase at Heliopolis outside of Cairo, Egypt. He touched the wheel of a French-made Mirage 2000 fighter. It was a tremendous weight to shift even for him, and the effort left him panting.</p>

<p>But he wasn’t finished. With Suleima’s help and a library computer, along with lessons his uncle had taught him, he’d made his plans. His next shift took him to Israel’s Southern Infantry Base in Shomryyi. With a wave to a crew of maintenance mechanics, he leaned against one of their prized Merkava Mark IV tanks and shifted.</p>

<p>Ari’s head began to throb, and as he set the heavy tank on the lawn at Lincoln’s feet, he sucked a deep breath. Television crews were closing in, but he beckoned them away. <q>Stay back!</q> he shouted. <q>Leave me room!</q> Then, despite the growing strain, he shifted yet again.</p>

<p>He reappeared at a U.S. base in Asadabad, Afghanistan in Kumar Province. For a brief moment, he thought of a secret jihadist camp not a hundred miles away in the mountains where he’d found and rescued Abraham, but that wasn’t his target this time. Reaching out, he touched an American Stryker fighting vehicle. Someone shouted, and a bullet ricocheted on the pavement. Ari smiled and shifted away.</p>

<p>Back on the mall, the crowds were running to see as people took note of what was happening near the Lincoln Memorial, but Abraham and Suleima were warning them back, and a huge ring was quickly beginning to form.</p>

<p>Sweat poured down Ari’s face, and he cried out with pain as he shifted yet again. An instant later, senses reeling, he fell to his knees on hard-packed earth. <q>Home,</q> he murmured. Weary and aching, he looked up and searched the gloom for the ghosts of his mother and sisters. He heard their whispers in the shadows, and echoes of old laughter, and smelled half-remembered cook-smells over the lingering acrid stench of smoke and fire.</p>

<p>Stubbornly determined, Ari got to his feet and placed one hand against a wall. He sensed its mass just as he had sensed the mass of the fire truck. Then, moving to a corner where the bombs had done the least damage, he stretched out his arms and touched two walls at the same time. With a grimace, squeezing his eyes shut tightly, he shifted.</p>

<p>A warm beam of sunlight on his face caused him to open his eyes again, and he gazed up through the great hole in the roof to the blue sky beyond. Shadows and ghosts were gone. So was his headache and pain. Wiping the sweat from his face, he went to the shattered threshold and stepped out into bright day. A vast ring of silent people and cameras to numerous to count greeted him. Beyond, ominous black vans sat parked, motionless.</p>

<p>The imposing Merkava sat in front of his door, and the sleek fighter jets on either side. Pursing his lips in satisfaction, he walked a few paces over the green grass and turned to see the Stryker in the rear. Finally, he gazed up at Lincoln, all white marble and glittering in the sunlight, then back at his own handiwork.</p>

<p>Four mighty weapons with guns all trained on his small home. It was not an attractive sculpture, Ari thought, but it made his point.</p>
