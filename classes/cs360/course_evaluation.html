    <p>I was fairly disappointed with this course though I consider the issues to largely stem, not from a lack of professional ability on the part of Dr. Biswas, but from the unfortunate combination of a graduate and undergraduate class into a single course.</p>
    <p>The pacing of the information was suitable. The subjects covered were a pretty standard sampling of the field and Dr. Biswas did an acceptable job of combining a comprehensible depth for undergraduates with a more thorough examination in the additional lectures for the graduate students.</p>
    <p>My primary issues with the class were threefold. First, the decision to focus on an Othello playing program for the dominant portion of the programming aspect of the class. Othello playing is an interesting project to give undergraduates a sense of meaning when writing their programs. Rather than simply writing programs that are simply discarded, they get to compete with their classmates. The exact reasons it is a strong teaching tool for undergraduates make it extremely pedagogically inappropriate for graduate students. Graduate students either should, or should be learning to, create meaningful and interesting projects based on their knowledge of the field and personal interests. Forcing them to write a program whose success is largely based on efficiently writing LISP and a knowledge of Othello is not productive to them as learners and disrespectful of their time as professionals.</p>
    <p>In a similar vein, requiring all programming work to be done in LISP was an arguable decision. Certainly the language was once dominant in artificial intelligence research. If it were still so, then forcing students to write mediocre programs in a language they don't know well would make sense. Of the papers we covered in the graduate section on active development in AI, LISP was hardly represented at all. In the field of AI it has largely been outstripped by languages with more extensive library support and better expressive facilities for compact data structures. To require one program to be written in LISP, perhaps as a taste of the LISP methodology, would be fine. Requiring all the assignments, with no direction as to the LISP way of thinking, means most students simply produced a large quantity of inefficient highly procedural LISP code.</p>
    <p>My final issue was with the requirement that students are not permitted to collaborate in any way on homework assignments. Solutions to single problems frequently spanned four or five pages. Creating a concise e-mail that could explain a particular problem was difficult when the issue was buried in several pages of logic with specialized notation. I know that I spent ten hours working unsuccessfully on a single problem because I misunderstood some arguably ambiguous notation in the book. Given that it was nearly impossible to ask a question via e-mail, and Dr. Biswas had two office hours per week, a student's options are fourfold: 1. be brilliant and not misunderstand anything, 2. devote huge amounts of time to completing assignments (upwards of 40-50 hours for an assignment due over the course of a week), 3. fail, 4. cheat. I'm certainly not saying students should be allowed to copy off of each other. However, a student gains nothing wasting their time staring at a problem they have a fundamental misunderstanding of. Any one of the graduate students could easily be out in the real world making tens of thousands of dollars. They have chosen to come here to learn. Disallowing collaboration is to say that if they are allowed to collaborate they would copy each other and not learn the material. I actually learned less because I wasted my time trying to operate with a fundamental misunderstanding that could easily have been corrected by one of my classmates.</p>
    <p>As I said initially, I thought that the information present in this class was well chosen and that the lectures were clear and complete. As a teacher, I respect Dr. Biswas. I got a genuine sense of interest in my performance and a desire to help. My issues are with the fact that several of the structures used to teach the combined undergraduate / graduate course were not at all well suited for adult learners with the capacity to do meaningful work and an active interest in learning. Ultimately, this class required twice as much time as my other classes combined and the amount of useful information I learned was less.</p>

    <h1>Professor Evaluation</h1>
    <p>My opinion on Dr. Biswas is strongly divided. His choice of subjects and lecture skills are solid. His willingness to help students and approachability gave his teaching a personable and entertaining touch. I disagreed strongly however with his choice of out-of-class assignments. They were difficult, but the structure meant that most of the difficulty was artificial and the learning was unrelated to the field of AI.</p>
    <p>I think that most of my issues with his pedagogy however were the result of the course being taught as the combination of a graduate and undergraduate class. Many of the teaching methods were perfectly acceptable when applied to learners without professional experience or skills.</p>
