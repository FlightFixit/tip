        <div class="question">
          <p>Determine the time required to execute the following tasks, given the standard assumptions for applying the GOMS keystroke level model. Use table 7.3 from Heim for the necessary operator times and the equation from the posted lecture notes, Section 1.3.1 Keystroke Level Model.</p>
          <p>Most text editors provide two primary mechanisms for deleting a word from a sentence.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Delete each letter of the word individually by using the delete or backspace key.</li>
            <li>Highlight the word using the mouse and then delete the highlighted section all at once via the delete key.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>"Vanderbilt's football team will definitely win their game against Auburn on October 6, 2007!"</p>
          <p>The task requires the user to delete the word "definitely" from the sentence above and replace it with word "not."</p>
        </div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <div class="question">
              <p>Before you complete the analysis, which of the above methods for deleting text do you believe will be faster for an expert typist and why?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>An expert typist will almost always be slowed down by having to take their hands off the keyboard. Even if the time required to perform the actions is the same there is a slight mental shift in finding the cursor on the screen and manipulating it. People who spend a lot of time editing test on a computer are more likely to be familiar with shortcuts for selecting entire words such as holding control and shift and using the arrow keys, or double clicking on the word. Both of these methods would be significantly faster than the mentioned methods.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <p>The Microsoft toolbars allow the user to display a label below each tool icon. Why can the labeled tools be accessed faster than the non-labeled tools? Assume that the user knows the tool and does not need the label to identify the tool icon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>The brain is trained in the recognition of words. Decoding the meaning of icons, particularly if they are especially small, can take slightly more time. Words can be sized smaller while maintaining readability.</p>

            <div class="question">
              <p>If you are talking to someone on the phone and they give you a phone number to call, how do you remember the number when you do not have access to paper and pen or some other mechanism for recording the information, in other words, you have to keep the number in your head. Why does this technique work in relationship to how human memory works?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>I repeat the number until I have a chance to write it down. I group the numbers into the standard 3,3,4 configuration and pay particular attention to the first element of each set. Once the set is started correctly, it somehow makes remembering the last part easier. If I am going to have to retain the number for a period of time I may employ other mnemonic devices such as visualizing the relationships between the numbers or associating the area code with the state the number is in.</p>
