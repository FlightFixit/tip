    <p>Sandy <em>met</em> my expectations as a team member.</p>
    <p>Sandy's contributions to the projects included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Project Design &mdash; As the team member with more experience in the field of robotics and the design of robotic control systems, Sandy was responsible for more of the design decisions. The choice of software packages and languages was his.</li>
      <li>Implementation &mdash; Sandy did the bulk of the programming for the project implementation. The technologies he chose: Player, C++, OpenGL, QT, etc. were all systems that he had prior experience with and I had none.</li>
      <li>Testing &mdash; Sandy did relatively little either with the test design or execution.</li>
      <li>Data Analysis &mdash; Sandy did the actual mathematical analysis of the data generated from testing.</li>
      <li>Final Presentation &mdash; Sandy focused primarily on the presentation of the system implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <p>I believe I <em>met</em> Sandy's expectations as a team member.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Project Design &mdash; I had input into the design, but primarily from a user interface perspective.</li>
      <li>Implementation &mdash; I created the bulk of the resources needed by the program: images, maps, icons, etc. I did a certain amount of testing.</li>
      <li>Testing &mdash; I conducted all of the user evaluations and found all of the test subjects other than one. I wrote the system for doing user evaluations.</li>
      <li>Data Analysis &mdash; I generated much of the raw data for analysis by processing the various raw output files.</li>
      <li>Final Presentation &mdash; I focused on the introduction, and presentation and interpretation of the data.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <p>Overall, I feel that the work was fairly evenly divided on this project. Rather than dividing it across phases, Sandy doing the implementation and I the testing, I would have preferred to have it divided within elements. This might well have been met with more difficulty however. Sandy and I develop in fundamentally different ways. I tend to refactor earlier which, for this project and its extremely short development timeline, would likely have been counterproductive. The end product would have been more robust and testable, but it could have taken longer to implement.</p>
    <p>Sandy and I are both experienced developers with unfortunately different design methodologies. There were occasional periods of conflict and almost open hostility through the course of the semester. These were exacerbated in part by a difference in workload. As best I can tell, Sandy works a minimum of 60-70 hours every week. He had his research as his other major time commitment. I attempted to keep up with him and found it deleterious both to my performance in other classes and to my health and happiness.</p>
