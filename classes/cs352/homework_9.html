    <div class="question">
      <p>The lecture focuses on quality of service as it relates to human-computer interaction, rather network traffic and processing speed. Please watch the video at: <a href="http://www.prop.org/prop2/video/">www.prop.org/prop2/video/</a>. Your task is to identify quality of service issues for the humans interacting with this system, where the female represents the peer user and the male represents the remote user. Please list at least five HCI related quality of service issues and explain why they would have an effect on the user. You may also access other information of the Personal Roving Presence (PRoP) website.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The pole which supports the camera and monitor seemed to frequently flex as the robot moved. This would cause the camera view to sway which could be disorienting for the remote user.</li>
        <li>The size of the monitor is relatively small for the peer user. Ostensibly the point in having a monitor on the device is to allow the remote user to interact visually with the peer user and at the screen's current size it did not seem terribly well suited to showing any level of detail such as would be needed to read facial expressions or view schematics.</li>
        <li>The pointer control looked very rough. It is unclear how the remote user knows what the pointer is aimed at. The laser pointer mentioned makes more sense, but that requires the peer user to be between the PRoP and what is being indicated (or else they won't be able to see the indicator).</li>
        <li>The spacial presence of the user seems limited. It is unclear how directly in front of them they can see to avoid obstacles. Also one of the pictures shows some wires extending higher than the camera lens. Particularly if the remote user had the camera pointed down to avoid floor obstacles it seems plausible that they might run the camera into an overhanging obstacle and potentially knock PRoP down.</li>
        <li>There isn't any indication that a remote user has any control over the volume. In environments where there is high noise, more volume might be needed, but in crowded situations where multiple PRoPs are in use, it could potentially become cacophonous.</li>
