      <p>One tool in repertoire of software developers is developing a scenario detailing a typical use of the software product. This helps identify potential requirements for the system as well as identify the proper fit of the product into the process for the task to perform. This is a scenario detailing an attack on Nashville, Tennessee with a focus on the software used in the control of unmanned vehicles.</p>

    <hr />

    <p><span class="time">09:35</span> &mdash; 911 calls start arriving from the area around the Bell South building reporting a massive explosion. Initial indications point to a single large explosion causing some damage and fatalities, but no building collapses. Police, ambulances and firefighters are immediately dispatched to the area to begin evacuating people.</p>

    <div class="qs">
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In certain circumstances the area would be quarantine and a perimeter enforced. What are the criteria for such an action?</li>
        <li>In the case there is an agent present that warrants a quarantine, one would want it in place as soon as possible. What is the general time period for making the decision?</li>
        <li>How are the movement of initial support personnel restricted by a quarantine? A bomb would likely start fires, how are those put out? Do they use the forest fire planes?</li>
        <li>How are the people trying to leave the quarantine area dealt with?</li>
        <li>How big an area would be quarantined in this situation?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p><span class="time">09:45</span> &mdash; The hierarchical structure for dealing with this type of scenario is largely established. These people are responsible for managing the organization that will respond to the event and whose priorities are determining:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What exactly has happened?</li>
      <li>Is the event isolated?</li>
      <li>What is the extent of the damage?</li>
      <li>Are there any lingering agents present at the scene that pose a danger to the victims or responders?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><span class="time">10:00</span> &mdash; Area police and National Guardsmen begin establishing internment areas. People from within the quarantine area are taken to these areas for interviewing and medical screening. People arriving from outside the area trying to find loved ones are directed to these.</p>

    <p><span class="time">10:30</span> &mdash; Three unmanned vehicle operators arrive from a local military base along with six ground-based and three aerial unmanned vehicles. While the hazmat equipment is being set up, these are deployed into the hot zone to help gather more information. The questions they are trying to answer is to aid in the organization of the human task forces, specifically:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Bomb Squad: Are there any secondary devices?</li>
      <li>Hazardous Materials: Did the bomb release (either actively or inadvertently) any toxic materials that will require modifying the response plan?</li>
      <li>Search and Rescue: Are there incapacitated survivors? What is the state of the rescue environment?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tasks to be performed are arriving for the robots team from higher in the operations command chain. There are three areas where there is a probability of other devices and samples to be collected from the area surrounding the explosion. Additionally aerial maps of the area and people who are in the quarantined area need to be generated to help response personnel move around. The operator pulls up a map of Nashville in the orchestration interface and marks the perimeter of the quarantine then she marks the areas designated for secondary device search and marks that it is a search task. Then she delineates the general area of the actual explosion and creates a a task for the samples to be collected. She also marks the areas of the internment centers for a secondary device search but marks the tasks with a low priority level.</p>

    <div class="qs">
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Where will these robots be living?</li>
        <li>Will the operators be military?</li>
        <li>How long does an evacuation like this take? Are the robots likely fighting for space on the road?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p><em>In an ideal situation the operator would get at least a partial task definition list in an electronic format. The people planning the response would have outlined the areas they wanted searched on a computer and just sent the information electronically. Also, if there are standard best practices for different activities, the tasks would be defined in terms of those best practices and that information would be accessible through the interface.</em></p>

    <div class="qs">
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What sorts of tasks will be defined that are non-localized?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p><span class="time">10:35</span> &mdash; The operator drags a box around a group of robots to create a team for one of the tasks. She designates the task and a goal point for them to navigate to. She does this for another group and for this one she sets waypoints to guide the robots away from a street where aerial photos show a car accident blocking the road. The last group she sets waypoints that will cause them to pass by a border of the area marked for radiological testing so that they can pick up readings.</p>

    <p><span class="time">10:45</span> &mdash; The second group arrives first at their goal point and she switches the manipulation interface to focus on an individual robot. She begins the process of using its arm to collect a soil sample. While she is doing this, there is a flash in the status boxes for the robots. One is highlighted and she sees that it has gotten stuck. She switches to that robot and helps get it going again before switching back to the soil collection.</p>

    <p><span class="time">10:55</span> &mdash; Once the collection is done she switches back to the manipulation interface, sets the robot with the sample to return and looks for a task close to the robots' location to send them. Once they're moving, she sees that the first group has arrived at its destination and switches to deal individually with those robots. Her work continues like this for several hours with new tasks coming in and switching between the orchestration interface for specifying tasks and moving robots around the city, and the manipulation interface used for manipulating individual robots.</p>

    <p>There are times when robots on a high priority task need to move from one area to another. While they're moving she works with another robot but has the positions map overlaid over her work translucently. This lets her track the positions of the whole world while primarily focusing on operating a specific robot.</p>

    <p><em>A major weakness of this interface is the single operator. One of the advantages of electronic task capture, in addition to allowing more precise specification down the chain of command, is once the tasks are specified multiple operators can work in parallel to complete them. Supporting operators can choose open tasks and do the work of teleoperating robots to help make up for any deficiencies in the autonomous control. There's a limit to the number of tasks a brain can be asked to track simultaneously regardless of the ease of information retrieval from the interface. To keep nine robots working productively consistently there either has to be a pretty high level of autonomy in the robots or multiple operators have to work in parallel.</em></p>
