      <h1>CS-352 &mdash; Robot Control Interface Requirements</h1>
      <h2>Sanford Freeman and Will Holcomb</h2>
      <h2>21 September 2007</h2>
    </div>

    <h2>Audience Definition</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Primary Users: The operators responsible for coordinating the activities of unmanned vehicles in a response to a chemical or explosives disaster event. The program will generally be working from the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) which will be stationed at the perimeter established around the event. The operator will not necessarily have any knowledge of the terrain the robots are navigating over. The operators will be trained emergency response personnel with a specific training using the interface.</li>
      <li>Stakeholders: The Human-Machine Teaming Lab directing the development of this project. This project will be the basis of research into effective methods for heterogeneous ground and aerial multirobot control.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Requirement Types</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Robotic Interface &mdash; Hardware requirement</li>
      <li>Control &mdash; Operator control requirement</li>
      <li>Scenario &mdash; Requirement pertaining to the task being tested</li>
      <li>Data &mdash; Requirements for data from the environment to be presented to the operator</li>

      <li>Developer Specified Requirements:
      <ul>
        <li>
        <ul>
          <li>Requirement ID: 13</li>
          <li>Requirement Type: Data</li>
          <li>Description: Operator is able to quickly assess the status of an individual robot</li>
          <li>Rationale: In order to effectively control large groups of mobile robots, the operator must be able to tightly monitor their operation.</li>
          <li>Validation Measurement: Add 10 robots to the interface and confirm that the operator can toggle between robots with minimal delay and effort.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <ul>
          <li>Requirement ID: 14</li>
          <li>Requirement Type: Data</li>
          <li>Description: Interface must assist the operator in maintaining appropriate situational awareness</li>
          <li>Rationale: High levels of situational awareness are required to perform this task.</li>
          <li>Validation Measurement: Due to design time constraints, a SAGAT test will not be performed, but testable responses will be used.  Additionally, a subjective measures test will also be conducted, possibly a SART test.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <ul>
          <li>Requirement ID: 15</li>
          <li>Requirement Type: Data</li>
          <li>Description: Alert the operator of unexpected events that require attention</li>
          <li>Rationale: Controlling large groups of mobile robots is a challenging task because they are frequently situated in complex and highly dynamic environments.  Additionally, mobile robots can themselves be complex and dynamic.  This dynamic nature can cause frequent unexpected error conditions to occur which require immediate attention.</li>
          <li>Validation Measurement: Simulate several error conditions and confirm that the interface provides messaging of some form to the operator.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
