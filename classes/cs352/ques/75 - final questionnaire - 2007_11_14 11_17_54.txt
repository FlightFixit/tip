LikeMost: I can see the view of the robot and the map at the same time. The overlaid strategy is very helpful.

The task is easy to add.

The manipulation of the robot by adding task saves time and effort.
LikeLeast: The bomb and chemical areas after searching should be painted with a different color, so that I can know which areas I have been searched for.

When the robot is stuck, I cannot know it soon.
