form_name: final questionnaire

LikeMost: 1) the auto waypoints
2) the orchestration view
3) the ability to intuitively change between robots
LikeLeast: 1) not being able to drive in orchestration mode
2) robot not have panoramic camera (to speed of the bomb search instead of waiting to turn the whole robot)
3) the robots ability to \"get hanged up\"
Comments: the robots are very hard to control when stuck on something
The ability to plot obstacles in the orchestration view to decrease the number of hang up when using waypoints would be helpful
