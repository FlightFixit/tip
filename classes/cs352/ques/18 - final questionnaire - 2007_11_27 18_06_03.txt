form_name: final questionnaire
uid: 18
LikeMost: kinda intuitive

the waypoint eases me

the status bar 
LikeLeast: i wish the feeds are nicer. that way i can identify the bomb easier if i dont have the bomb detector

collecting samples taking too much time

controlling is kinda difficult
Comments: erm, overall rating is 15 out of 20, but i can be improved with more convenient toolbars and controls. and the robots color (active) is kinda confusing
