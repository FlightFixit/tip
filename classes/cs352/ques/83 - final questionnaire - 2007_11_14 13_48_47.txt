LikeMost: 1. Orchestration view overlayed on the individual robots was a good idea.

2. Giving each robot a task list.

3. The interface wasn\'t modal, so nothing popped up that prevented me from doing the \"top\" priority task.
LikeLeast: 1. Orchestration overlay could not be adjusted or faded.

2. No \"alerts\" of robots stuck or other robots idling so I could deal with the situation.

3. Not enough state indicators on the screen for whether a robot was under automatic control or manual, etc.
Comments: The orchestration overlay is a good idea, but it would be nice to be able to fade it, or for it to \"smart\" fade in the center of view, so as to not obstruct robot views(see Diablo 2\'s automap overlay actually).

It would be nice to detect when the robots are \"stuck\" or when they complete their current tasks list and display this as an flashing indicator (which can be SILENCED, and maybe a quick key to unsilence all) so robots which need attention can be flagged.

Also, this might benefit from a 2 person interface where high level things are handled and individual robot driving by one person but another person can passively monitor the robot views and help direct the person doing the high level views(and perhaps with the permission of the main user, be given control over a robot as well).

Also, it might be nice to have a \"3d\" overlay mode where bounds of areas-of-interest are real-time \"drawn\" in the camera views(even if imprecise this would be a nice cue).

In addition to waypoints, it would be nice to have a \"sweep\" type command which would have the robot slowly drive through an area and pan so that it can be watched by a human observer who is control OTHER robots/actions.
