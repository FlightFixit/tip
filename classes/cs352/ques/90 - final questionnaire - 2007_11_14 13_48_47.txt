LikeMost: Autopilot on the rare occasion that it didn\'t hump invisible polygons in the street.
Using random obstacles as tools to increase my spin speed when I was too bored to wait for a robot to turn.


LikeLeast: The robots constantly getting stuck on invisible obstacles and spinning really fast.
Having the selected robot be pink and the nonselected robot red.
Not being able to assign/delete tasks on the overlay, why is it there if I can\'t use it.
