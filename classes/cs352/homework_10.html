    <div class="question">
      <p>You are to provide the following for one user interface feature for your project. Please ensure that the chosen feature is not the same as your partner's.</p>
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <div class="question">
          <p>Please provide a detailed description (e.g. manual/tutorial) on the feature. Include the purpose of the feature, how it is to be used for its intended purpose, and any required syntax.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Within our interface, one of the views the user has available is called the "orchestration interface." The function of the interface is the coordination and manipulation of multiple unmanned vehicles in response to a disaster situation. The orchestration view gives the user a two-dimensional map of the area where the robots are operating and allows selecting and guiding them. For example, the map might look like:</p>
          <object id="map" type="image/svg+xml" data="interface/src/images/scenario_map.svg"></object>
          <p>The interface allows overlays of important information to be added. For example, one overlay is areas where other response personnel have requested samples be taken. When this overlay is activated, the previous example would look like:</p>
          <object id="map" type="image/svg+xml" data="interface/src/images/chem_over.svg"></object>
          <p>Within the orchestration interface robots are represented by the following image:</p>
          <object class="interface" type="image/svg+xml" data="interface/src/images/robot_image.svg"></object>
          <p>The arrow represents the front of the robot. At any given time there is an active robot that will receive any new commands. The color filling the robot is purple and all other robots are filled with red.</p>
          <p>There are three tasks that it is possible to give a robot:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Waypoint: A position on the map that the robot should drive to. The robot will drive in a straight line from its current position to the next waypoint. Multiple waypoints may be specified and will be executed in sequence.</li>
            <li>Collect Chemical Sample: A position on the map that the robot should drive to and collect a chemical sample.</li>
            <li>Collect Dirt Sample: A position on the map that the robot should drive to and collect a dirt sample.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Tasks are created by right-clicking on the map and selecting <code>Add Task</code> from the menu that comes up. From the associated dialog, the user may select which robot to create a task for (the active robot is the default) and may select the type of task to create.</p>
          <p>Tasks within the interface are represented by small circles of different colors: yellow for waypoint, green for chemical samples and brown for dirt samples. Lines are drawn between the tasks in the order they will be executed representing the path the robot will follow while executing the tasks.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">
          <p>Please describe how you would create a tutorial for this feature. The tutorial may be an interactive tutorial or a demonstration. What would be included in the tutorial and how.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>I would do an interactive tutorial. The user would be instructed on how to activate the requested chemical samples interface and then stepped through the process for creating waypoints to guide the robot into position and collecting a sample.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="question">
          <p>Please describe the necessary context-sensitive help, including the type of context-sensitive help to be provided.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Context sensitive help is useful in the map for providing more detail about certain agents and tasks. When a user hovers over a robot more extensive information about the robot and its currently assigned tasks is shown. Also when hovering over a task, the interface could, but does not currently, show information about the robot the task is assigned to and the expected time to completion.</p>
