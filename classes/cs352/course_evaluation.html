    <p>The project-based structure of this course was very productive. Examining user evaluation from with the project design perspective helped to both concretize and contextualize the information presented. The combination of two essentially different tasks, user evaluations for software design and user evaluations for statistical study &mdash; two activities with different requirements and processes &mdash; was a bit artificial. Given the time constraints of the course however, I don't know that there is a reasonable alternative.</p>

    <h1>Professor Evaluation</h1>
    <p>Dr. Adams was available throughout the term for consultation on issues surrounding the projects. Her structuring of the course was conducive to maintaining a steady but reasonable workload.</p>
