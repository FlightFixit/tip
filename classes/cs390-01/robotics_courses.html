              <li><strong>Description</strong>: This course presents an overview of robotics in practice and research with topics including vision, motion planning, mobile mechanisms, kinematics, inverse kinematics, and sensors. In course projects, students construct robots which are driven by a microcontroller, with each project reinforcing the basic principles developed in lectures. Students nominally work in teams of three: an electrical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and a computer scientist. This course will also expose students to some of the contemporary happenings in robotics, which includes current robot lab research, applications, robot contests and robots in the news.</li>

              <li><strong>Description</strong>: Today's robots replace, assist, or entertain humans in many tasks. Recent examples of robots are planetary rovers, robot pets, medical surgical assistive devices, and semi-autonomous ground vehicles for search and rescue operations. The goal of this class is to introduce the students to the common kinematic and computational principles of the above examples and to provide them with hands-on experience with state of the art mobile robots and manipulators. The three main topics are coordinate system transformations and kinematics, visual sensing for localization, and computational geometry for motion planning. Laboratories involve building and programming Lego Mindstorms as well as using a manipulator and a haptic device.</li>
              <li><strong>Project</strong>: The course description mentions mindstorms, but the homepage and projects describes a robot based around the <a href="http://www.icoptech.com/products_detail.asp?ProductID=271">ICOP EBox</a> minicomputer. There is no overarching project. Students do labs on the subjects of <a href="http://fling-l.seas.upenn.edu/~cse390/wiki/?n=Main.Projects?action=download&amp;upname=2007_lab01.pdf">the EBox</a>, </a><a href="http://fling-l.seas.upenn.edu/~cse390/wiki/?n=Main.Projects?action=download&amp;upname=2007_lab02.pdf">vision</a> and <a href="http://fling-l.seas.upenn.edu/~cse390/wiki/?n=Main.Projects?action=download&amp;upname=2007_lab03.pdf">navigation</a>.</li>

              <li><strong>Description</strong>: How do robots function autonomously in dynamic, unpredictable environments? This course focuses on programming mobile robots, such as the iRobot Roomba, to perceive and act autonomously in real-world environments. The major paradigms for autonomous control and robot perception are examined and compared with robotic notions in science fiction.</li>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Description</strong>: This project course is a hand-on introduction to robotics. The course will introduce students to the basic concepts in robotics, focusing on the mechanics, and electronic principles behind building robots and on the classic algorithms, architectures, and theories behind controlling and programming robots. Topics include: basic mechanics, basic electronics, control architectures (planning, subsumptionism, and behavior-based robotics), configuration sensing, motion planning, uncertainty in robotics, map making, grasping, manipulation, shape and object recognition, distributed robotics, and applications of robotics. Students will build a robot in teams using a robot building kit. They will use this robot to implement the algorithms discussed in class in the context of a concrete task (for example, a robo-rat system for the foraging task).</li>

              <li><strong>Description</strong>: This course is designed to provide a forum for applying and testing artificial intelligence methods and models, especially behavior-based techniques, on a robot. While models will be evaluated with respect to their theoretical tenability (i.e., conceptual clarity, support by empirical data, plausibility), most emphasis will be given to issues of practicality (i.e., feasibility of implementation, real-time/real-world issues, computational resources, etc.). These practical considerations will be extensively studied in simulations as well as real-world implementations on a variety of robots. Implementations might also comprise new ideas hopefully giving rise to original research results</li>

The course adopts a low threshold, no ceiling philosophy. This means that the course is designed to be inclusive of students with limited formal training while still providing significant challenges for those with greater preparation and/or motivation. Students will be required to create control programs for a mobile autonomous robot. In each course unit, the problems posed will become increasingly more challenging. Coaching, advising, and instruction are done online via chat interfaces. Student code is tested first in a simulator that we provide and then on a real robot whose activity can be monitored remotely via a web cam.</li>
