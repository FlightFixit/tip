      <h1>Introduction to Robotics &mdash; Book Reviews</h1>
    </div>
    
    <p>Four books are under consideration for the introduction to robotics course:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>B &mdash; Bekey, George A. (2005). <cite>Autonomous Robots: From Biological Inspiration to Implementation and Control</cite>. The MIT Press.</li>
      <li>SN &mdash; Siegwart, Roland &amp; Nourbakhsh, Illah R. (2004). <cite>Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robotics</cite>. The MIT Press.</li>
      <li>N &mdash; Nehmzow, Ulrich (2003). <cite>Mobile Robotics: A Practical Introduction</cite> (2nd ed.). Springer.</li>
      <li>DJ &mdash; Dudek, Gregory &amp; Jenkin, Michael (2000). <cite>Computational Principles of Mobile Robotics</cite>. Cambridge University Press.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Introduction, What Is Robotics?, Motivation
      <p>What I was looking for was essentially two high-level stories. One, a story of robotics; who came up with the idea, how things progressed, where we're at today, and where we might be going. Also, I wanted a parallel overview of the state of the art of robotic control solutions; purely teleoperated to functional control to behavior-based to higher levels of autonomy. Something to give a student both an idea of why these problems are interesting and also an overview of the state of the art.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>B 1 &mdash; Recent examples, control flow diagrams, biological metaphors. An engineering perspective but with some societal understanding.</li>
        <li>N 2 &mdash; Good coverage of evolution of control systems. Old examples.</li>
        <li>SN 1 &mdash; Lots of pictures. Very little history.</li>
        <li>DJ 1 &mdash; Old examples, emphasizes the mobile robotics context.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Locomotion
      <p>Looking for a description of locomotion kinematics and transformations of reference frames. Also the basic types of locomotive actuators and their characteristics.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>DJ 2 &mdash; Fewer types of wheels, focuses on other environments such as space and submarine. Explanations aren't as deep, but more approachable.</li>
        <li>SN 2 &mdash; Very comprehensive listing with extensive mathematical details. Very little explanation, really a better reference than a learning text.</li>
        <li>B 7, 8, &amp; 9 &mdash; Extensive examples of many types including several biomimetic machines such as fish-modeled submarines and brachiating chimp-modeled swingers, also UAV examples. Entire chapter on bipedal locomotion. Second chapter on tri- and greater pedal locomotion. Nothing about wheels.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Kinematics
      <p>Looking for an understanding of how motion of the robots actuators affect the robot's position. Potentially as well a description of how manipulator actions should be controlled.</p>
