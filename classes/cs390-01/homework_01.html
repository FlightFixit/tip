      <h2>Homework #1: Robot Simulation</h2>
      <h2>Due: 14:35 Thrs., 31 January 2008</h2>
    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>All work should be done on your own and any collaboration or additional resources should be indicated on your assignment.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>For research purposes robotocists will at times use simulators to test their algorithms in simulators which give them an increased ability to control and monitor the robot's environment. There are a few popular simulation platforms. This assignment is going to focus specifically on Microsoft's Robotics Studio. To begin, download the Robotics Studio from:</p>
    <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/robotics/">msdn.microsoft.com/robotics/</a></p>
    
    <p>Microsoft has created extensive tutorials for certain aspects of simulator. These tutorials are available in the documentation installed as "Documentation" in the program's folder. The specific tutorials that are pertinent to this assignment are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Microsoft Visual Simulation Environment &rarr; Simulation Tutorials &rarr; C# &rarr; Simulation Tutorial 1 (C#) - Introduction to the Simulation Runtime
        <p>The simulator comes with a fairly complex graphical environment for creating operational links between components. Both because of the complexity of the algorithms we will be using and because we will be moving away from working with Robotics Studio, we are not going to focus on this visual environment. Instead we will be programming using one the the .NET compatible languages.</p>
        <p>This tutorial covers the basics of loading the simulation environment and running C# programs. Any languages compatible with the .NET runtime should work in the place of C#.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Microsoft Visual Simulation Environment &rarr; Simulation Tutorials &rarr; C# &rarr; Simulation Tutorial 2 (C#) - Compose Entities with Simulation Services
        <p>This tutorial involves inserting pre-made geometries into the simulation as well as creating a differential drive by composing sensors. You should complete this tutorial. There is an issue though that the geometry used in this tutorial is for a Pioneer. We will be working initially with the Lego Tribot robot. Redo this tutorial, but replace the robot's geometry with the Lego Tribot. Then create a scene with the new Tribot and three tables placed at random.</p>
        <p><em>ToDo: Find the name of the Tribot's geometry class in Robotics Studio.</em></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The previous tutorials only allowed controlling the robot manually. For the final element of this assignment, make your robot start moving when the program starts. The robot should move forward five meters, stop, turn 180&deg; and return. Instructions on how to activate the motors can be found at:</p>

    <h2>Artifacts</h2>

    <p>Your grade for this assignment will be based on the submission of:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>A screen shot of your robot in its environment</li>
      <li>Your final source code that composes a Lego Tribot and causes it to move spontaneously in an environment with at least three tables in relatively close proximity</li>
    </ol>
