    <p>This obviously broken system exists because of the investment markets. The markets exist to provide capital to the production system. My idea is to make the system of production transparent and come up with a new way to distribute capital.</p>

    <p>While some system of transparency could be devised for our current banking industry, a simpler way is to use bitcoin. Every bitcoin transaction is known to the entire network. By keeping metainformation about the transactions we could build a picture of how the system is functioning.</p>
