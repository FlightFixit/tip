    <p>This graph shows a broken system:</p>

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../image/chart/global%20distribution%20of%20wealth/"/>

    <p>A major part of the issue is the investment market. Investment is paying for providing money. When we pay people for having money, not surprisingly you end up with a geometric progression:</p>

    <object height="400px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../image/graph/l-curve/"/>

    <p>We need resources to be comfortable. These are provided for us by the supply chain:</p>

    <object height="300px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../image/chart/supply chain/"/>

    <p>In order for the supply chain to function, the component companies sometimes need to expand. Capital to support this expansion is what the investment market supplies:</p>

    <object height="450px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../image/chart/investment market/"/>

    <p>The best known alternative to this is Communism where a bureaucracy oversees the system of production:</p>

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../image/chart/communism/"/>

    <p>My proposal is that we build a model of the economy and consumer desire, and use it to inform fairer and more efficient markets:</p>

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../image/chart/technoanarchy/"/>

    <p>A major issue, currently, is most of the data is siloed in individual corporations:</p>

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../image/chart/data silos/"/>

    <p>There is optimization within each company, but nothing across the system:</p>

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../"/>

    <p>I want to make the data public and allow computers to try to optimize budgets across organizations:</p>

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../"/>

    <p>I'd like to start with a restaurant. Create software to compute prices to run the business at-cost and make all the operational data public.</p>

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../"/>
 
    <p>Next take that software and use it in multiple locations. Workers would have transferable work reputations allowing them to work at any location.</p>

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../"/>

    <p>Combine this with a corresponding hostels and workers can schedule working tours of the world.</p>

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../"/>

    <p>From there the restaurants would try to use their market influence to spread the publicity of data down the supply chain.</p>    

    <object height="550px" type="image/svg+xml" data=".../"/>
