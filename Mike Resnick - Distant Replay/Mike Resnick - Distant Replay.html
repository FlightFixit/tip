<h1>Distant Replay</h1>
<h2>by Mike Resnick</h2>

<p>The first time I saw her she was jogging in the park. I was sitting on a bench, reading the paper like I do every morning. I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to her, except to note the resemblance.</p>

<p>The next time was in the supermarket. I&rsquo;d stopped by to replenish my supply of instants&mdash;coffee, creamer, sweetener&mdash;and this time I got a better look at her. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. At seventy-six, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time that had happened.</p>

<p>Two nights later I was in Vincenzo&rsquo;s Ristorante, which has been my favorite Italian joint for maybe forty years&mdash;and there she was again. Not only that, but this time she was wearing my favorite blue dress. Oh, the skirt was a little shorter, and there was something different about the sleeves, but it was the dress, all right.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t make any sense. She hadn&rsquo;t looked like this in more than four decades. She&rsquo;d been dead for seven years, and if she was going to come back from the grave, why the hell hadn&rsquo;t she come directly to me? After all, we&rsquo;d spent close to half a century together.</p>

<p>I walked by her, ostensibly on my way to the men&rsquo;s room, and the smell hit me while I was still five feet away from her. It was the same perfume she&rsquo;d worn every day of our lives together.</p>

<p>But she was sixty-eight when she&rsquo;d died, and now she looked exactly the way she looked the very first time I saw her. I tried to smile at her as I passed her table. She looked right through me.</p>

<p>I got to the men&rsquo;s room, rinsed my face off, and took a look in the mirror, just to make sure I was still seventy-six years old and hadn&rsquo;t dreamed the last half century. It was me, all right: not much hair on the top, in need of a trim on the sides, one eye half-shut from the mini-stroke I denied having except in increasingly rare moments of honesty, a tiny scab on my chin where I&rsquo;d cut myself shaving. (I can&rsquo;t stand those new-fangled electric razors, though since they&rsquo;ve been around as long as I have, I guess they&rsquo;re not really so new-fangled after all.)</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t much of a face on good days, and now it had just seen a woman who was the spitting image of Deirdre.</p>

<p>When I came out she was still there, sitting alone, picking at her dessert.</p>

<p><q>Excuse me,</q> I said, walking up to her table. <q>Do you mind if I join you for a moment?</q></p>

<p>She looked at me as if I was half-crazy. Then she looked around, making sure that the place was crowded in case she had to call for help, decided I looked harmless enough, and finally she nodded tersely.</p>

<p><q>Thank you,</q> I said. <q>I just want to say that you look exactly like someone I used to know, even down to the dress and the perfume.</q></p>

<p>She kept staring at me, but didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>

<p><q>I should introduce myself,</q> I said, extending my hand. <q>My name is Walter Silverman.</q></p>

<p><q>What do you want?</q> she asked, ignoring my hand.</p>

<p><q>The truth?</q> I said. <q>I just wanted a closer look at you. You remind me so much of this other person.</q> She looked dubious. <q>It&rsquo;s not a pick-up line,</q> I continued. <q>Hell, I&rsquo;m old enough to be your grandfather, and the staff will tell you I&rsquo;ve been coming here for forty years and haven&rsquo;t molested any customers yet. I&rsquo;m just taken by the resemblance to someone I cared for very much.</q></p>

<p>Her face softened. <q>I&rsquo;m sorry if I was rude,</q> she said, and I was struck by how much the voice sounded like <i>her</i> voice. <q>My name is Deirdre.</q></p>

<p>It was my turn to stare.</p>

<p><q>Are you all right?</q> she asked.</p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m fine,</q> I said. <q>But the woman you look like was also named Deirdre.</q></p>

<p>Another stare.</p>

<p><q>Let me show you,</q> I said, pulling out my wallet. I took my Deirdre&rsquo;s photo out and handed it to her.</p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s uncanny,</q> she said, studying the picture. <q>We even sort of wear our hair the same way. When was this taken?</q></p>

<p><q>Forty-seven years ago.</q></p>

<p><q>Is she dead?</q></p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p><q>Your wife?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes.</q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m sorry,</q> she said. <q>She was a beautiful woman.</q> Then, <q>I hope that doesn&rsquo;t sound conceited, since we look so much alike.</q></p>

<p><q>Not at all. She <i>was</i> beautiful. And like I say, she even used the same perfume.</q></p>

<p><q>That&rsquo;s very weird,</q> she said. <q>Now I understand why you wanted to talk to me.</q></p>

<p><q>It was like &hellip; like I&rsquo;d suddenly stumbled back half a century in time,</q> I said. <q>You&rsquo;re even wearing Deedee&rsquo;s favorite color.</q></p>

<p><q>What did you say?</q></p>

<p><q>That you&rsquo;re wearing her&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>No. I meant what you just called her.</q></p>

<p><q>Deedee?</q> I asked. <q>That was my pet name for her.</q></p>

<p><q>My friends call <i>me</i> Deedee,</q> she said. <q>Isn&rsquo;t that odd?</q></p>

<p><q>May I call you that?</q> I said. <q>If we ever meet again, I mean?</q></p>

<p><q>Sure,</q> she said with a shrug. <q>Tell me about yourself, Walter. Are you retired?</q></p>

<p><q>For the past dozen years,</q> I said.</p>

<p><q>Got any kids or grandkids?</q></p>

<p><q>No.</q></p>

<p><q>If you don&rsquo;t work and you don&rsquo;t have family, what do you do with your time?</q> she asked.</p>

<p><q>I read, I watch DVDs, I take walks, I Google a zillion things of interest on the computer.</q> I paused awkwardly. <q>I hope it doesn&rsquo;t sound crazy, but mostly I just pass the time until I can be with Deedee again.</q></p>

<p><q>How long were you married?</q></p>

<p><q>Forty-five years,</q> I answered. <q>That photo was taken a couple of years before we were married. We had long engagements back then.</q></p>

<p><q>Did she work?</q> asked Deirdre. <q>I know a lot of women didn&rsquo;t when you were young.</q></p>

<p><q>She illustrated children&rsquo;s books,</q> I said. <q>She even won a couple of awards.</q></p>

<p>Suddenly Deirdre frowned. <q>All right, Walter&mdash;how long have you been studying me?</q></p>

<p><q>Studying you?</q> I repeated, puzzled. <q>I saw you jogging a couple of days ago, and I watched you while I was eating&hellip; .</q></p>

<p><q>Do you really expect me to believe that?</q></p>

<p><q>Why wouldn&rsquo;t you?</q> I asked.</p>

<p><q>Because I&rsquo;m an illustrator for children&rsquo;s magazines.</q></p>

<p>That was <i>too</i> many coincidences. <q>Say that again?</q></p>

<p><q>I illustrate children&rsquo;s magazines.</q></p>

<p><q>What&rsquo;s your last name?</q> I asked.</p>

<p><q>Why?</q> she replied suspiciously.</p>

<p><q>Just tell me,</q> I said, almost harshly.</p>

<p><q>Aronson.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank God!</q></p>

<p><q>What are you talking about?</q></p>

<p><q>My Deedee&rsquo;s maiden name was Kaplan,</q> I said. <q>For a minute there I thought I was going crazy. If your name was Kaplan I&rsquo;d have been sure of it.</q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m sorry I lost my temper,</q> said Deirdre. <q>This has been just a little . . . well &hellip; weird.</q></p>

<p><q>I didn&rsquo;t mean to upset you,</q> I said. <q>It was just, I don&rsquo;t know, like seeing my Deedee all over again, young and beautiful the way I remember her.</q></p>

<p><q>Is that the way you always think of her?</q> she asked curiously. <q>The way she looked forty-five years ago?</q></p>

<p>I pulled out another photo, taken the year before Deedee died. She was about forty pounds heavier, and her hair was white, and there were wrinkles around her eyes. I stared at it for a minute, then handed it to Deirdre.</p>

<p><q>This is her, too,</q> I said. <q>I&rsquo;d look at her, and I&rsquo;d see past the pounds and the years. I think every woman is beautiful, each in her own way, and my Deedee was the most beautiful of all.</q></p>

<p><q>It&rsquo;s a shame you&rsquo;re not fifty years younger,</q> she said. <q>I could go for someone who feels that way.</q></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what to say to that, so I said nothing.</p>

<p><q>What did your wife die of?</q> she asked at last.</p>

<p><q>She was walking across the street, and some kid who was high on drugs came racing around the corner doing seventy miles an hour. She never knew what hit her.</q> I paused, remembering that awful day. <q>The kid got six months&rsquo; probation and lost his license. I lost Deedee.</q></p>

<p><q>Did you see it happen?</q></p>

<p><q>No, I was still inside the store, paying for the groceries. I heard it, though. Sounded like a clap of thunder.</q></p>

<p><q>That&rsquo;s terrible.</q></p>

<p><q>At least she didn&rsquo;t feel any pain,</q> I said. <q>I suppose there are worse ways to go. Slower ways, anyway. Most of my friends are busy discovering them.</q></p>

<p>Now it was her turn to be at a loss for an answer. Finally she looked at her watch. <q>I have to go, Walter,</q> she said. <q>It&rsquo;s been &hellip; interesting.</q></p>

<p><q>Perhaps we could meet again?</q> I suggested hopefully.</p>

<p>She gave me a look that said all her worst fears were true after all.</p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m not asking for a date,</q> I continued hastily. <q>I&rsquo;m an old man. I&rsquo;d just like to talk to you again. It&rsquo;d be like being with Deedee again for a few minutes.</q> I paused, half-expecting her to tell me that it was sick, but she didn&rsquo;t say anything. <q>Look, I eat here all the time. What if you came back a week from today, and we just talked during dinner? My treat. I promise not to follow you home, and I&rsquo;m too arthritic to play footsie under the table.</q></p>

<p>She couldn&rsquo;t repress a smile at my last remark. <q>All right, Walter,</q> she said. <q>I&rsquo;ll be your ghost from six to seven.</q></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was as nervous as a schoolboy a week later when six o&rsquo;clock rolled around. I&rsquo;d even worn a jacket and tie for the first time in months. (I&rsquo;d also cut myself in three places while shaving, but I hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t notice.)</p>

<p>Six o&rsquo;clock came and went, and so did six ten. She finally entered the place at a quarter after, in a blouse and slacks I could have sworn belonged to Deedee.</p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m late,</q> she said, sitting down opposite me. <q>I was reading and lost track of the time.</q></p>

<p><q>Let me guess,</q> I said. <q>Jane Austen?</q></p>

<p><q>How did you know?</q> she asked, surprised.</p>

<p><q>She was Deedee&rsquo;s favorite.</q></p>

<p><q>I didn&rsquo;t say she was my favorite,</q> said Deirdre.</p>

<p><q>But she is, isn&rsquo;t she?</q> I persisted.</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable pause.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> she said at last.</p>

<p>We ordered our dinner&mdash;of course she had the eggplant parmesan; it was what Deedee always had&mdash;and then she pulled a couple of magazines out of her bag, one full-sized, one a digest, and showed me some illustrations she had done.</p>

<p><q>Very good,</q> I said. <q>Especially this one of the little blonde girl and the horse. It reminds me&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>Of something your wife did?</q></p>

<p>I nodded. <q>A long time ago. I haven&rsquo;t thought of it for years. I always liked it, but she felt she&rsquo;d done many better ones.</q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;ve done better, too,</q> said Deirdre. <q>But these were handy.</q></p>

<p>We spoke a little more before the meal came. I tried to keep it general, because I could see all these parallels with Deedee were making her uncomfortable. Vincenzo had his walls covered by photos of famous Italians; she knew Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin and Joe DiMaggio, but I spent a few minutes explaining what Carmine Basilio and Eddie Arcaro and some of the others had done to deserve such enshrinement.</p>

<p><q>You know,</q> I said as the salads arrived, <q>Deedee had a beautiful leatherbound set of Jane Austen&rsquo;s works. I never read them, and they&rsquo;re just sitting there gathering dust. I&rsquo;d be happy to give them to you next week.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t,</q> she said. <q>They must be worth a small fortune.</q></p>

<p><q>A very small one,</q> I said. <q>Besides, when I die, they&rsquo;ll just wind up in the garbage, or maybe at Goodwill.</q></p>

<p><q>Don&rsquo;t talk about dying like that,</q> she said.</p>

<p><q>Like what?</q></p>

<p><q>So matter-of-factly.</q></p>

<p><q>The closer you get to it, the more a matter of fact it becomes,</q> I said. <q>Don&rsquo;t worry,</q> I added lightly. <q>I promise not to die before dinner&rsquo;s over. Now, about those Austen books &hellip;</q></p>

<p>I could see her struggling with herself. <q>You&rsquo;re sure?</q> she said at last.</p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m sure. You can have a matched set of the Bront&euml;s too, if you like.</q></p>

<p><q>Thank you, but I don&rsquo;t really like them.</q></p>

<p>It figured. I don&rsquo;t think Deedee had ever cracked any of them open.</p>

<p><q>All right,</q> I said. <q>Just the Austen. I&rsquo;ll bring them next week.</q></p>

<p>Suddenly she frowned. <q>I don&rsquo;t think I can make it next week, Walter,</q> she said. <q>My fianc&eacute;&rsquo;s been away on business, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s the day he comes home.</q></p>

<p><q>Your fianc&eacute;?</q> I repeated. <q>You haven&rsquo;t mentioned him before.</q></p>

<p><q>We&rsquo;ve only spoken twice,</q> she replied. <q>I wasn&rsquo;t hiding the fact.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, good for you,</q> I said. <q>You must know by now that I&rsquo;m a believer in marriage.</q></p>

<p><q>I guess I am, too,</q> she said.</p>

<p><q>You guess?</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I believe in marriage. I just don&rsquo;t know if I believe in marriage with Ron.</q></p>

<p><q>Then why are you engaged to him?</q></p>

<p>She shrugged. <q>I&rsquo;m thirty-one. It was time. And he&rsquo;s nice enough.</q></p>

<p><q>But?</q> I asked. <q>There&rsquo;s a <q>but</q> in there somewhere.</q></p>

<p><q>But I don&rsquo;t know if I want to spend the rest of my life with him.</q> She paused, puzzled. <q>Now why did I tell you that?</q></p>

<p><q>I don&rsquo;t know,</q> I replied. <q>Why do you think you did?</q></p>

<p><q>I don&rsquo;t know either,</q> she said. <q>I just have this feeling that I can confide in you.</q></p>

<p><q>I appreciate that,</q> I said. <q>As for spending the rest of your life with your young man&mdash;hell, the way everyone gets married and divorced these days, maybe you won&rsquo;t have to.</q></p>

<p><q>You sure know how to cheer a girl up, Walter,</q> she said wryly.</p>

<p><q>I apologize. Your private life is none of my business. I meant no offense.</q></p>

<p><q>Fine.</q> Then: <q>What shall we talk about?</q></p>

<p>I thought about Deedee. Sooner or later we talked about everything under the sun, but her greatest passion was the theatre. <q>Whose work do you like better&mdash;Tom Stoppard&rsquo;s or Edward Albee&rsquo;s?</q></p>

<p>Her face lit up, and I could tell she was going to spend the next ten minutes telling me exactly who she preferred, and why.</p>

<p>Somehow I wasn&rsquo;t surprised.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We skipped the following week, but met every week thereafter for the next three months. Ron even came along once, probably to make sure I was as old and unattractive as she&rsquo;d described me. He must have satisfied himself on those counts, because he never came back. He seemed a nice enough young man, and he was clearly in love with her.</p>

<p>I ran into her twice at my local Borders and once at Barnes &amp; Noble, and both times I bought her coffee. I knew I was falling in love with her&mdash;hell, I&rsquo;d been in love with her from the first instant I saw her. But that&rsquo;s where it got confusing, because I knew I wasn&rsquo;t really in love with <i>her</i>; I was in love with the younger version of Deedee that she represented.</p>

<p>Ron had to leave town on another business trip, and while he was gone she took me to the theatre to see a revival of Stoppard&rsquo;s <i>Jumpers</i> and I took her to the racetrack to watch a minor stakes race for fillies. The play was nice enough, a little obscure but well-acted; I don&rsquo;t think she liked the color and excitement of the track any more than Deedee had.</p>

<p>I kept wondering if she could somehow <i>be</i> Deedee reincarnated, but I knew deep in my gut that it wasn&rsquo;t possible: if she was Deedee&mdash;<i>my</i> Deedee&mdash;she&rsquo;d have been put here for me, and this one was marrying a young man named Ron. Besides, she had a past, she had photos of herself as a little girl, friends who had known her for years, and Deedee had only been dead for seven years. And while I didn&rsquo;t understand what was happening, I knew there couldn&rsquo;t have been two of her co-existing at the same time. (No, I never asked myself <i>why</i>; I just knew it couldn&rsquo;t be.)</p>

<p>Sometimes, as a bit of an experiment, I&rsquo;d order a wine, or mention a play or book or movie that I knew Deedee hadn&rsquo;t liked, and invariably Deirdre would wrinkle her nose and express her lack of enthusiasm for the very same thing.</p>

<p>It was uncanny. And in a way it was frightening, because I couldn&rsquo;t understand why it was happening. This wasn&rsquo;t <i>my</i> Deedee. Mine had lived her life with me, and that life was over. I was a seventy-six-year-old man with half a dozen ailments who was just beating time on his way to the grave. I was never going to impose myself on Deirdre, and she was never going to look upon me as anything but an eccentric acquaintance &hellip; so why had I met her?</p>

<p>From time to time I&rsquo;d had this romantic fancy that when two people loved each other and suited each other the way Deedee and I did, they&rsquo;d keep coming back over and over again. Once they&rsquo;d be Adam and Eve, once they&rsquo;d be Lancelot and Guinevere, once they&rsquo;d be Bogart and Bacall. But they&rsquo;d be <i>together</i>. They wouldn&rsquo;t be an old man and a young woman who could never connect. I had half a century&rsquo;s worth of experiences we could never share, I was sure the thought of my touching her would make her skin crawl, and I was long past the point where I could do anything <i>but</i> touch her. So whether she was my Deedee reborn, or just <i>a</i> Deedee, why were the two of us here at this time and in this place?</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>But a few days later I learned that I&rsquo;d better find out pretty damned quick. Something finally showed up in all the tests I&rsquo;d been taking at the hospital. They put me on half a dozen new medications, gave me some powerful pain pills for when I needed them, and told me not to make any long-term plans.</p>

<p>Hell, I wasn&rsquo;t even that unhappy about it. At least I&rsquo;d be with my Deedee again&mdash;the <i>real</i> Deedee, not the charming substitute.</p>

<p>The next night was our regular dinner date. I&rsquo;d decided not to tell her the news; there was no sense distressing her.</p>

<p>It turned out that she was distressed enough as it was. Ron had given her an ultimatum: set a date or break it off. (Things had changed a lot since my day. Most of my contemporaries would have killed to have a gorgeous girlfriend who had no problem sleeping with them but got nervous at the thought of marriage.)</p>

<p><q>So what are you going to do?</q> I asked sympathetically.</p>

<p><q>I don&rsquo;t know,</q> she replied. <q>I&rsquo;m fond of him, I really am. But I just &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know.</q></p>

<p><q>Let him go,</q> I said.</p>

<p>She stared at me questioningly.</p>

<p><q>If you&rsquo;re not certain after all this time,</q> I said, <q>kiss him off.</q></p>

<p>She sighed deeply. <q>He&rsquo;s everything I should want in a husband, Walter. He&rsquo;s thoughtful and considerate, we share a lot of interests, and he&rsquo;s got a fine future as an architect.</q> She smiled ruefully. <q>I even like his mother.</q></p>

<p><q>But?</q> I prompted her.</p>

<p><q>But I don&rsquo;t think I love him.</q> She stared into my eyes. <q>I always thought I&rsquo;d know right away. At least that&rsquo;s the myth I was brought up on as a little girl, and it was reinforced by all the romance novels I read and the movies I saw. How was it for you and your Deedee? Did you ever have any doubts?</q></p>

<p><q>Never a one,</q> I said. <q>Not from the first moment to the last.</q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m thirty-one, Walter,</q> she said unhappily. <q>If I haven&rsquo;t met the right guy yet, what are the odds he&rsquo;s going to show up before I&rsquo;m forty, or sixty? What if I want to have a baby? Do I have it with a man I don&rsquo;t love, or with a guy I love who&rsquo;s living six states away before it&rsquo;s even born?</q> She sighed unhappily. <q>I have two good friends who married the men of their dreams. They&rsquo;re both divorced. My closest friend married a nice guy she wasn&rsquo;t sure she loved. She&rsquo;s been happily married for ten years, and keeps telling me I&rsquo;m crazy if I let Ron get away.</q> She stared across the table at me, a tortured expression on her face. <q>I&rsquo;d give everything I have to be as sure of a man&mdash;<i>any</i> man&mdash;as you were of your Deedee.</q></p>

<p>And <i>that</i> was when I knew why I&rsquo;d met her, and why the medics had given me a few more months atop Planet Earth before I spent the rest of eternity beneath it.</p>

<p>We finished the meal, and for the first time ever, I walked her home. She lived in one of those high-rise apartment buildings, kind of a miniature city in itself. It wasn&rsquo;t fancy enough to have a doorman, but she assured me the security system was state of the art. She kissed me on the cheek while a couple of neighbors who were coming out looked at her as if she were crazy. I waited until she was safely in the elevator, then left and returned home.</p>

<p>When I woke up the next morning I decided it was time to get busy. At least I was going to be in familiar locations where I felt comfortable. I got dressed and went out to the track, spent a few hours in the grandstand near the furlong pole where I always got the best view of the races, and didn&rsquo;t lay a single bet, just hung around. Then, after dinner, I started making the rounds of all my favorite bookstores. I spent the next two afternoons at the zoo and the natural history museum, where I&rsquo;d spent so many happy afternoons with Deedee, and the one after that at the ballpark in the left field bleachers. I had to take a couple of pain pills along the way, but I didn&rsquo;t let it slow me down. I continued my circuit of bookstores and coffee shops in the evenings.</p>

<p>On the sixth night I decided I was getting tired of Italian food&mdash;hell, I was getting tired, period&mdash;and I went to the Olympus, another restaurant I&rsquo;ve been frequenting for years. It doesn&rsquo;t look like much, no Greek statues, not even any belly dancers or bouzouki players, but it serves the best pastitso and dolmades in town.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s where I saw him.</p>

<p>His face didn&rsquo;t jump right out at me the way Deirdre&rsquo;s did, but then I hadn&rsquo;t really looked at it in a long time. He was alone. I waited until he got up to go to the men&rsquo;s room, and then followed him in.</p>

<p><q>Nice night,</q> I said, when we were washing our hands.</p>

<p><q>If you say so,</q> he answered unenthusiastically.</p>

<p><q>The air is clear, the moon is out, there&rsquo;s a lovely breeze, and the possibilities are endless,</q> I said. <q>What could be better?</q></p>

<p><q>Look, fella,</q> he said irritably, <q>I just broke up with my girl and I&rsquo;m in no mood for talk, okay?</q></p>

<p><q>I need to ask you a couple of questions, Wally.</q></p>

<p><q>How&rsquo;d you know my name?</q> he demanded.</p>

<p>I shrugged. <q>You look like a Wally.</q></p>

<p>He cast a quick look at the door. <q>What the hell&rsquo;s going on? You try anything funny, and I&rsquo;ll&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>Not to worry,</q> I said. <q>I&rsquo;m just a used-up old man trying to do one last good deed on the way to the grave.</q> I pulled an ancient photo out of my wallet and held it up. <q>Look at all familiar?</q></p>

<p>He frowned. <q>I don&rsquo;t remember posing for that. Did you take it?</q></p>

<p><q>A friend did. Who&rsquo;s your favorite actor?</q></p>

<p><q>Humphrey Bogart. Why?</q> Of course. Bogie had been my favorite since I was a kid.</p>

<p><q>Just curious. Last question: what do you think of Agatha Christie?</q></p>

<p><q>Why?</q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m curious.</q></p>

<p>He stared at me for a moment, then shrugged. <q>I can&rsquo;t stand her. Murders take place in back alleys, not vicarages.</q> It figured. I&rsquo;d always hated mystery novels where the murder was committed primarily to provide the detective with a corpse.</p>

<p><q>Good answer, Wally.</q></p>

<p><q>What are you smiling about?</q> he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m happy.</q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m glad one of us is.</q></p>

<p><q>Tell you what,</q> I said. <q>Maybe I can cheer you up, too. You know a restaurant called Vincenzo&rsquo;s&mdash;a little Italian place about three blocks east of here?</q></p>

<p><q>Yeah, I stop in there every now and then. Why?</q></p>

<p><q>I want you to be my guest for dinner tomorrow night.</q></p>

<p><q>Still why?</q></p>

<p><q>I&rsquo;m an old man with nothing to spend my money on,</q> I said. <q>Why don&rsquo;t you humor me?</q></p>

<p>He considered it, then shrugged. <q>What the hell. I don&rsquo;t have anyone to eat with anyway.</q></p>

<p><q>Temporarily,</q> I replied.</p>

<p><q>What are you talking about?</q></p>

<p><q>Just show up,</q> I said. Then, as I walked to the door, I turned back to him and smiled. <q>Have I got a girl for you!</q></p>
