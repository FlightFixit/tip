<hr/>

<p>At three and a half, it's logical for adults to wear eyeglasses to keep their eyeballs warm. Cold eyeballs is an adult affliction no different from many other adult afflictions equally as incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Adults talk always too loudly. A sonic boom for a whisper. Little ears hear the movement of air molecules in the quiet night, when listening for something else to happen.</p>

<p>Adults live too fast. What passes for thinking is habit. Press a button. Listen. Press a button. Listen. Open a drawer. One of the big bastards does it without thinking, doesn't really care what's in there, is looking for a special thing, and he closes the drawer and hasn't really seen anything in it. Tiny hands, eyes peering over the rim, sees a strange little world in the drawer. There isn't enough time made to know the contents. Stop the press. Here is a thing that looks like a key. See how big it is. Wow! What sort of wild surface bug goes with it? Enormous! Nobody has ever seen one that big. Where do they keep it?</p>

<p>Now here's something: a thing for which there is no conceivable use at all. It has moving parts but it doesn't do anything. There's no place to plug it in. I'll bet rabbits made it. Chickens make eggs.</p>

<p><q>Get out of that drawer! Let that alone!</q></p>

<p><i>There she is</i>. I knew it. Too good to last. What was I hurting? Ask what that is, they just kiss the problem off. Push the button. Listen. Tell you nonsense. Maybe she'll go away. Now what's this thing? Looks interesting. What do you supposeâ€”</p>

<p><q>Get <i>out</i> of there!</q></p>

<p>Aw, hell! I'll try to reason with her. Maybe get a conversation going.</p>

<p><q>Candy in here.</q></p>

<p><q>There's no candy in there.</q></p>

<p>How can she possibly know that? No candy in there, indeed! My God, look at all the things there are in there. How can she possibly tell there's no candy: she hasn't even looked. It's not even her drawer. It's Poppa's. <q>What's this for?</q></p>

<p><q>It's not candy. Put it down.</q></p>

<p>No luck. Sometimes, though, you can get to them by talking about candy. Most Ktimes, like now, they don't think at all. I'll cry. Start quiet: it may take a long time. First a little blob, blob, waa. Makes you feel bad, but don't get carried away, you burn out too soon. May have to keep it up for a long time, start slow and easy. She'll wait to see how serious I am. It's easy if you don't rush into it. Get going good, the body takes over: close your eyes and listen. Lovely sounds. Like singing. Good voice. Lots of variety, up and down. I could go on like this all day.</p>

<p>At three and a half, you've been here forever, and it all hasn't been good, not by a damn sight.</p>

<p>Everything has always been too big. Heavy, awkward to handle. How tired you get! All the wrong size. They get big and dumb and you can't talk to them about anything important. Who cares how they make babies? But you want to watch, and they won't let you. You lay awake and wait and wait and wait while they whisper, loud as sonic booms, <q>Is he asleep?</q> Close your eyes and wait some more. Maybe they're afraid I'll laugh at them: they must look silly.</p>

<p>Listen, though, you get smart. You just try not to. They have this special book. Sometimes, though, it's not the book: it's like at the drawer, just now. They're not malicious, just dumb, some of the time.</p>

<p>The damned awful things they do in this book conspiracy, though. The time I had with toilet training; they were going to flush me down the toilet. I thought they would. I really believe they would have. I was scared shitless. But something went wrong, lucky for me, and they didn't, after all. I ought to be grateful to them, I guess, I'm still here. I still don't know why they didn't. They were going to.</p>

<p>There were worse things. The tricks they play on me at night. You wouldn't believe them. I once got so I couldn't sleep at all, just waiting in the night. I had to sleep in the daytime. It's better now. I get more sleep. I asked the other kids at playground; we talk. We make just a few words mean a lot. We know more words than we can use right, so what words we have have to work hard for us. Their parents have special books too.</p>

<p>I'm always afraid they'll do something to my penis. I break out in a sweat when I think about that. That's why I'm so damned afraid at night. One of the reasons.</p>

<p>I used to try to make friends with them, before I got so old. I tried to go get in bed with them, once. They'd fixed up this alarm system; or it came with the book or was part of this course the mailman brings, I think. Oh, it went off with all sorts of sounds and lights flashing, and weird feelings. There I was, trapped, exposed alone on the floor, halfway to their bed, and I just peed all over the carpet.</p>

<p><q>Oh, Christ! It's two o'clock in the morning!</q> That's what he said. Here I was, as scared as anything, standing there, blinking my eyes, and he makes a stupid statement like that.</p>

<p><q>Make him feel guilty,</q> she said. <q>That's what the book says.</q></p>

<p><q>You're a filthy shit!</q> he screamed at me.</p>

<p>I guess I am. There must be some reason they want to cut my penis off. I heard them say, once, that all your real education takes place before you're four years old: by then your character is established. I think maybe I'll make it. It's still such a long ways off, so long, so long. But maybe I really will make it, even if I'm a nervous wreck.</p>

<p>So I don't feel so good about myself. It could be worse.</p>

<p>There is a place called India. You see it on the newscasts. I was afraid they'd send me there. I don't know why I thought that, but I did. It kept me awake too. I went hungry one day, wouldn't eat at all, just to see if I could take it. I couldn't. They can't either. They die. Several million are starving to death right now. I don't know exactly how many that is. It's more than ten.</p>

<p>But apparently they never intended to send me to India.</p>

<p>Or China.</p>

<p>Or a place called South America.</p>

<p>And people don't starve to death where I live. Except in the slums, and that's different. Whatever the slums are. So at least I'm spared that. It could be worse.</p>

<p>On the newscasts, you see big machines making big piles of people and pee-peeing on them and burning them up. <q>Why they burn those people, Momma?</q></p>

<p><q>Hush! It's too awful. They just breed like flies and they can't <i>feed</i> themselves.</q></p>

<p>How do flies breed? What she mean by that? But I think they should let me watch: just to be sure they don't breed like flies do, however that is, so they can continue to feed themselves. I would feed them, though, if it really came to that. I wonder about the Indian children, sometimes. Nobody ever mentions them. Maybe there aren't any.</p>

<p>Flies all fits in, somehow, but it's not too clear to me. Last summer there was really this fly thing. Momma said it was because they couldn't burn people fast enough, and there was a world-wide plague, and I remember how scared they were that we couldn't keep it out. The time everybody had killing flies! It was all over the newscasts.</p>

<p>It went on until it got monotonous. In fact, most newscasts aren't very interesting after a while. They keep changing the places, but there's still this big machine pushing up piles of people and setting them on fire. I like the ones on our space program better. We have a colony on Mars.</p>

<p>We have to have.</p>

<p>For some reason.</p>

<p>Most people go out everyday, all the Poppas, and cheer for this program. I've never seen them do it, but I guess it's like a football game. It's called work. They pay him money for it that Momma writes checks on to pay for credit cards with. They must know what they're doing.</p>

<p>I'm coming along in figuring them out. Every once in a while I think I have it.</p>

<p>I think they have a machine somewhere that makes time, or maybe a press that prints it like a book. They never mention this. Maybe I have to learn how they make electricity, first. They say I'm going to start learning about things like that pretty soon.</p>

<p>And you really have to try to figure the big bastards out. Don't ask me why. You do. You can't do anything about them. They're still going to batter you around. Shaping the personality, it's called. But you have to keep trying, keep hoping. Every once in a great while you can get a conversation going with them. Usually about candy, unfortunately. You learn to like candy, though, and I guess that's something. Sometimes I think it's the most important thing in the whole world.</p>

<p>But if they'd just stop and think every once in a while. If they'd just slow down and talk to you, it might be better. But they don't stop to think. They're always rushing. I give an example. I start up some of the electronic equipment in the basement. We got this electronic dirt remover. I put my bedclothes in it. Sheets, blanket, pillow. Don't you think that wasn't a job! Down two windy flights of stairs with them. Dropping them, picking them up, trying not to make any noise. House quiet. Real early. Everybody asleep.</p>

<p>Off she goes! Beautiful!</p>

<p>It don't stop, though. Like it does for Momma. I hear the bedclothes being torn up. Rip, rip-rip, rip. I better go tell them.</p>

<p>I go into their room. They are still asleep. I tiptoe toward Momma. She maybe won't take it as bad as Poppa.</p>

<p>Bam! I walk into this stupid new fly screen they have on and I forgot about. It shakes hell out of me, and I start to cry. Poppa sets up and screams, <q>You filthy shit!</q></p>

<p><q>What time is it?</q> asks Momma.</p>

<p>I don't understand about all this time thing, but I tell her about the bedclothes.</p>

<p><q>My God!</q></p>

<p>Stark naked, both of them, down the stairs. They get in each other's way.</p>

<p>I trail after. It's a lot of work, a little boy going down big stairs, trying to hurry. You have to be careful not to fall.</p>

<p>Poppa got it turned off. <q>That was close. It could have blown up half the house.</q></p>

<p><q>You filthy shit!</q> Momma screams at me.</p>

<p><q>Shut up, Hazel, this is serious. The kid could have killed himself.</q></p>

<p>I got a long lecture, right there, on how dangerous modern devices are. I wanted them to show me how to operate it right, so I wouldn't do it wrong again. But they were too dumb to do that. No, just leave it <i>alone</i>! How can I learn if they won't ever let me do anything? Why did they think I brought the bedclothes down in the first place?</p>

<p>Momma says, <q>First we got to give you a personalityâ€”we got to fix it so you can grow up to be the kind of man you want to be. <i>Then</i>, after that, you start going to school to learn things. When you get to be four years old, you start to school to learn things. You're only three and a half!</q></p>

<p>Do you know how long you're three and a half? You're three and a half forever. There isn't any time at all. Something has gone wrong with their press, and they don't know it.</p>

<p><q>What kind of man I want to be?</q></p>

<p><q>The country needs scientists,</q> Poppa said. <q>We take a course from the government called: How to Make Scientists. How to shape personalities who want to understand how things workâ€”who always have to figure things out, who aren't happy unless they're figuring things out. It's a good personality. Don't go fiddling with this electronic gear any more or you'll get killed.</q></p>

<p>So that's what I'm going to be, a scientist. I don't know what the other choices were, but I guess it's too late anyhow. They might have been worse, at least I like to think that. Like going to India.</p>

<p>We kids at playground, we talk about the big bastards all the time. They used to be like us. Something happened to them that made them forget how to think.</p>

<p>I guess I will too. I get big, like them, I won't remember any of this, either. Lots of things I can't remember, already. There was a time, so long ago I just about can't remember, when Momma and Poppa loved me. That was in the beginning. But I guess maybe that's what it said in the book to do, too. It was nicer, then, but I forget so much. So all this I'll just forget. Because I'm not really me yet. They're still making me.</p>

<p>Right now, I think a lot about those people in India. I don't know why I should. I think it would be sensible to set them down to a table and feed them. I think that would be a good thing to do. But I guess when I get interested in learning how things work I won't think that way any more. And I guess I'll just forget all this.</p>

<p>I'm still standing here, crying, by the open drawer that's filled with this strange world of things. I've finally gotten to her. <q>What do you <i>want</i>?</q></p>

<p>It's too late to find out whether there really is candy in there. It always was. She'd never spend all that time to search through there with me. It's too late to find out what this thing is for which there is no conceivable use. I've been crying so long, I feel hurt by it and I can't stop crying.</p>

<p><q>What do you <i>want</i>?</q></p>

<p>I want to start forgetting. Like what they do to me, sometimes, at night, to shape my personality. You wouldn't believe how bad I want to forget that. And it's such a long time more, such a long, long, long time. I don't know if I can last, sometimes. I've got to hurry up and start forgetting. <q>I want to hurry up and be four years old!</q></p>

<hr/>

<p>Afterword:</p>

<p>In <q>From the Government Printing Office,</q> I have tried to project a future in which the education of children involves striking terror into their hearts in the hopes of producing more creative individuals. Perhaps this is not unlike what we have always done, with our frightening stories of witches and goblins and evil spirits and threats of hell. In my view, children are our most important product and should be better handled, but in any event one need only listen closely to the speech of children to hear the history of the future.</p>
