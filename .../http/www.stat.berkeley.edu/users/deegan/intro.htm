<p>For various reasons having altogether to do with my girlfriend Chloe's study abroad in China,
I've decided to take it upon myself to create a collection of Internet mini-projects in order to
study the Mandarin language--of which I know next to nothing.  Well, except that "Wo yao qin ni de bizi,"
means, "I want to kiss your nose."
<p>I'm sure you've noticed the lack of dazzling, state-of-the-art graphics here.  Inasmuch as I'd like to claim that
the reason is none other than to alleviate Chloe's
download time on those pokey cafe computers in Kunming, the overriding fact is that
I am, in actuality, a pokey HTML programmer.
<p>So I'll figure out how to anchor an image and decipher JavaScript,
and maybe I'll pick up a little Mandarin along the way.</font>
