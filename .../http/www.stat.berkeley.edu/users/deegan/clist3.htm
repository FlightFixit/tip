<p>Choose a category in the table to the left.  A list of characters in that category will
appear in this frame, along with their Pinyin equivalents and their common English
definitions.</p>
<p>Like English words, Chinese characters may have more than one meaning;
moreover, two different Chinese characters may have the same pronunciation.</p>

<p>Some Chinese characters come in two forms:  <i>traditional</i> and <i>simplified</i>.  Traditional characters
predate their simplified equivalents; however, the simplified characters are more often seen today in mainland China than
their traditional counterparts.</p>

<p>I'm currently learning Mandarin from a few <a href="about.htm#list" target="_top">sources</a>, and the characters
found on this page comprise my entire repertoire to date.  The <a href="test1.htm" target="_top">Chinese Character/Pinyin Test</a> I've developed can quiz you on these.</p>

<p>If you're interested, there are sites on the web that explain <a href="links1.htm#pinyin" target="_top">Pinyin</a>.</p>
