<h1>The Big Front Yard</h1>
<h2>Clifford D. Simak</h2>

<hr />

<p>Hiram Taine came awake and sat up in his bed.</p>

<p>Towser was barking and scratching at the floor.</p>

<p><q>Shut up,</q> Taine told the dog.</p>

<p>Towser cocked quizzical ears at him and then resumed the barking and scratching at the floor.</p>

<p>Taine rubbed his eyes. He ran a hand through his rat&#8217;s-nest head of hair. He considered lying down again and pulling up the covers.</p>

<p>But not with Towser barking.</p>

<p><q>What&#8217;s the matter with you, anyhow?</q> he asked Towser, with not a a little wrath.</p>

<p><q><em>Whuff</em>,</q> said Towser, industriously proceeding with his scratching at the floor.</p>

<p><q>If you want out,</q> said Taine, <q>all you got to do is open the screen door. You know how it is done. You do it all the time.</q></p>

<p>Towser quit his barking and sat down heavily, watching his master getting out of bed.</p>

<p>Taine put on his shirt and pulled on his trousers, but didn&#8217;t bother with his shoes.</p>

<p>Towser ambled over to a corner, put his nose down to the baseboard and snuffled moistly.</p>

<p><q>You got a mouse?</q> asked Taine.</p>

<p><q><em>Whuff</em>,</q> said Towser, most emphatically. <em>&lt;</em></p>

<p><q><em>I</em> can&#8217;t ever remember you making such a row about a mouse,</q> Taine said, slightly puzzled. <q>You must be off your rocker.</q></p>

<p>It was a beautiful summer morning. Sunlight was pouring through the open window.</p>

<p>Good day for fishing, Taine told himself, then remembered that there&#8217;d be no fishing, for he had to go out and look up that old four-poster maple bed that he had heard about up Woodman way. More than likely, he thought, they&#8217;d want twice as much as it was worth. It was getting so, he told himself, that a man couldn&#8217;t make an honest dollar. Everyone was getting smart about antiques.</p>

<p>He got up off the bed and headed for the living room.</p>

<p><q>Come on,</q> he said to Towser.</p>

<p>Towser came along, pausing now and then to snuffle into corners and to whuffle at the floor.</p>

<p><q>You got it bad,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s a rat, he thought. The house was getting old.</p>

<p>He opened the screen door and Towser went outside.</p>

<p><q>Leave that woodchuck be today,</q> Taine advised him. <q>It&#8217;s a losing battle. You&#8217;ll never dig him out.</q></p>

<p>Towser went around the corner of the house.</p>

<p>Taine noticed that something had happened to the sign that hung on the post beside the driveway. One of the chains had become unhooked and the sign was dangling.</p>

<p>He padded out across the driveway slab and the grass, still wet with dew, to fix the sign. There was nothing wrong with it&#8212;just the unhooked chain. Might have been the wind, he thought, or some passing urchin. Although probably not an urchin. He got along with kids. They never bothered him, like they did some others in the village. Banker Stevens, for example. They were always pestering Stevens.</p>

<p>He stood back a way to be sure the sign was straight.</p>

<p>It read, in big letters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HANDY MAN</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And under that, in smaller lettering:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I <em>fix anything</em> </p>

</blockquote>

<p>And under that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ANTIQUES FOR SALE</p>
  <p><em>What have you got to trade?</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Maybe, he told himself, he&#8217;d ought to have two signs, one for his fix-it shop and one for antiques and trading. Some day, when he had the time, he thought, he&#8217;d paint a couple of new ones. One for each side of the driveway. It would look neat that way.</p>

<p>He turned around and looked across the road at Turner&#8217;s Woods. It was a pretty sight, he thought. A sizable piece of woods like that right at the edge of town. It was a place for birds and rabbits and wood-chucks and squirrels and it was full of forts built through generations by the boys of Willow Bend.</p>

<p>Some day, of course, some smart operator would buy it up and start a housing development or something equally objectionable and when that happened a big slice of his own boyhood would be cut out of his life.</p>

<p>Towser came around the corner of the house. He was sidling along, sniffing at the lowest row of siding and his ears were cocked with interest.</p>

<p><q>That dog is nuts,</q> said Taine and went inside.</p>

<p>He went into the kitchen, his bare feet slapping on the floor.</p>

<p>He filled the teakettle, set it on the stove and turned the burner on underneath the kettle.</p>

<p>He turned on the radio, forgetting that it was out of kilter.</p>

<p>When it didn&#8217;t make a sound, he remembered and, disgusted, snapped it off. That was the way it went, he thought. He fixed other people&#8217;s stuff, but never got around to fixing any of his own.</p>

<p>He went into the bedroom and put on his shoes. He threw the bed together.</p>

<p>Back in the kitchen the stove had failed to work again. The burner beneath the kettle was still cold.</p>

<p>Taine hauled off and kicked the stove. He lifted the kettle and held his palm above the burner. In a few seconds he could detect some heat.</p>

<p><q>Worked again,</q> he told himself.</p>

<p>Some day, he knew, kicking the stove would fail to work. When that happened, he&#8217;d have to get to work on it. Probably wasn&#8217;t more than a loose connection.</p>

<p>He put the kettle back onto the stove.</p>

<p>There was a clatter out in front and Taine went out to see what was going on.</p>

<p>Beasly, the Horton&#8217;s yardboy-chauffeur-gardener-et cetera was backing a rickety old truck up the driveway. Beside him sat Abbie Horton, the wife of H. Henry Horton, the village&#8217;s most important citizen. In the back of the truck, lashed on with ropes and half-protected by a garish red and purple quilt, stood a mammoth television set. Taine recognized it from of old. It was a good ten years out of date and still, by any standard, it was the most expensive set ever <em>to</em> grace any home in Willow Bend.</p>

<p>Abbie hopped out of the truck. She was an energetic, bustling, bossy woman.</p>

<p><q>Good morning, Hiram,</q> she said. <q>Can you fix this set again?</q></p>

<p><q>Never saw anything that I couldn&#8217;t fix,</q> said Taine, but nevertheless he eyed the set with something like dismay. It was not the first time he had tangled with it and he knew what was ahead.</p>

<p><q>It might cost you more than it&#8217;s worth,</q> he warned her. <q>What you really need is a new one. This set is getting old and&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>That&#8217;s just what Henry said,</q> Abbie told him, tartly. <q>Henry wants to get one of the color sets. But I won&#8217;t part with this one. It&#8217;s not just TV, you know. It&#8217;s a combination with radio and a record player and the wood and style are just right for the other furniture, and besides&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I know,</q> said Taine, who&#8217;d heard it all before.</p>

<p>Poor old Henry, he thought. What a life the man must lead. Up at that computer plant all day long, shooting off his face and bossing everyone, then coming home to a life of petty tyranny.</p>

<p><q>Beasly,</q> said Abbie, in her best drill-sergeant voice, <q>you get right up there and get that thing untied.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes&#8217;m,</q> Beasly said. He was a gangling, loose-jointed man who didn&#8217;t look too bright.</p>

<p><q>And see you be careful with it. I don&#8217;t want it all scratched up.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes&#8217;m</q> said Beasly.</p>

<p><q>I&#8217;ll help,</q> Taine offered.</p>

<p>The two climbed into the truck and began unlashing the old monstrosity.</p>

<p><q>It&#8217;s heavy,</q> Abbie warned. <q>You two be careful of it.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes&#8217;m,</q> said Beasly.</p>

<p>It was heavy and it was an awkward thing to boot, but Beasly and Taine horsed it around to the back of the house and up the stoop and through the back door and down the basement stairs, with Abbie following eagle-eyed behind them, alert to the slightest scratch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The basement was Taine&#8217;s combination workshop and display room for antiques. One end of it was filled with benches and with tools and machinery and boxes full of odds and ends and piles of just plain junk were scattered everywhere. The other end housed a collection of rickety chairs, sagging bedposts, ancient highboys, equally ancient lowboys, old coal scuttles painted gold, heavy iron fireplace screens and a lot of other stuff that he had collected from far and wide for as little as he could possibly pay for it.</p>

<p>He and Beasly set the TV down carefully on the floor. Abbie watched them narrowly from the stairs.</p>

<p><q>Why, Hiram,</q> she said, excited, <q>you put a ceiling in the basement. It looks a whole lot better.</q></p>

<p><q>Huh?</q> asked Taine.</p>

<p><q>The ceiling. I said you put in a ceiling.</q></p>

<p>Taine jerked his head up and what she said was true. There was a ceiling there, but he&#8217;d never put it in.</p>

<p>He gulped a little and lowered his head, then jerked it quickly up and had another look. The ceiling was still there.</p>

<p><q>It&#8217;s not that block stuff,</q> said Abbie with open admiration. <q>You can&#8217;t see any joints at all. How did you manage it?</q></p>

<p>Taine gulped again and got back his voice. <q>Something I thought up,</q> he told her weakly.</p>

<p><q>You&#8217;ll have to come over and do it to our basement. Our basement is a sight. Beasly put the ceiling in the amusement room, but Beasly is all thumbs.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes&#8217;m,</q> Beasly said contritely.</p>

<p><q>When I get the time,</q> Taine promised, ready to promise anything to get them out of there.</p>

<p><q>You&#8217;d have a lot more time,</q> Abbie told him acidly, <q>if you weren&#8217;t gadding around all over the country buying up that broken-down old furniture that you call antiques. Maybe you can fool the city folks when they come driving out here, but you can&#8217;t fool me.</q></p>

<p><q>I make a lot of money out of some of it,</q> Taine told her calmly.</p>

<p><q>And lose your shirt on the rest of it,</q> she said.</p>

<p><q>I got some old china that is just the kind of stuff you are looking for,</q> said Taine. <q>Picked it up just a day or two ago. Made a good buy on it. I can let you have it cheap.</q></p>

<p><q>I&#8217;m not interested,</q> she said and clamped her mouth tight shut.</p>

<p>She turned around and went back up the stairs.</p>

<p><q>She&#8217;s on the prod today,</q> Beasly said to Taine. <q>It will be a bad day. It always is when she starts early in the morning.</q></p>

<p><q>Don&#8217;t pay attention to her,</q> Taine advised.</p>

<p><q>I try not to, but it ain&#8217;t possible. You sure you don&#8217;t need a man? I&#8217;d work for you cheap.</q></p>

<p><q>Sorry, Beasly. Tell you what&#8212;come over some night soon and we&#8217;ll play some checkers.</q></p>

<p><q>I&#8217;ll do that, Hiram. You&#8217;re the only one who ever asks me over. All the others ever do is laugh at me or shout.</q></p>

<p>Abbie&#8217;s voice came bellowing down the stairs. <q>Beasly, are you coming? Don&#8217;t go standing there all day. I have rugs to beat.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes&#8217;m,</q> said Beasly, starting up the stairs.</p>

<p>At the truck, Abbie turned on Taine with determination: <q>You&#8217;ll get that set fixed right away? I&#8217;m lost without it.</q></p>

<p><q>Immediately,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p>He stood and watched them off, then looked around for Towser, but the dog had disappeared. More than likely he was at the woodchuck hole again, in the woods across the road. Gone off, thought Taine, without his breakfast, too.</p>

<p>The teakettle was boiling furiously when Taine got back to the kitchen. He put coffee in the maker and poured in the water. Then he went downstairs.</p>

<p>The ceiling was still there.</p>

<p>He turned on all the lights and walked around the basement, staring up at it.</p>

<p>It was a dazzling white material and it appeared to be translucent&#8212; up to a point, that is. One could see into it, but he could not see through it. And there were no signs of seams. It was fitted neatly and tightly around the water pipes and the ceiling lights.</p>

<p>Taine stood on a chair and rapped his knuckles against it sharply. It gave out a bell-like sound, almost exactly as if he&#8217;d rapped a fingernail against a thinly-blown goblet.</p>

<p>He got down off the chair and stood there, shaking his head. The whole thing was beyond him. He had spent part of the evening repairing Banker Stevens&#8217; lawn mower and there&#8217;d been no ceiling then.</p>

<p>He rummaged in a box and found a drill. He dug out one of the smaller bits and fitted it in the drill. He plugged in the cord and climbed on the chair again and tried the bit against the ceiling. The whirling steel slid wildly back and forth. It didn&#8217;t make a scratch. He switched off the drill and looked closely at the ceiling. There was not a mark upon it. He tried again, pressing against the drill with all his strength. The bit went <em>ping</em> and the broken end flew across the basement and hit the wall.</p>

<p>Taine stepped down off the chair. He found another bit and fitted it in the drill and went slowly up the stairs, trying to think. But he was too confused to think. That ceiling should not be up there, but there it was. And unless he went stark, staring crazy and forgetful as well, he had not put it there.</p>

<p>In the living room, he folded back one corner of the worn and faded carpeting and plugged in the drill. He knelt and started drilling in the floor. The bit went smoothly through the old oak flooring, then stopped. He put on more pressure and the drill spun without getting any bite.</p>

<p>And there wasn&#8217;t supposed to be anything underneath that wood! Nothing to stop a drill. Once through the flooring, it should have dropped into the space between the joists.</p>

<p>Taine disengaged the drill and laid it to one side.</p>

<p>He went into the kitchen and the coffee now was ready. But before he poured it, he pawed through a cabinet drawer and found a pencil flashlight. Back in the living room he shone the light into the hole that the drill had made.</p>

<p>There was something shiny at the bottom of the hole.</p>

<p>He went back to the kitchen and found some day-old doughnuts and poured a cup of coffee. He sat at the kitchen table, eating doughnuts and wondering what to do.</p>

<p>There didn&#8217;t appear, for the moment at least, much that he could do. He could putter around all day trying to figure out what had happened to his basement and probably not be any wiser than he was right now.</p>

<p>His money-making Yankee soul rebelled against such a horrid waste of time.</p>

<p>There was, he told himself, that maple four-poster that he should be getting to before some unprincipled city antique dealer should run afoul of it. A piece like that, he figured, if a man had any luck at all, should sell at a right good price. He might turn a handsome profit on it if he only worked it right.</p>

<p>Maybe, he thought, he could turn a trade on it. There was the table model TV set that he had traded a pair of ice skates for last winter. Those folks out Woodman way might conceivably be happy to trade the bed for a reconditioned TV set, almost like brand new. After all, they probably weren&#8217;t using the bed and, he hoped fervently, had no idea of the value of it.</p>

<p>He ate the doughnuts hurriedly and gulped down an extra cup of coffee. He fixed a plate of scraps for Towser and set it outside the door. Then he went down into the basement and got the table TV set and put it in the pickup truck. As an afterthought, he added a reconditioned shotgun which would be perfectly all right if a man were careful not to use these far-reaching, powerful shells, and a few other odds and ends that might come in handy on a trade.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He got back late, for it had been a busy and quite satisfactory day. Not only did he have the four-poster loaded on the truck, but he had as well a rocking chair, a fire screen, a bundle of ancient magazines, an old-fashioned barrel churn, a walnut highboy and a Governor Winthrop on which some half-baked, slap-happy decorator had applied a coat of apple-green paint. The television set, the shotgun and five dollars had gone into the trade. And what was better yet, he&#8217;d managed it so well that the Woodman family probably was dying of laughter at this very moment about how they&#8217;d taken him.</p>

<p>He felt a little ashamed of it&#8212;they&#8217;d been such friendly people. They had treated him so kindly and had him stay for dinner and had sat and talked with him and shown him about the farm and even asked him to stop by if he went through that way again.</p>

<p>He&#8217;d wasted the entire day, he thought, and he rather hated that, but maybe it had been worth it to build up his reputation out that way as the sort of character who had softening of the head and didn&#8217;t know the value of a dollar. That way, maybe some other day, he could do some more business in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>He heard the television set as he opened the back door, sounding loud and clear, and he went clattering down the basement stairs in something close to a panic. For now that he&#8217;d traded off the table model, Abbie&#8217;s set was the only one downstairs and Abbie&#8217;s set was broken.</p>

<p>It was Abbie&#8217;s set, all right. It stood just where he and Beasly had put it down that morning and there was nothing wrong with it&#8212;nothing wrong at all. It was even televising color.</p>

<p><em>Televising color!</em></p>

<p>He stopped at the bottom of the stairs and leaned against the railing for support.</p>

<p>The set kept right on televising color.</p>

<p>Taine stalked the set and walked around behind it.</p>

<p>The back of the cabinet was off, leaning against a bench that stood behind the set, and he could see the innards of it glowing cheerily.</p>

<p>He squatted on the basement floor and squinted at the lighted innards and they seemed a good deal different from the way that they should be. He&#8217;d repaired the set many times before and he thought he had a good idea of what the working parts would look like. And now they all seemed different, although just how he couldn&#8217;t tell.</p>

<p>A heavy step sounded on the stairs and a hearty voice came booming down to him.</p>

<p><q>Well, Hiram, I see you got it fixed.</q></p>

<p>Taine jackknifed upright and stood there slightly frozen and completely speechless.</p>

<p>Henry Horton stood foursquarely and happily on the stairs, looking very pleased.</p>

<p><q>I told Abbie that you wouldn&#8217;t have it done, but she said for me to come over anyway&#8212; Hey, Hiram, it&#8217;s in color! How did you do it, man?</q></p>

<p>Taine grinned sickly. <q>I just got fiddling around,</q> he said.</p>

<p>Henry came down the rest of the stairs with a stately step and stood before the set, with his hands behind his back, staring at it fixedly in his best executive manner.</p>

<p>He slowly shook his head. <q>I never would have thought,</q> he said, <q>that it was possible.</q></p>

<p><q>Abbie mentioned that you wanted color.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, sure. Of course I did. But not on this old set I never would have expected to get color on this set. How did you do it, Hiram?</q></p>

<p>Taine told the solemn truth. <q>I can&#8217;t rightly say,</q> he said.</p>

<p>Henry found a nail keg standing in front of one of the benches and rolled it out in front of the old-fashioned set. He sat down warily and relaxed into solid comfort.</p>

<p><q>That&#8217;s the way it goes,</q> he said. <q>There are men like you, but not very many of them. Just Yankee tinkerers. You keep messing around with things, trying one thing here and another there and before you know it you come up with something.</q></p>

<p>He sat on the nail keg, staring at the set.</p>

<p><q>It&#8217;s sure a pretty thing,</q> he said. <q>It&#8217;s better than the color they have in Minneapolis. I dropped in at a couple of the places the last time I was there and looked at the color sets. And I tell you honest, Hiram, there wasn&#8217;t one of them that was as good as this.</q></p>

<p>Taine wiped his brow with his shirt sleeve. Somehow or other, the basement seemed to be getting warm. He was fine sweat all over.</p>

<p>Henry found a big cigar in one of his pockets and held it out to Taine.</p>

<p><q>No, thanks. I never smoke.</q></p>

<p><q>Perhaps you&#8217;re wise,</q> said Henry. <q>It&#8217;s a nasty habit.</q></p>

<p>He stuck the cigar into his mouth and rolled it east to west.</p>

<p><q>Each man to his own,</q> he proclaimed expansively. <q>When it comes to a thing like this, you&#8217;re the man to do it. You seem to think in mechanical contraptions and electronic circuits. Me, I don&#8217;t know a thing about it. Even in the computer game, I still don&#8217;t know a thing about it; I hire men who do. I can&#8217;t even saw a board or drive a nail. But I can organize. You remember, Hiram, how everybody snickered when I started up the plant?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, I guess some of them did, at that.</q></p>

<p><q>You&#8217;re darn tooting they did. They went around for weeks with their hands up to their faces to hide smart-aleck grins. They said, what does Henry think he&#8217;s doing, starting up a computer factory out here in the sticks; he doesn&#8217;t think he can compete with those big companies in the east, does he? And they didn&#8217;t stop their grinning until I sold a couple of dozen units and had orders for a year or two ahead.</q></p>

<p>He fished a lighter from his pocket and lit the cigar carefully, never taking his eyes off the television set.</p>

<p><q>You got something there,</q> he said, judiciously, <q>that may be worth a mint of money. Some simple adaptation that will fit on any set. If you can get color on this old wreck, you can get color on any set that&#8217;s made.</q></p>

<p>He chuckled moistly around the mouthful of cigar. <q>If RCA knew what was happening here this minute, they&#8217;d go out and cut their throats.</q></p>

<p><q>But I don&#8217;t know what I did,</q> protested Taine.</p>

<p><q>Well, that&#8217;s all right,</q> said Henry, happily. <q>I'll take this set up to the plant tomorrow and turn loose some of the boys on it. They&#8217;ll find out what you have here before they&#8217;re through with it.</q></p>

<p>He took the cigar out of his mouth and studied it intently, then popped it back in again.</p>

<p><q>As I was saying, Hiram, that&#8217;s the difference in us. You can do the stuff, but you miss the possibilities. I can&#8217;t do a thing, but I can organize it once the thing is done. Before we get through with this, you&#8217;ll be wading in twenty dollar bills clear up to your knees.</q></p>

<p><q>But I don&#8217;t have-</q></p>

<p><q>Don&#8217;t worry. Just leave it all to me. I&#8217;ve got the plant and whatever money we may need. We&#8217;ll figure out a split.</q></p>

<p><q>That&#8217;s fine of you,</q> said Taine mechanically.</p>

<p><q>Not at all,</q> Henry insisted, grandly. <q>It&#8217;s just my aggressive, grasping sense of profit. I should be ashamed of myself, cutting in on this.</q></p>

<p>He sat on the keg, smoking and watching the TV perform in exquisite color.</p>

<p><q>You know, Hiram,</q> he said, <q>I&#8217;ve often thought of this, but never got around to doing anything about it. I&#8217;ve got an old computer up at the plant that we will have to junk because it&#8217;s taking up room that we really need. It&#8217;s one of our early models, a sort of experimental job that went completely sour. It sure is a screwy thing. No one&#8217;s ever been able to make much out of it. We tried some approaches that probably were wrong&#8212;or maybe they were right, but we didn&#8217;t know enough to make them quite come off. It&#8217;s been standing in a corner all these years and I should have junked it long ago. But I sort of hate to do it. I wonder if you might not like it&#8212;just to tinker with.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, I don&#8217;t know,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p>Henry assumed an expansive air. <q>No obligation, mind you. You may not be able to do a thing with it&#8212;I&#8217;d frankly be surprised if you could, but there&#8217;s no harm in trying. Maybe you&#8217;ll decide to tear it down for the salvage you can get. There are several thousand dollars worth of equipment in it. Probably you could use most of it one way or another.</q></p>

<p><q>It might be interesting,</q> conceded Taine, but not too enthusiastically.</p>

<p><q>Good,</q> said Henry, with an enthusiasm that made up for Taine&#8217;s lack of it. <q>I&#8217;ll have the boys cart it over tomorrow. It&#8217;s a heavy thing. I&#8217;ll send along plenty of help to get it unloaded and down into the basement and set up.</q></p>

<p>Henry stood up carefully and brushed cigar ashes off his lap.</p>

<p><q>I&#8217;ll have the boys pick up the TV set at the same time,</q> he said. <q>I&#8217;ll have to tell Abbie you haven&#8217;t got it fixed yet. If I ever let it get into the house, the way it&#8217;s working now, she&#8217;d hold onto it.</q></p>

<p>Henry climbed the stairs heavily and Taine saw him out the door into the summer night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taine stood in the shadow, watching Henry&#8217;s shadowed figure go across the Widow Taylor&#8217;s yard to the next street behind his house. He took a deep breath of the fresh night air and shook his head to try to clear his buzzing brain, but the buzzing went right on.</p>

<p>Too much had happened, he told himself. Too much for any single day&#8212;first the ceiling and now the TV set. Once he had a good night&#8217;s sleep he might be in some sort of shape to try to wrestle with it.</p>

<p>Towser came around the corner of the house and limped slowly up the steps to stand beside his master. He was mud up to his ears.</p>

<p><q>You had a day of it, I see,</q> said Taine, <q>And, just like I told you, you didn&#8217;t get the woodchuck.</q></p>

<p><q><em>Woof</em>,</q> said Towser, sadly.</p>

<p><q>You&#8217;re just like a lot of the rest of us,</q> Taine told him, severely. <q>Like me and Henry Horton and all the rest of us. You&#8217;re chasing something and you think you know what you&#8217;re chasing, but you really don&#8217;t. And what&#8217;s even worse, you have no faint idea of why you&#8217;re chasing it.</q></p>

<p>Towser thumped a tired tail upon the stoop.</p>

<p>Taine opened the door and stood to one side to let Towser in, then went in himself.</p>

<p>He went through the refrigerator and found part of a roast, a slice or two of luncheon meat, a dried-out slab of cheese and half a bowl of cooked spaghetti. He made a pot of coffee and shared the food with Towser.</p>

<p>Then Taine went back downstairs and shut off the television set. He found a trouble lamp and plugged it in and poked the light into the innards of the set.</p>

<p>He squatted on the floor, holding the lamp, trying to puzzle out what had been done to the set. It was different, of course, but it was a little hard to figure out in just what ways it was different. Someone had tinkered with the tubes and had them twisted out of shape and there were little white cubes of metal tucked here and there in what seemed to be an entirely haphazard and illogical manner&#8212;although, Taine admitted to himself, there probably was no haphazardness. And the circuit, he saw, had been rewired and a good deal of wiring had been added.</p>

<p>But the most puzzling thing about it was that the whole thing seemed to be just jury-rigged&#8212;as if someone had done no more than a hurried, patch-up job to get the set back in working order on an emergency and temporary basis.</p>

<p>Someone, he thought!</p>

<p>And who had that someone been?</p>

<p>He hunched around and peered into the dark corners of the basement and he felt innumerable and many-legged imaginary insects running on his body.</p>

<p>Someone had taken the back off the cabinet and leaned it against the bench and had left the screws which held the back laid neatly in a row upon the floor. Then they had jury-rigged the set and jury-rigged it far better than it had ever been before.</p>

<p>If this was a jury-job, he wondered, just what kind of job would it have been if they had had the time to do it up in style?</p>

<p>They hadn&#8217;t had the time, of course. Maybe they had been scared off when he had come home&#8212;scared off even before they could get the back on the set again.</p>

<p>He stood up and moved stiffly away.</p>

<p>First the ceiling in the morning&#8212;and now, in the evening, Abbie&#8217;s television set.</p>

<p>And the ceiling, come to think of it, was not a ceiling only. Another liner, if that was the proper term for it, of the same material as the ceiling, had been laid beneath the floor, forming a sort of boxed-in area between the joists. He had struck that liner when he had tried to drill into the floor.</p>

<p>And what, he asked himself, if all the house were like that, too?</p>

<p>There was just one answer to it all: <em>There was something in the house with him</em>!</p>

<p>Towser had heard that <em>something</em> or smelled it or in some other manner sensed it and had dug frantically at the floor in an attempt to dig it out, as if it were a woodchuck.</p>

<p>Except that this, whatever it might be, certainly was no woodchuck.</p>

<p>He put away the trouble light and went upstairs.</p>

<p>Towser was curled up on a rug in the living room beside the easy chair and beat his tail in polite decorum in greeting to his master.</p>

<p>Taine stood and stared down at the dog. Towser looked back at him with satisfied and sleepy eyes, then heaved a doggish sigh and settled down to sleep.</p>

<p>Whatever Towser might have heard or smelled or sensed this morning, it was quite evident that as of this moment he was aware of it no longer.</p>

<p>Then Taine remembered something else.</p>

<p>He had filled the kettle to make water for the coffee and had set it on the stove. He had turned on the burner and it had worked the first time.</p>

<p>He hadn&#8217;t had to kick the stove to get the burner going.</p>

<p>He woke in the morning and someone was holding down his feet and he sat up quickly to see what was going on.</p>

<p>But there was nothing to be alarmed about; it was only Towser who had crawled into bed with him and now lay sprawled across his feet.</p>

<p>Towser whined softly and his back legs twitched as he chased dream rabbits.</p>

<p>Taine eased his feet from beneath the dog and sat up, reaching for his clothes. It was early, but he remembered suddenly that he had left all of the furniture he had picked up the day before out there in the truck and should be getting downstairs where he could start reconditioning it.</p>

<p>Towser went on sleeping.</p>

<p>Taine stumbled to the kitchen and looked out of the window and there, squatted on the back stoop, was Beasly, the Horton man-of-all-work.</p>

<p>Taine went to the back door to see what was going on.</p>

<p><q>I quit them, Hiram,</q> Beasly told him. <q>She kept on pecking at me every minute of the day and I couldn&#8217;t do a thing to please her, so I up and quit.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, come on in,</q> said Taine. <q>I suppose you&#8217;d like a bite to eat and a cup of coffee.</q></p>

<p><q>I was kind of wondering if I could stay here, Hiram. Just for my keep until I can find something else.</q></p>

<p><q>Let&#8217;s have breakfast first,</q> said Taine, <q>then we can talk about it.</q></p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t like it, he told himself. He didn&#8217;t like it at all. In another hour or so Abbie would show up and start stirring up a ruckus about how he&#8217;d lured Beasly off. Because, no matter how dumb Beasly might be, he did a lot of work and took a lot of nagging and there wasn&#8217;t anyone else in town who would work for Abbie Horton.</p>

<p><q>Your ma used to give me cookies all the time,</q> said Beasly. <q>Your ma was a real good woman, Hiram.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, she was,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p><q>My ma used to say that you folks were quality, not like the rest in town, no matter what kind of airs they were always putting on. She said your family was among the first settlers. Is that really true, Hiram?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, not exactly first settlers, I guess, but this house has stood here for almost a hundred years. My father used to say there never was a night during all those years that there wasn&#8217;t at least one Taine beneath its roof. Things like that, it seems, meant a lot to father.</q></p>

<p><q>It must be nice,</q> said Beasly, wistfully, <q>to have a feeling like that. You must be proud of this house, Hiram.</q></p>

<p><q>Not really proud; more like belonging. I can&#8217;t imagine living in any other house.</q></p>

<p>Taine turned on the burner and filled the kettle. Carrying the kettle back, he kicked the stove. But there wasn&#8217;t any need to kick it; the burner was already beginning to take on a rosy glow.</p>

<p>Twice in a row, Taine thought. This thing is getting better!</p>

<p><q>Gee, Hiram,</q> said Beasly, <q>this is a dandy radio.</q></p>

<p><q>It&#8217;s no good,</q> said Taine. <q>It&#8217;s broke. Haven&#8217;t had the time to fix it.</q></p>

<p><q>I don&#8217;t think so, Hiram. I just turned it on. It&#8217;s beginning to warm up.</q></p>

<p><q>It&#8217;s beginning to&#8212; Hey, let me see!</q> yelled Taine. Beasly told the truth. A faint hum was coming from the tubes.</p>

<p>A voice came in, gaining in volume as the set warmed up. It was speaking gibberish.</p>

<p><q>What kind of talk is that?</q> asked Beasly.</p>

<p><q>I don&#8217;t know,</q> said Taine, close to panic now.</p>

<p>First the television set, then the stove and now the radio!</p>

<p>He spun the tuning knob and the pointer crawled slowly across the dial face instead of spinning across as he remembered it, and station after station sputtered and went past.</p>

<p>He tuned in the next station that came up and it was strange lingo, too&#8212;and he knew by then exactly what he had.</p>

<p>Instead of a $39.50 job, he had here on the kitchen table an all-band receiver like they advertised in the fancy magazines.</p>

<p>He straightened up and said to Beasly: <q>See if you can get someone speaking English. I&#8217;ll get on with the eggs.</q></p>

<p>He turned on the second burner and got out the frying pan. He put it on the stove and found eggs and bacon in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Beasly got a station that had band music playing.</p>

<p><q>How&#8217;s that?</q> he asked.</p>

<p><q>That&#8217;s fine,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p>Towser came out from the bedroom, stretching and yawning. He went to the door and showed he wanted out.</p>

<p>Taine let him out.</p>

<p><q>If I were you,</q> he told the dog, <q>I&#8217;d lay off that woodchuck. <strong>You&#8217;ll</strong> have all the woods dug up.</q></p>

<p><q>He ain&#8217;t digging after any woodchuck, Hiram.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, a rabbit, then.</q></p>

<p><q>Not a rabbit, either. I snuck off yesterday when I was supposed to be beating rugs. That&#8217;s what Abbie got so sore about.</q></p>

<p>Taine granted, breaking eggs into the skillet.</p>

<p><q>I snuck away and went over to where Towser was. I talked with him and he told me it wasn&#8217;t a woodchuck or a rabbit. He said it was something else. I pitched in and helped him dig. Looks to me like he found an old tank of some sort buried out there in the woods.</q></p>

<p><q>Towser wouldn&#8217;t dig up any tank,</q> protested Taine. <q>He wouldn&#8217;t care about anything except a rabbit or a woodchuck.</q></p>

<p><q>He was working hard,</q> insisted Beasly. <q>He seemed to be excited.</q></p>

<p><q>Maybe the woodchuck just dug his hole under this old tank or whatever it might be.</q></p>

<p><q>Maybe so,</q> Beasly agreed. He fiddled with the radio some more. He got a disk jockey who was pretty terrible.</p>

<p>Taine shoveled eggs and bacon onto plates and brought them to the table. He poured big cups of coffee and began buttering the toast.</p>

<p><q>Dive in,</q> he said to Beasly.</p>

<p><q>This is good of you, Hiram, to take me in like this. I won&#8217;t stay no longer than it takes to find a job.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, I didn&#8217;t exactly say-</q></p>

<p><q>There are times,</q> said Beasly, <q>when I get to thinking I haven&#8217;t got a friend and then I remember your ma, how nice she was to me and all-</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, all right,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p>He knew when he was licked.</p>

<p>He brought the toast and a jar of jam to the table and sat down, beginning to eat.</p>

<p><q>Maybe you got something I could help you with,</q> suggested Beasly, using the back of his hand to wipe egg off his chin.</p>

<p><q>I have a load of furniture out in the driveway. I could use a man to help me get it down into the basement.</q></p>

<p><q>I&#8217;ll be glad to do that,</q> said Beasly. <q>I am good and strong. I don&#8217;t mind work at all. I just don&#8217;t like people jawing at me.</q></p>

<p>They finished breakfast and then carried the furniture down into the basement. They had some trouble with the Governor Winthrop, for it was an unwieldy thing <em>to</em> handle.</p>

<p>When they finally horsed it down, Taine stood off and looked at it. The man, he told himself, who slapped paint onto that beautiful cherry-wood had a lot to answer for.</p>

<p>He said to Beasly: <q>We have to get the paint off that thing there. And we must do it carefully. Use paint remover and a rag wrapped around a spatula and just sort of roll it off. Would you like to try it?</q></p>

<p><q>Sure, I would. Say, Hiram, what will we have for lunch?</q></p>

<p><q>I don&#8217;t know,</q> said Taine. <q>We&#8217;ll throw something together. Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;re hungry.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, it was sort of hard work, getting all that stuff down here.</q></p>

<p><q>There are cookies in the jar on the kitchen shelf,</q> said Taine. <q>Go and help yourself.</q></p>

<p>When Beasly went upstairs, Taine walked slowly around the basement. The ceiling, he saw, was still intact. Nothing else seemed to be disturbed.</p>

<p>Maybe that television set and the stove and radio, he thought, was just their way of paying rent to me. And if that were the case, he told himself, whoever they might be, he&#8217;d be more than willing to let them stay right on.</p>

<p>He looked around some more and could find nothing wrong.</p>

<p>He went upstairs and called to Beasly in the kitchen.</p>

<p><q>Come on out to the garage, where I keep the paint. We&#8217;ll hunt up some remover and show you how to use it.</q></p>

<p>Beasly, a supply of cookies clutched in his hand, trotted willingly behind him.</p>

<p>As they rounded the corner of the house they could hear Towser&#8217;s muffled barking. Listening to him, it seemed to Taine that he was getting hoarse.</p>

<p>Three days, he thought&#8212;or was it four?</p>

<p><q>If we don&#8217;t do something about it,</q> he said, <q>that fool dog is going to get himself wore out.</q></p>

<p>He went into the garage and came back with two shovels and a pick.</p>

<p><q>Come on,</q> he said to Beasly. <q>We have to put a stop to this before we have any peace.</q></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Towser had done himself a noble job of excavation. He was almost completely out of sight. Only the end of his considerably bedraggled tail showed out of the hole he had clawed in the forest floor.</p>

<p>Beasly had been right about the tanklike thing. One edge of it showed out of one side of the hole.</p>

<p>Towser backed out of the hole and sat down heavily, his whiskers dripping clay, his tongue hanging out of the side of his month.</p>

<p><q>He says that it&#8217;s about time that we showed up,</q> said Beasly.</p>

<p>Taine walked around the hole and knelt down. He reached down a hand to brush the dirt off the projecting edge of Beasly&#8217;s tank. The clay was stubborn and hard to wipe away, but from the feel of it the tank was heavy metal.</p>

<p>Taine picked up a shovel and rapped it against the tank. The tank gave out a clang.</p>

<p>They got to work, shoveling away a foot or so of topsoil that lay above the object. It was hard work and the thing was bigger than they had thought and it took some time to get it uncovered, even roughly.</p>

<p><q>I&#8217;m hungry,</q> Beasly complained.</p>

<p>Taine glanced at his watch. It was almost one o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p><q>Run on back to the house,</q> he said to Beasly. <q>You&#8217;ll find something in the refrigerator and there&#8217;s milk to drink.</q></p>

<p><q>How about you, Hiram? Ain&#8217;t you ever hungry?</q></p>

<p><q>You could bring me back a sandwich and see if you can find a trowel.</q></p>

<p><q>What you want a trowel for?</q></p>

<p><q>I want to scrape the dirt off this thing and see what it is.</q></p>

<p>He squatted down beside the thing they had unearthed and watched Beasly disappear into the woods.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><q>Towser,</q> he said, <q>this is the strangest animal you ever put to ground.</q></p>

<p>A man, he told himself, might better joke about it&#8212;if to do no more than keep his fear away.</p>

<p>Beasly wasn&#8217;t scared, of course. Beasly didn&#8217;t have the sense to be scared of a thing like this.</p>

<p>Twelve feet wide by twenty long and oval shaped. About the size, he thought, of a good-size living room. And there never had been a tank of that shape or size in all of Willow Bend.</p>

<p>He fished his jackknife out of his pocket and started to scratch away the dirt at one point on the surface of the thing. He got a square inch of free dirt and it was no metal such as he had ever seen. It looked for all the world like glass.</p>

<p>He kept on scraping at the dirt until he had a clean place as big as an outstretched hand.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t any metal. He&#8217;d almost swear to that. It looked like cloudy glass&#8212;like the milk-glass goblets and bowls he was always on the look-out for. There were a lot of people who were plain nuts about it and they&#8217;d pay fancy prices for it.</p>

<p>He closed the knife and put it back into his pocket and squatted, looking at the oval shape that Towser had discovered.</p>

<p>And the conviction grew: Whatever it was that had come to live with him undoubtedly had arrived in the same contraption. From space or time, he thought, and was astonished that he thought it, for he&#8217;d never thought such a thing before.</p>

<p>He picked up his shovel and began to dig again, digging down this time, following the curving side of this alien thing that lay within the earth.</p>

<p>And as he dug, he wondered. What should he say about this&#8212;or should he say anything? Maybe the smartest course would be to cover it again and never breathe a word about it to a living soul.</p>

<p>Beasly would talk about it, naturally. But no one in the village would pay attention to anything that Beasly said. Everyone in Willow Bend knew Beasly was cracked.</p>

<p>Beasly finally came back. He carried three inexpertly-made sandwiches wrapped in an old newspaper and a quart bottle almost full of milk.</p>

<p><q>You certainly took your time,</q> said Taine, slightly irritated.</p>

<p><q>I got interested,</q> Beasly explained.</p>

<p><q>Interested in what?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, there were three big trucks and they were lugging a lot of heavy stuff down into the basement. Two or three big cabinets and a lot of other junk. And you know Abbie&#8217;s television set? Well, they took the set away. I told them that they shouldn&#8217;t, but they took it anyway.</q></p>

<p><q>I forgot,</q> said Taine. <q>Henry said he&#8217;d send the computer over and I plumb forgot.</q></p>

<p>Taine ate the sandwiches, sharing them with Towser, who was very grateful in a muddy way.</p>

<p>Finished, Taine rose and picked up his shovel.</p>

<p><q>Let&#8217;s get to work,</q> he said.</p>

<p><q>But you got all that stuff down in the basement.</q></p>

<p><q>That can wait,</q> said Taine. <q>This job we have to finish.</q></p>

<p>It was getting dusk by the time they finished.</p>

<p>Taine leaned wearily on his shovel.</p>

<p>Twelve feet by twenty across the top and ten feet deep&#8212;and all of it, every bit of it, made of the milk-glass stuff that sounded like a bell when you whacked it with a shovel.</p>

<p>They&#8217;d have to be small, he thought, if there were many of them, to live in a space that size, especially if they had to stay there very long.</p>

<p>And that fitted in, of course, for if they weren&#8217;t small they couldn&#8217;t now be living in the space between the basement joists.</p>

<p>If they were really living there, thought Taine. If it wasn&#8217;t all just a lot of supposition.</p>

<p>Maybe, he thought, even if they had been living in the house, they might be there no longer&#8212;for Towser had smelled or heard or somehow sensed them in the morning, but by that very night he&#8217;d paid them no attention.</p>

<p>Taine slung his shovel across his shoulder and hoisted the pick.</p>

<p><q>Come on,</q> he said, <q>let&#8217;s go. We&#8217;ve put in a long, hard day.</q></p>

<p>They tramped out through the brush and reached the road. Fireflies were flickering off and on in the woody darkness and the street lamps were swaying in the summer breeze. The stars were hard and bright.</p>

<p>Maybe they still were in the house, thought Taine. Maybe when they found out that Towser had objected to them, they had fixed it so he&#8217;d be aware of them no longer.</p>

<p>They probably were highly adaptive. It stood to good reason they would have to be. It hadn&#8217;t taken them too long, he told himself grimly, to adapt to a human house.</p>

<p>He and Beasly went up the gravel driveway in the dark to put the tools away in the garage and there was something funny going on, for there was no garage.</p>

<p>There was no garage and there was no front on the house and the driveway was cut off abruptly and there was nothing but the curving wall of what apparently had been the end of the garage.</p>

<p>They came up to the curving wall and stopped, squinting unbelieving in the summer dark.</p>

<p>There was no garage, no porch, no front of the house at all. It was as if someone had taken the opposite corners of the front of the house and bent them together until they touched, folding the entire front of the building inside the curvature of the bent-together corners.</p>

<p>Taine now had a curved-front house. Although it was, actually, not as simple as all that, for the curvature was not in proportion to what actually would have happened in case of such a feat. The curve was long and graceful and somehow not quite apparent. It was as if the front of the house had been eliminated and an illusion of the rest of the house had been summoned to mask the disappearance.</p>

<p>Taine dropped the shovel and the pick and they clattered on the driveway gravel. He put his hand up to his face and wiped it across his eyes, as if to clear his eyes of something that could not possibly be there.</p>

<p>And when he took the hand away it had not changed a bit.</p>

<p>There was no front to the house.</p>

<p>Then he was running around the house, hardly knowing he was running, and there was a fear inside of him at what had happened to the house.</p>

<p>But the back of the house was all right. It was exactly as it had always been.</p>

<p>He clattered up the stoop with Beasly and Towser running close behind him. He pushed open the door and burst into the entry and scrambled up the stairs into the kitchen and went across the kitchen in three strides to see what had happened to the front of the house.</p>

<p>At the door between the kitchen and the living room he stopped and his hands went out to grasp the door jamb as he stared in disbelief at the windows of the living room.</p>

<p>It was night outside. There could be no doubt of that. He had seen the fireflies flickering in the brush and weeds and the street lamps had been lit and the stars were out.</p>

<p>But a flood of sunlight was pouring through the windows of the living room and out beyond the windows lay a land that was not Willow Bend.</p>

<p><q>Beasly,</q> he gasped, <q>look out there in front!</q></p>

<p>Beasly looked.</p>

<p><q>What place is that?</q> he asked.</p>

<p><q>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to know.</q></p>

<p>Towser had found his dish and was pushing it around the kitchen floor with his nose, by way of telling Taine that it was time to eat.</p>

<p>Taine went across the living room and opened the front door. The garage, he saw, was there. The pickup stood with its nose against the open garage door and the car was safe inside.</p>

<p>There was nothing wrong with the front of the house at all.</p>

<p>But if the front of the house was all right, that was all that was.</p>

<p>For the driveway was chopped off just a few feet beyond the tail end of the pickup and there was no yard or woods or road. There was just a desert&#8212;a flat, far-reaching desert, level as a floor, with occasional boulder piles and haphazard clumps of vegetation and all of the ground covered with sand and pebbles. A big blinding sun hung just above a horizon that seemed much too far away and a funny thing about it was that the sun was in the north, where no proper sun should be. It had a peculiar whiteness, too.</p>

<p>Beasly stepped out on the porch and Taine saw that he was shivering like a frightened dog.</p>

<p><q>Maybe,</q> Taine told him, kindly, &#8216;<q>you&#8217;d better go back in and start making us some supper.</q></p>

<p><q>But, Hiram-</q></p>

<p><q>It&#8217;s all right,</q> said Taine. <q>It&#8217;s bound to be all right.</q></p>

<p><q>If you say so, Hiram.</q></p>

<p>He went in and the screen door banged behind him and in a minute Taine heard him in the kitchen.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t blame Beasly for shivering, he admitted to himself. It was a sort of shock to step out of your front door into an unknown land. A man might eventually get used to it, of course, but it would take some doing.</p>

<p>He stepped down off the porch and walked around the truck and around the garage corner and when he rounded the corner he was half prepared to walk back into familiar Willow Bend&#8212;for when he had gone in the back door the village had been there.</p>

<p>There was no Willow Bend. There was more of the desert, a great deal more of it.</p>

<p>He walked around the house and there was no back to the house. The back of the house now was just the same as the front had been before&#8212;the same smooth curve pulling the sides of the house together.</p>

<p>He walked on around the house to the front again and there was desert all the way. And the front was still all right. It hadn&#8217;t changed at all. The truck was there on the chopped-off driveway and the garage was open and the car inside.</p>

<p>Taine walked out a way into the desert and hunkered down and scooped up a handful of the pebbles and the pebbles were just pebbles.</p>

<p>He squatted there and let the pebbles trickle through his fingers.</p>

<p>In Willow Bend there was a back door and there wasn&#8217;t any front. Here, wherever here might be, there was a front door, but there wasn&#8217;t any back.</p>

<p>He stood up and tossed the rest of the pebbles away and wiped his dusty hands upon his breeches.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye he caught a sense of movement on the porch and there they were.</p>

<p>A line of tiny animals, if animals they were, came marching down the steps, one behind another. They were four inches high or so and they went on all four feet, although it was plain to see that their front feet were really hands, not feet. They had ratlike faces that were vaguely human, with noses long and pointed. They looked as if they might have scales instead of hide, for their bodies glistened with a rippling motion as they walked. And all of them had tails that looked very much like the coiled-wire tails one finds on certain toys and the tails stuck straight up above them, quivering as they walked.</p>

<p>They came down the steps in single file, in perfect military order, with half a foot or so of spacing between each one of them.</p>

<p>They came down the steps and walked out into the desert in a straight, undeviating line as if they knew exactly where they might be bound. There was something deadly purposeful about them and yet they didn&#8217;t hurry.</p>

<p>Taine counted sixteen of them and he watched them go out into the desert until they were almost lost to sight.</p>

<p>There go the ones, he thought, who came to live with me. They are the ones who fixed up the ceiling and who repaired Abbie&#8217;s television set and jiggered up the stove and radio. And more than likely, too, they were the ones who had come to Earth in the strange milk-glass contraption out there in the woods.</p>

<p>And if they had come to Earth in that deal out in the woods, then what sort of place was this?</p>

<p>He climbed the porch and opened the screen door and saw the neat, six-inch circle his departing guests had achieved in the screen to get out of the house. He made a mental note that some day, when he had the time, he would have to fix it.</p>

<p>He went in and slammed the door behind him.</p>

<p><q>Beasly,</q> he shouted.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Towser crawled from beneath the love seat and apologized.</p>

<p><q>It&#8217;s all right, pal,</q> said Taine. <q>That outfit scared me, too.</q></p>

<p>He went into the kitchen. The dim ceiling light shone on the overturned coffee pot, the broken cup in the center of the floor, the upset bowl of eggs. One broken egg was a white and yellow gob on the linoleum.</p>

<p>He stepped down on the landing and saw that the screen door in the back was wrecked beyond repair. Its rusty mesh was broken&#8212;exploded might have been a better word&#8212;and a part of the frame was smashed.</p>

<p>Taine looked at it in wondering admiration.</p>

<p><q>The poor fool,</q> he said. <q>He went straight through it without opening it at all.</q></p>

<p>He snapped on the light and went down the basement stairs. Halfway down he stopped in utter wonderment.</p>

<p>To his left was a wall&#8212;a wall of the same sort of material as had been used to put in the ceiling.</p>

<p>He stooped and saw that the wall ran clear across the basement, floor to ceiling, shutting off the workshop area.</p>

<p>And inside the workshop, what?</p>

<p>For one thing, he remembered, the computer that Henry had sent over just this morning. Three trucks, Beasly had said&#8212;three truckloads of equipment delivered straight into their paws!</p>

<p>Taine sat down weakly on the steps.</p>

<p>They must have thought, he told himself, that he was co-operating! Maybe they had figured that he knew what they were about and so went along with them. Or perhaps they thought he was paying them for fixing up the TV set and the stove and radio.</p>

<p>But to tackle first things first, why had they repaired the TV set and the stove and radio? As a sort of rental payment? As a friendly gesture? Or as a sort of practice run to find out what they could about this world&#8217;s technology? To find, perhaps, how their technology could be adapted to the materials and conditions on this planet they had found?</p>

<p>Taine raised a hand and rapped with his knuckles on the wall beside the stairs and the smooth white surface gave out a pinging sound.</p>

<p>He laid his ear against the wall and listened closely and it seemed to him he could hear a low-key humming, but if so it was so faint he could not be absolutely sure.</p>

<p>Banker Stevens&#8217; lawn mower was in there, behind the wall, and a lot of other stuff waiting for repair. They&#8217;d take the hide right off him, he thought, especially Banker Stevens. Stevens was a tight man.</p>

<p>Beasly must have been half-crazed with fear, he thought. When he had seen those things coming up out of the basement, he&#8217;d gone clean off his rocker. He&#8217;d gone straight through the door without even bothering to try to open it and now he was down in the village yapping to anyone who&#8217;d stop to listen to him.</p>

<p>No one ordinarily would pay Beasly much attention, but if he yapped long enough and wild enough, they&#8217;d probably do some checking. They&#8217;d come storming up here and they&#8217;d give the place a going over and they&#8217;d stand goggle-eyed at what they found in front and pretty soon some of them would have worked their way around to sort of running things.</p>

<p>And it was none of their business, Taine stubbornly told himself, his ever-present business sense rising to the fore. There was a lot of real estate lying around out there in his front yard and the only way anyone could get to it was by going through the house. That being the case, it stood to reason that all that land out there was his. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t any good at all. There might be nothing there. But before he had other people overrunning it, he&#8217;d better check and see.</p>

<p>He went up the stairs and out into the garage.</p>

<p>The sun was still just above the northern horizon and there was nothing moving.</p>

<p>He found a hammer and some nails and a few short lengths of plank in the garage and took them in the house.</p>

<p>Towser, he saw, had taken advantage of the situation and was sleeping in the gold-upholstered chair. Taine didn&#8217;t bother him.</p>

<p>Taine locked the back door and nailed some planks across it. He locked the kitchen and the bedroom windows and nailed planks across them, too.</p>

<p>That would hold the villagers for a while, he told himself, when they came tearing up here to see what was going on.</p>

<p>He got his deer rifle, a box of cartridges, a pair of binoculars and an old canteen out of a closet. He filled the canteen at the kitchen tap and stuffed a sack with food for him and Towser to eat along the way, for there was no time to wait and eat.</p>

<p>Then he went into the living room and dumped Towser out of the gold-upholstered chair.</p>

<p><q>Come on, Tows,</q> he said. <q>We&#8217;ll go and look things over.</q> He checked the gasoline in the pickup and the tank was almost full. He and the dog got in and he put the rifle within easy reach. Then he backed the truck and swung it around and headed out, north, across the desert.</p>

<p>It was easy traveling. The desert was as level as a floor. At times it got a little rough, but no worse than a lot of the back roads he traveled hunting down antiques.</p>

<p>The scenery didn&#8217;t change. Here and there were low hills, but the desert itself kept on mostly level, unraveling itself into that far-off horizon. Taine kept on driving north, straight into the sun. He hit some sandy stretches, but the sand was firm and hard and he had no trouble.</p>

<p>Half an hour out he caught up with the band of things&#8212;all sixteen of them&#8212;that had left the house. They were still traveling in line at their steady pace.</p>

<p>Slowing down the truck, Taine traveled parallel with them for a time, but there was no profit in it; they kept on traveling their course, looking neither right nor left.</p>

<p>Speeding up, Taine left them behind.</p>

<p>The sun stayed in the north, unmoving, and that certainly was queer. Perhaps, Taine told himself, this world spun on its axis far more slowly than the Earth and the day was longer. From the way the sun appeared to be standing still, perhaps a good deal longer.</p>

<p>Hunched above the wheel, staring out into the endless stretch of desert, the strangeness of it struck him for the first time with its full impact.</p>

<p>This was another world&#8212;there could be no doubt of that&#8212;another planet circling another star, and where it was in actual space no one on Earth could have the least idea. And yet, through some machination of those sixteen things walking straight in line, it also was lying just outside the front door of his house.</p>

<p>Ahead of him a somewhat larger hill loomed out of the flatness of the desert. As he drew nearer to it, he made out a row of shining objects lined upon its crest. After a time he stopped the truck and got out with the binoculars.</p>

<p>Through the glasses, he saw that the shining things were the same sort of milk-glass contraptions as had been in the woods. He counted eight of them, shining in the sun, perched upon some sort of rock-gray cradles. And there were other cradles empty.</p>

<p>He took the binoculars from his eyes and stood there for a moment, considering the advisibility of climbing the hill and investigating closely. But he shook his head. There&#8217;d be time for that later on. He&#8217;d better keep on moving. This was not a real exploring foray, but a quick reconnaissance.</p>

<p>He climbed into the truck and drove on, keeping watch upon the gas gauge. When it came close to half full he&#8217;d have to turn around and go back home again.</p>

<p>Ahead of him he saw a faint whiteness above the dim horizon line and he watched it narrowly. At times it faded away and then came in again, but whatever it might be was so far off he could make nothing of it.</p>

<p>He glanced down at the gas gauge and it was close to the halfway mark. He stopped the pickup and got out with the binoculars.</p>

<p>As he moved around to the front of the machine he was puzzled at how slow and tired his legs were and then remembered&#8212;he should have been in bed many hours ago. He looked at his watch and it was two o&#8217;clock and that meant, back on Earth, two o&#8217;clock in the morning. He had been awake for more than twenty hours and much of that time he had been engaged in the backbreaking work of digging out the strange thing in the woods.</p>

<p>He put up the binoculars and the elusive white line that he had been seeing turned out to be a range of mountains. The great, blue, craggy mass towered up above the desert with the gleam of snow on its peaks and ridges. They were a long way off, for even the powerful glasses brought them in as little more than a misty blueness.</p>

<p>He swept the glasses slowly back and forth and the mountains extended for a long distance above the horizon line.</p>

<p>He brought the glasses down off the mountains and examined the desert that stretched ahead of him. There was more of the same that he had been seeing&#8212;the same floorlike levelness, the same occasional mounds, the self-same scraggy vegetation.</p>

<p>And a house!</p>

<p>His hands trembled and he lowered the glasses, then put them up to his face again and had another look. It was a house, all right. A funny-looking house standing at the foot of one of the hillocks, still shadowed by the hillock so that one could not pick it out with the naked eye.</p>

<p>It seemed to be a small house. Its roof was like a blunted cone and it lay tight against the ground, as if it hugged or crouched against the ground. There was an oval opening that probably was a door, but there was no sign of windows.</p>

<p>He took the binoculars down again and stared at the hillock. Four or five miles away, he thought. The gas would stretch that far and even if it didn&#8217;t he could walk the last few miles into Willow Bend.</p>

<p>It was queer, he thought, that a house should be all alone out here. In all the miles he&#8217;d traveled in the desert he&#8217;d seen no sign of life beyond the sixteen little ratlike things that marched in single file, no sign of artificial structure other than the eight milk-glass contraptions resting in their cradles.</p>

<p>He climbed into the pickup and put it into gear. Ten minutes later he drew up in front of the house, which still lay within the shadow of the hillock.</p>

<p>He got out of the pickup and hauled his rifle after him. Towser leaped to the ground and stood with his hackles up, a deep growl in his throat.</p>

<p><q>What&#8217;s the matter, boy?</q> asked Taine.</p>

<p>Towser growled again.</p>

<p>The house stood silent. It seemed to be deserted.</p>

<p>The walls were built, Taine saw, of rude, rough masonry crudely set together, with a crumbling, mudlike substance used in lieu of mortar. The roof originally had been of sod and that was queer, indeed, for there was nothing that came close to sod upon this expanse of desert. But now, although one could see the lines where the sod strips had been fitted together, it was nothing more than earth baked hard by the desert sun.</p>

<p>The house itself was featureless, entirely devoid of any ornament, with no attempt at all to soften the harsh utility of it as a simple shelter. It was the sort of thing that a shepherd people might have put together. It had the look of age about it; the stone had flaked and crumbled in the weather.</p>

<p>Rifle slung beneath his arm, Taine paced toward it. He reached the door and glanced inside and there was darkness and no movement.</p>

<p>He glanced back for Towser and saw that the dog had crawled beneath the truck and was peering out and growling.</p>

<p><q>You stick around,</q> said Taine. <q>Don&#8217;t go running off.</q></p>

<p>With the rifle thrust before him, Taine stepped through the door into the darkness. He stood for a long moment to allow his eyes to become accustomed to the gloom.</p>

<p>Finally he could make out the room in which he stood. It was plain and rough, with a rude stone bench along one wall and queer unfunctional niches hollowed in another. One rickety piece of wooden furniture stood in a corner, but Taine could not make out what its use might be.</p>

<p>An old and deserted place, he thought, abandoned long ago. Perhaps a shepherd people might have lived here in some long-gone age, when the desert had been a rich and grassy plain.</p>

<p>There was a door into another room and as he stepped through it he heard the faint, far-off booming sound and something else as well&#8212; the sound of pouring rain! From the open door that led out through the back he caught a whiff of salty breeze and he stood there frozen in the center of that second room.</p>

<p>Another one!</p>

<p>Another house that led to another world!</p>

<p>He walked slowly forward, drawn toward the outer door, and he stepped out into a cloudy, darkling day with the rain streaming down from wildly racing clouds. Half a mile away, across a field of jumbled broken, iron-gray boulders, lay a pounding sea that raged upon the coast, throwing great spumes of angry spray high into the air.</p>

<p>He walked out from the door and looked up at the sky, and the rain drops pounded at his face with a stinging fury. There was a chill and a dampness in the air and the place was eldritch&#8212;a world jerked straight from some ancient Gothic tale of goblin and of sprite.</p>

<p>He glanced around and there was nothing he could see, for the rain blotted out the world beyond this stretch of coast, but behind the rain he could sense or seemed to sense a presence that sent shivers down his spine. Gulping in fright, Taine turned around and stumbled back again through the door into the house.</p>

<p>One world away, he thought, was far enough; two worlds away was more than one could take. He trembled at the sense of utter loneliness that tumbled in his skull and suddenly this long-forsaken house became unbearable and he dashed out of it.</p>

<p>Outside the sun was bright and there was welcome warmth. His clothes were damp from rain and little beads of moisture lay on the rifle barrel.</p>

<p>He looked around for Towser and there was no sign of the dog. He was not underneath the pickup; he was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>Taine called and there was no answer. His voice sounded lone and hollow in the emptiness and silence.</p>

<p>He walked around the house, looking for the dog, and there was no back door to the house. The rough rock walls of the sides of the house pulled in with that funny curvature and there was no back to the house at all.</p>

<p>But Taine was not interested; he had known how it would be. Right now he was looking for his dog and he felt the panic rising in him. Somehow it felt a long way from home.</p>

<p>He spent three hours at it. He went back into the house and Towser was not there. He went into the other world again and searched among the tumbled rocks and Towser was not there. He went back to the desert and walked around the hillock and then he climbed to the crest of it and used the binoculars and saw nothing but the lifeless desert, stretching far in all directions.</p>

<p>Dead-beat with weariness, stumbling, half asleep even as he walked, he went back to the pickup.</p>

<p>He leaned against it and tried to pull his wits together.</p>

<p>Continuing as he was would be a useless effort. He had to get some sleep. He had to go back to Willow Bend and fill the tank and get some extra gasoline so that he could range farther afield in his search for Towser.</p>

<p>He couldn&#8217;t leave the dog out here&#8212;that was unthinkable. But he had to plan, he had <em>to</em> act intelligently. He would be doing Towser no good by stumbling around in his present shape.</p>

<p>He pulled himself into the truck and headed back for Willow Bend, following the occasional faint impressions that his tires had made in the sandy places, fighting a half-dead drowsiness that tried to seal his eyes shut.</p>

<p>Passing the higher hill on which the milk-glass things had stood, he stopped to walk around a bit so he wouldn&#8217;t fall asleep behind the wheel. And now, he saw, there were only seven of the things resting in their cradles.</p>

<p>But that meant nothing to him now. All that meant anything was to hold off the fatigue that was closing down upon him, to cling to the wheel and wear off the miles, to get back to Willow Bend and get some sleep and then come back again to look for Towser.</p>

<p>Slightly more than halfway home he saw the other car and watched it in numb befuddlement, for this truck that he was driving and the car at home in his garage were the only two vehicles this side of his house.</p>

<p>He pulled the pickup to a halt and tumbled out of it.</p>

<p>The car drew up and Henry Horton and Beasly and a man who wore a star leaped quickly out of it.</p>

<p><q>Thank God we found you, man!</q> cried Henry, striding over to him.</p>

<p><q>I wasn&#8217;t lost,</q> protested Taine. <q>I was coming back.</q></p>

<p><q>He&#8217;s all beat out,</q> said the man who wore the star.</p>

<p><q>This is Sheriff Hanson,</q> Henry said. <q>We were following your tracks.</q></p>

<p><q>I lost Towser,</q> Taine mumbled. <q>I had to go and leave him. Just leave me be and go and hunt for Towser. I can make it home.</q></p>

<p>He reached out and grabbed the edge of the pickup&#8217;s door to hold himself erect.</p>

<p><q>You broke down the door,</q> he said to Henry. <q>You broke into my house and you took my car&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>We had to do it, Hiram. We were afraid that something might have happened to you. The way that Beasly told it, it stood your hair on end.</q></p>

<p><q>You better get him in the car,</q> the sheriff said. <q>I&#8217;ll drive the pickup back.</q></p>

<p><q>But I have to hunt for Towser!</q></p>

<p><q>You can&#8217;t do anything until you&#8217;ve had some rest.</q></p>

<p>Henry grabbed him by the arm and led him to the car and Beasly held the rear door open.</p>

<p><q>You got any idea what this place is?</q> Henry whispered conspiratorially.</p>

<p><q>I don&#8217;t positively know,</q> Taine mumbled. <q>Might be some other&#8212;</q></p>

<p>Henry chuckled. <q>Well, I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter. Whatever it may be, it&#8217;s put us on the map. We&#8217;re in all the newscasts and the papers are plastering us in headlines and the town is swarming with reporters and cameramen and there are big officials coming. Yes, sir, I tell you, Hiram, this will be the making of us&#8212;</q></p>

<p>Taine heard no more. He was fast asleep before he hit the seat.</p>

<p>He came awake and lay quietly in the bed and he saw the shades were drawn and the room was cool and peaceful.</p>

<p>It was good, he thought, to wake in a room you knew&#8212;in a room that one had known for his entire life, in a house that had been the Taine house for almost a hundred years.</p>

<p>Then memory clouted him and he sat bolt upright.</p>

<p>And now he heard it&#8212;the insistent murmur from outside the window.</p>

<p>He vaulted from the bed and pulled one shade aside. Peering out, he saw the cordon of troops that held back the crowd that overflowed his back yard and the back yards back of that.</p>

<p>He let the shade drop back and started hunting for his shoes, for he was fully dressed. Probably Henry and Beasly, he told himself, had dumped him into bed and pulled off his shoes and let it go at that. But he couldn&#8217;t remember a single thing of it. He must have gone dead to the world the minute Henry had bundled him into the back seat of the car.</p>

<p>He found the shoes on the floor at the end of the bed and sat down upon the bed to pull them on.</p>

<p>And his mind was racing on what he had to do.</p>

<p>He&#8217;d have to get some gasoline somehow and fill up the truck and stash an extra can or two into the back and he&#8217;d have to take some food and water and perhaps his sleeping bag. For he wasn&#8217;t coming back until he found his dog.</p>

<p>He got on his shoes and tied them, then went out into the living room. There was no one there, but there were voices in the kitchen.</p>

<p>He looked out the window and the desert lay outside, unchanged. The sun, he noticed, had climbed higher in the sky, but out in his front yard it was still forenoon.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch and it was six o&#8217;clock and from the way the shadows had been falling when he&#8217;d peered out of the bedroom window, he knew that it was 6:00 p.m. He realized with a guilty start that he must have slept almost around the clock. He had not meant to sleep that long. He hadn&#8217;t meant to leave Towser out there that long.</p>

<p>He headed for the kitchen and there were three persons there&#8212;Abbie and Henry Horton and a man in military garb.</p>

<p><q>There you are,</q> cried Abbie merrily. <q>We were wondering when you would wake up.</q></p>

<p><q>You have some coffee cooking, Abbie?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, a whole pot full of it. And I&#8217;ll cook up something else for you.</q></p>

<p><q>Just some toast,</q> said Taine. <q>I haven&#8217;t got much time. I have to hunt for Towser.</q></p>

<p><q>Hiram,</q> said Henry, <q>this is Colonel Ryan, National Guard. He has his boys outside.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I saw them through the window.</q></p>

<p><q>Necessary,</q> said Henry. <q>Absolutely necessary. The sheriff couldn&#8217;t handle it. The people came rushing in and they&#8217;d have torn the place apart. So I called the governor.</q></p>

<p><q>Taine,</q> the colonel said, <q>sit down. I want to talk with you.</q></p>

<p><q>Certainly,</q> said Taine, taking a chair. <q>Sorry to be in such a rush, but I lost my dog out there.</q></p>

<p><q>This business,</q> said the colonel, smugly, <q>is vastly more important than any dog could be.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, colonel, that just goes to show that you don&#8217;t know Towser. He&#8217;s the best dog I ever had and I&#8217;ve had a lot of them. Raised him from a pup and he&#8217;s been a good friend all these years&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>All right,</q> the colonel said, <q>so he is a friend. But still I have to talk with you.</q></p>

<p><q>You just sit and talk,</q> Abbie said to Taine. <q>I&#8217;ll fix up some cakes and Henry brought over some of that sausage that we get out on the farm.</q></p>

<p>The back door opened and Beasly staggered in to the accompaniment of a terrific metallic banging. He was carrying three empty five-gallon gas cans in one hand and two in the other hand and they were bumping and banging together as he moved.</p>

<p><q>Say,</q> yelled Taine, <q>what&#8217;s going on here?</q></p>

<p><q>Now, just take it easy,</q> Henry said. <q>You have no idea the problems that we have. We wanted to get a big gas tank moved through here, but we couldn&#8217;t do it. We tried to rip out the back of the kitchen to get it through, but we couldn&#8217;t&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>You did what!</q></p>

<p><q>We tried to rip out the back of the kitchen,</q> Henry told him calmly. <q>You can&#8217;t get one of those big storage tanks through an ordinary door. But when we tried, we found that the entire house is boarded up inside with the same kind of material that you used down in the basement. You hit it with an axe and it blunts the steel&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>But, Henry, this is my house and there isn&#8217;t anyone who has the right to start tearing it apart.</q></p>

<p><q>Fat chance,</q> the colonel said. <q>What I would like to know, Taine, what is that stuff that we couldn&#8217;t break through?</q></p>

<p><q>Now you take it easy, Hiram,</q> cautioned Henry. <q>We have a big new world waiting for us out there&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>It isn&#8217;t waiting for you or anyone,</q> yelled Taine.</p>

<p><q>And we have to explore it and to explore it we need a stockpile of gasoline. So since we can&#8217;t have a storage tank, we&#8217;re getting together as many gas cans as possible and then we&#8217;ll run a hose through here&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>But, Henry-</q></p>

<p><q>I wish,</q> said Henry sternly, <q>that you&#8217;d quit interrupting me and let me have my say. You can&#8217;t even imagine the logistics that we face. We&#8217;re bottlenecked by the size of a regulation door. We have to get supplies out there and we have to get transport. Cars and trucks won&#8217;t be so bad. We can disassemble them and lug them through piecemeal, but a plane will be a problem.</q></p>

<p><q>You listen to me, Henry. There isn&#8217;t anyone going to haul a plane through here. This house has been in my family for almost a hundred years and I own it and I have a right to it and you can&#8217;t come in highhanded and start hauling stuff through it.</q></p>

<p><q>But,</q> said Henry plaintively, <q>we need a plane real bad. You can cover so much more ground when you have a plane.</q></p>

<p>Beasly went banging through the kitchen with his cans and out into the living room.</p>

<p>The colonel sighed. <q>I had hoped, Mr. Taine, that you would understand how the matter stood. To me it seems very plain that it&#8217;s your patriotic duty to cooperate with us in this. The government, of course, could exercise the right of eminent domain and start condemnation action, but it would rather not do that. I&#8217;m speaking unofficially, of course, but I think it&#8217;s safe to say the government would much prefer to arrive at an amicable agreement.</q></p>

<p><q>I doubt,</q> Taine said, bluffing, not knowing anything about it, <q>that the right to eminent domain would be applicable. As I understand it, it applies to buildings and to roads&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>This is a road,</q> the colonel told him flatly. <q>A road right through your house to another world.</q></p>

<p><q>First,</q> Taine declared, <q>the government would have to show it was in the public interest and that refusal of the owner to relinquish title amounted to an interference in government procedure and&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>I think,</q> the colonel said, <q>that the government can prove it is in the public interest.</q></p>

<p><q>I think,</q> Taine said angrily, <q>I better get a lawyer.</q></p>

<p><q>If you really mean that,</q> Henry offered, ever helpful, <q>and you want to get a good one&#8212;and I presume you do&#8212;I would be pleased to recommend a firm that I am sure would represent your interests most ably and be, at the same time, fairly reasonable in cost.</q></p>

<p>The colonel stood up, seething. <q>You&#8217;ll have a lot to answer, Taine. There&#8217;ll be a lot of things the government will want to know. First of all, they&#8217;ll want to know just how you engineered this. Are you ready to tell that?</q></p>

<p><q>No,</q> said Taine, <q>I don&#8217;t believe I am.</q></p>

<p>And he thought with some alarm: They think that I&#8217;m the one who did it and they&#8217;ll be down on me like a pack of wolves to find out just how I did it. He had visions of the FBI and the state department and the Pentagon and, even sitting down, he felt shaky in the knees.</p>

<p>The colonel turned around and marched stiffly from the kitchen. He went out the back and slammed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Henry looked at Taine speculatively.</p>

<p><q>Do you really mean it?</q> he demanded. <q>Do you intend to stand up to them?</q></p>

<p><q>I&#8217;m getting sore,</q> said Taine. <q>They can&#8217;t come in here and take over without even asking me. I don&#8217;t care what anyone may think, this is my house. I was born here and I&#8217;ve lived here all my life and I like the place and&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>Sure,</q> said Henry. <q>I know just how you feel.</q></p>

<p><q>I suppose it&#8217;s childish of me, but I wouldn&#8217;t mind so much if they showed a willingness to sit down and talk about what they meant to do once they&#8217;d taken over. But there seems no disposition to even ask me what I think about it. And I tell you, Henry, this is different than it seems. This isn&#8217;t a place where we can walk in and take over, no matter what Washington may think. There&#8217;s something out there and we better watch our step&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>I was thinking,</q> Henry interrupted, <q class="continued">as I was sitting here, that your attitude is most commendable and deserving of support. It has occurred to me that it would be most unneighborly of me to go on sitting here and leave you in the fight alone. We could hire ourselves a fine array of legal talent and we could fight the case and in the meantime we could form a land and development company and that way we could make sure that this new world of yours is used the way it should be used.</q></p>

<p><q>It stands to reason, Hiram, that I am the one to stand beside you, shoulder to shoulder, in this business since we&#8217;re already partners in this TV deal.</q></p>

<p><q>What&#8217;s this about TV?</q> shrilled Abbie, slapping a plate of cakes down in front of Taine.</p>

<p><q>Now, Abbie,</q> Henry said patiently, <q>I have explained to you already that your TV set is back of that partition down in the basement and there isn&#8217;t any telling when we can get it out.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I know,</q> said Abbie, bringing a platter of sausages and pouring a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Beasly came in from the living room and went bumbling out the back.</p>

<p><q>After all,</q> said Henry, pressing his advantage, <q>I would suppose I had some hand in it. I doubt you could have done much without the computer I sent over,</q></p>

<p>And there it was again, thought Taine. Even Henry thought he&#8217;d been the one who did it.</p>

<p><q>But didn&#8217;t Beasly tell you?</q></p>

<p><q>Beasly said a lot, but you know how Beasly is.</q></p>

<p>And that was it, of course. To the villagers it would be no more than another Beasly story&#8212;another whopper that Beasly had dreamed up. There was no one who believed a word that Beasly said.</p>

<p>Taine picked up the cup and drank his coffee, gaining time to shape an answer and there wasn&#8217;t any answer. If he told the truth, it would sound far less believable than any lie he&#8217;d tell.</p>

<p><q>You can tell me, Hiram. After all, we&#8217;re partners.</q></p>

<p>He&#8217;s playing me for a fool, thought Taine. Henry thinks he can play anyone he wants for a fool and sucker.</p>

<p><q>You wouldn&#8217;t believe me if I told you, Henry.</q></p>

<p><q>Well,</q> Henry said, resignedly, getting to his feet, <q>I guess that part of it can wait.</q></p>

<p>Beasly came tramping and banging through the kitchen with another load of cans.</p>

<p><q>I'll have to have some gasoline,</q> said Taine, <q>if I&#8217;m going out for Towser.</q></p>

<p><q>I&#8217;ll take care of that right away,</q> Henry promised smoothly. <q>I&#8217;ll send Ernie over with his tank wagon and we can run a hose through here and fill up those cans. And I&#8217;ll see if I can find someone who&#8217;ll go along with you.</q></p>

<p><q>That&#8217;s not necessary. I can go alone.</q></p>

<p><q>If we had a radio transmitter. Then you could keep in touch.</q></p>

<p><q>But we haven&#8217;t any. And, Henry, I can&#8217;t wait. Towser&#8217;s out there somewhere&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>Sure, I know how much you thought of him. You go out and look for him if you think you have to and I&#8217;ll get started on this other business. I&#8217;ll get some lawyers lined up and we&#8217;ll draw up some sort of corporate papers for our land development&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>And, Hiram,</q> Abbie said, <q>will you do something for me, please?</q></p>

<p><q>Why, certainly,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p><q>Would you speak to Beasly. It&#8217;s senseless the way he&#8217;s acting. There wasn&#8217;t any call for him to up and leave us. I might have been a little sharp with him, but he&#8217;s so simple-minded he&#8217;s infuriating. He ran off and spent half a day helping Towser at digging out that woodchuck and-</q></p>

<p><q>I&#8217;ll speak to him,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p><q>Thanks, Hiram. He&#8217;ll listen to you. You&#8217;re the only one he&#8217;ll listen to. And I wish you could have fixed my TV set before all this came about. I&#8217;m just lost without it. It leaves a hole in the living room. It matched my other furniture, you know.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes I know,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p><q>Coming, Abbie?</q> Henry asked, standing at the door.</p>

<p>He lifted a hand in a confidential farewell to Taine. <q>I&#8217;ll see you later, Hiram. I&#8217;ll get it all fixed up.</q></p>

<p>I just bet you will, thought Taine.</p>

<p>He went back to the table, after they were gone, and sat down heavily in a chair.</p>

<p>The front door slammed and Beasly came panting in, excited.</p>

<p><q>Towser&#8217;s back!</q> he yelled. <q>He&#8217;s coming back and he&#8217;s driving in the biggest woodchuck you ever clapped your eyes on.</q></p>

<p>Taine leaped to his feet.</p>

<p><q>Woodchuck! That&#8217;s an alien planet. It hasn&#8217;t any woodchucks.</q></p>

<p><q>You come and see,</q> yelled Beasly.</p>

<p>He turned and raced back out again, with Taine following close behind.</p>

<p>It certainly looked considerably like a woodchuck&#8212;a sort of man-size woodchuck. More like a woodchuck out of a children&#8217;s book, perhaps, for it was walking on its hind legs and trying to look dignified even while it kept a weather eye on Towser.</p>

<p>Towser was back a hundred feet or so, keeping a wary distance from the massive chuck. He had the pose of a good sheep herding dog, walking in a crouch, alert to head off any break that the chuck might make.</p>

<p>The chuck came up close to the house and stopped. Then it did an about-face so that it looked back across the desert and it hunkered down.</p>

<p>It swung its massive head to gaze at Beasly and Taine and in the limpid brown eyes Taine saw more than the eyes of an animal.</p>

<p>Taine walked swiftly out and picked up the dog in his arms and hugged him tight against him. Towser twisted his head around and slapped a sloppy tongue across his master&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>Taine stood with the dog in his arms and looked at the man-size chuck and felt a great relief and an utter thankfulness.</p>

<p>Everything was all right now, he thought. Towser had come back.</p>

<p>He headed for the house and out into the kitchen.</p>

<p>He put Towser down and got a dish and filled it at the tap. He placed it on the floor and Towser lapped at it thirstily, slopping water all over the linoleum.</p>

<p><q>Take it easy, there,</q> warned Taine. <q>You don&#8217;t want to overdo it.</q></p>

<p>He hunted in the refrigerator and found some scraps and put them in Towser&#8217;s dish.</p>

<p>Towser wagged his tail with doggish happiness.</p>

<p><q>By rights,</q> said Taine, <q>I ought to take a rope to you, running off like that.</q> </p>

<p>Beasly came ambling in.</p>

<p><q>That chuck is a friendly cuss,</q> he announced. <q>He&#8217;s waiting for someone.</q></p>

<p><q>That&#8217;s nice,</q> said Taine, paying no attention.</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock.</p>

<p><q>It&#8217;s seven-thirty,</q> he said. <q>We can catch the news. You want to get it Beasly?</q></p>

<p><q>Sure. I know right where to get it. That fellow from New York.</q></p>

<p><q>That&#8217;s the one,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p>He walked into the living room and looked out the window. The man-size chuck had not moved. He was sitting with his back to the house, looking back the way he&#8217;d come.</p>

<p>Waiting for someone, Beasly had said, and it looked as if he might be, but probably it was all just in Beasly&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>And if he were waiting for someone, Taine wondered, who might that someone be? <em>What</em> might that someone be? Certainly by now the word had spread out that there was a door into another world. And how many doors, he wondered, had been opened through the ages?</p>

<p>Henry had said that there was a big new world out there waiting for Earthmen to move in. And that wasn&#8217;t it at all. It was the other way around.</p>

<p>The voice of the news commentator came blasting from the radio in the middle of a sentence:</p>

<p><q class="continued">&#8230; finally got into the act. Radio Moscow said this evening that the Soviet delegate will make representations in the U.N. tomorrow for the internationalization of this other world and the gateway to it.</q></p>

<p><q>From that gateway itself, the home of a man named Hiram Taine, there is no news. Complete security had been clamped down and a cordon of troops form a solid wall around the house, holding back the crowds. Attempts to telephone the residence are blocked by a curt voice which says that no calls are being accepted for that number. And Taine himself has not stepped from the house.</q></p>

<p>Taine walked back into the kitchen and sat down.</p>

<p><q>He&#8217;s talking about you,</q> Beasly said importantly.</p>

<p><q class="continued">Rumor circulated this morning that Taine, a quiet village repair man and dealer in antiques, and until yesterday a relative unknown, had finally returned from a trip which he made out into this new and unknown land. But what he found, if anything, no one yet can say. Nor is there any further information about this other place beyond the fact that it is a desert and, to the moment, lifeless.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">A small flurry of excitement was occasioned late yesterday by the finding of some strange object in the woods across the road from the residence, but this area likewise was swiftly cordoned off and to the moment Colonel Ryan, who commands the troops, will say nothing of what actually was found.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Mystery man of the entire situation is one Henry Horton, who seems to be the only unofficial person to have entry to the Taine house. Horton, questioned earlier today, had little to say, but managed to suggest an air of great conspiracy. He hinted he and Taine were partners in some mysterious venture and left hanging in midair the half impression that he and Taine had collaborated in opening the new world.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Horton, it is interesting to note, operates a small computer plant and it is understood on good authority that only recently he delivered a computer to Taine, or at least some sort of machine to which considerable mystery is attached. One story is that this particular machine had been in the process of development for six or seven years.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Some of the answers to the matter of how all this did happen and what actually did happen must wait upon the findings of a team of scientists who left Washington this evening after an all-day conference at the White House, which was attended by representatives from the military, the state department, the security division and the special weapons section.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Throughout the world the impact of what happened yesterday at Willow Bend can only be compared to the sensation of the news, almost twenty years ago, of the dropping of the first atomic bomb. There is some tendency among many observers to believe that the implications of Willow Bend, in fact, may be even more earth-shaking than were those at Hiroshima.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">Washington insists, as is only natural, that this matter is of internal concern only and that it intends to handle the situation as it best affects the national welfare.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">But abroad there is a rising storm of insistence that this is not a matter of national policy concerning one nation, but that it necessarily must be a matter of worldwide concern.</q></p>

<p><q class="continued">There is an unconfirmed report that a U.N. observer will arrive in Willow Bend almost momentarily. France, Britain, Bolivia, Mexico and India have already requested permission of Washington to send observers to the scene and other nations undoubtedly plan to file similar requests.</q></p>

<p><q>The world sits on edge tonight, waiting for the word from Willow Bend and-</q></p>

<p>Taine reached out and clicked the radio to silence.</p>

<p><q>From the sound of it,</q> said Beasly, <q>we&#8217;re going to be overrun by a batch of foreigners.</q></p>

<p>Yes, thought Taine, there might be a batch of foreigners, but not exactly in the sense that Beasly meant. The use of the word, he told himself, so far as any human was concerned, must be outdated now. No man of Earth ever again could be called a foreigner with alien life next door&#8212;literally next door. What were the people of the stone house?</p>

<p>And perhaps not the alien life of one planet only, but the alien life of many. For he himself had found another door into yet another planet and there might be many more such doors and what would these other worlds be like, and what was the purpose of the doors?</p>

<p>Someone, <em>something</em>, had found a way of going to another planet short of spanning light-years of lonely space&#8212;a simpler and a shorter way than flying through the gulfs of space. And once the way was open, then the way stayed! open and it was as easy as walking from one room to another.</p>

<p>But one thing&#8212;one ridiculous thing&#8212;kept puzzling him and that was the spinning and the movement of the connected planets, of all the planets that must be linked together. You could not, he argued, establish solid, factual links between two objects that move independently of one another.</p>

<p>And yet, a couple of days ago, he would have contended just as stolidly that the whole idea on the face of it was fantastic and impossible. Still it had been done. And once one impossibility was accomplished, what logical man could say with sincerity that the second could not be?</p>

<p>The doorbell rang and he got up to answer it.</p>

<p>It was Ernie, the oil man.</p>

<p><q>Henry said you wanted some gas and I came to tell you I can&#8217;t get it until morning.</q></p>

<p><q>That&#8217;s all right,</q> said Taine. <q>I don&#8217;t need it now.</q></p>

<p>And swiftly slammed the door.</p>

<p>He leaned against it, (thinking: I&#8217;ll have to face them sometime. I can&#8217;t keep the door locked against the world. Sometime, soon or late, the Earth and I will have to have this out.</p>

<p>And it was foolish, he thought, for him to think like this, but that was the way it was.</p>

<p>He had something here that the Earth demanded; something that Earth wanted or thought it wanted. And yet, in the last analysis, it was his responsibility. It had happened on his land, it had happened in his house; unwittingly, perhaps, he&#8217;d even aided and abetted it.</p>

<p>And the land and house are mine, he fiercely told himself, and that world out there was an extension of his yard. No matter how far or where it went, an extension of his yard.</p>

<p>Beasly had left the kitchen and Taine walked into the living room. Towser was curled up and snoring gently in the gold-upholstered chair.</p>

<p>Taine decided he would let him stay there. After all, he thought, Towser had won the right to sleep anywhere he wished.</p>

<p>He walked past the chair to the window and the desert stretched to its far horizon and there before the window sat the man-size woodchuck and Beasly side by side, with their backs turned to the window and staring out across the desert.</p>

<p>Somehow it seemed natural that the chuck and Beasly should be sitting there together&#8212;the two of them, it appeared to Taine, might have a lot in common.</p>

<p>And it was a good beginning&#8212;that a man and an alien creature from this other world should sit down companionably together.</p>

<p>He tried to envision the setup of these linked worlds, of which Earth was now a part, and the possibilities that lay inherent in the fact of linkage rolled thunder through his brain.</p>

<p>There would be contact between the Earth and these other worlds and what would come of it?</p>

<p>And come to think of it, the contact had been made already, but so naturally, so undramatically, that it failed to register as a great, important meeting. For Beasly and the chuck out there were contact and if it all should go like that, there was absolutely nothing for one to worry over.</p>

<p>This was no haphazard business, he reminded himself. It had been planned and executed with the smoothness of long practice. This was not the first world to be opened and it would not be the last.</p>

<p>The little ratlike things had spanned space&#8212;how many light-years of space one could not even guess&#8212;in the vehicle which he had unearthed out in the woods. They then had buried it, perhaps as a child might hide a dish by shoving it into a pile of sand. Then they had come to this very house and had set up the apparatus that had made this house a tunnel between one world and another. And once that had been done, the need of crossing space had been canceled out forever. There need be but one crossing and that one crossing would serve to link the planets.</p>

<p>And once the job was done the little ratlike things had left, but not before they had made certain that this gateway to their planet would stand against no matter what assault. They had sheathed the house inside the studdings with a wonder-material that would resist an ax and that, undoubtedly, would resist much more than a simple ax.</p>

<p>And they had marched in drill-order single file out to the hill where eight more of the space machines had rested in their cradles. And now there were only seven there, in their cradles on the hill, and the rat-like things were gone and, perhaps, in time to come, they&#8217;d land on another planet and another doorway would be opened, a link to yet another world.</p>

<p>But more, Taine thought, than the linking of mere worlds. It would be, as well, the linking of the peoples of those worlds.</p>

<p>The little ratlike creatures were the explorers and the pioneers who sought out other Earthlike planets and the creature waiting with Beasly just outside the window must also serve its purpose and perhaps in time to come there would be a purpose which man would also serve.</p>

<p>He turned away from the window and looked around the room and the room was exactly as it had been ever since he could remember it. With all the change outside, with all that was happening outside, the room remained unchanged.</p>

<p>This is the reality, thought Taine, this is all the reality there is. Whatever else may happen, this is where I stand&#8212;this room with its fireplace blackened by many winter fires, the bookshelves with the old thumbed volumes, the easy-chair, the ancient worn carpet&#8212;worn by beloved and unforgotten feet through the many years.</p>

<p>And this also, he knew, was the lull before the storm.</p>

<p>In just a little while the brass would start arriving&#8212;the team of scientists, the governmental functionaries, the military, the observers from the other countries, the officials from the U.N.</p>

<p>And against all these, he realized, he stood weaponless and shorn of his strength. No matter what a man might say or think, he could not stand off the world.</p>

<p>This was the last day that this would be the Taine house. After almost a hundred years, it would have another destiny.</p>

<p>And for the first time in all those years there&#8217;d be no Taine asleep beneath its roof.</p>

<p>He stood looking at the fireplace and the shelves of books and he sensed the old, pale ghosts walking in the room and he lifted a hesitant hand as if to wave farewell, not only to the ghosts but to the room as well. But before he got it up, he dropped it to his side.</p>

<p>What was the use, he thought.</p>

<p>He went out to the porch and sat down on the steps.</p>

<p>Beasly heard him and turned around.</p>

<p><q>He&#8217;s nice,</q> he said to Taine, patting the chuck upon the back. <q>He&#8217;s exactly like a great big teddy bear.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I see,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p><q>And best of all, I can talk with him.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I know,</q> said Taine, remembering that Beasly could talk with Towser, too.</p>

<p>He wondered what it would be like to live in the simple world of Beasly. At times, he decided, it would be comfortable.</p>

<p>The ratlike things had come in the spaceship, but why had they come to Willow Bend, why had they picked this house, the only house in all the village where they would have found the equipment that they needed to build their apparatus so easily and so quickly? For there was no doubt that they had cannibalized the computer to get the equipment they needed. In that, at least, Henry had been right. Thinking back on it, Henry, after all, had played quite a part in it.</p>

<p>Could they have foreseen that on this particular week in this particular house the probability of quickly and easily doing what they had come to do had stood very high?</p>

<p>Did they, with all their other talents and technology, have clairvoyance as well?</p>

<p><q>There&#8217;s someone coming,</q> Beasly said.</p>

<p><q>I don&#8217;t see a thing.</q></p>

<p><q>Neither do I,</q> said Beasly, <q>but Chuck told me that he saw them.</q></p>

<p><q>Told you!</q></p>

<p><q>I told you we been talking. There, I can see them too.</q></p>

<p>They were far off, but they were coming fast&#8212;three dots rode rapidly out of the desert.</p>

<p>He sat and watched them come and he thought of going in to get the rifle, but he didn&#8217;t stir from his seat upon the steps. The rifle would do no good, he told himself. It would be a senseless thing to get it; more than that, a senseless attitude. The least that man could do, he thought, was to meet these creatures of another world with clean and empty hands.</p>

<p>They were closer now and it seemed to him that they were sitting in invisible chairs that traveled very fast.</p>

<p>He saw that they were humanoid, to a degree at least, and there were only three of them.</p>

<p>They came in with a rush and stopped very suddenly a hundred feet or so from where he sat upon the steps.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t move or say a word&#8212;there was nothing he could say. It was too ridiculous.</p>

<p>They were, perhaps, a little smaller than himself, and black as the ace of spades, and they wore skin tight shorts and vests that were some-what oversize and both the shorts and vests were the blue of April skies.</p>

<p>But that was not the worst of it.</p>

<p>They sat on saddles, with horns in front and stirrups and a sort of bedroll tied on the back, but they had no horses.</p>

<p>The saddles floated in the air, with the stirrups about three feet above the ground and the aliens sat easily in the saddles and stared at him and he stared back at them.</p>

<p>Finally he got up and moved forward a step or two and when he did that the three swung from the saddles and moved forward, too, while the saddles hung there in the air, exactly as they&#8217;d left them.</p>

<p>Taine walked forward and the three walked forward until they were no more than six feet apart.</p>

<p><q>They say hello to you,</q> said Beasly. <q>They say welcome to you.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, all right, then, tell them&#8212; Say, how do you know all this!</q></p>

<p><q>Chuck tells me what they say and I tell you. You tell me and I tell him and he tells them. That&#8217;s the way it works. That is what he&#8217;s here for.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, I&#8217;ll be-,</q> said Taine. <q>So you can really talk to him.</q></p>

<p><q>I told you that I could,</q> stormed Beasly. <q>I told you that I could talk to Towser, too, but you thought that I was crazy.</q></p>

<p><q>Telepathy!</q> said Taine. And it was worse than ever now. Not only had the ratlike things known all the rest of it, but they&#8217;d known of Beasly, too.</p>

<p><q>What was that you said, Hiram?</q></p>

<p><q>Never mind,</q> said Taine. <q>Tell that friend of yours to tell them I&#8217;m glad to meet them and what can I do for them?</q></p>

<p>He stood uncomfortably and stared at the three and he saw that their vests had many pockets and that the pockets were crammed, probably with their equivalent of tobacco and handkerchiefs and pocket knives and such.</p>

<p><q>They say,</q> said Beasly, <q>that they want to dicker.</q></p>

<p><q>Dicker?</q></p>

<p><q>Sure, Hiram. You know, trade.</q></p>

<p>Beasly chuckled thinly. <q>Imagine them laying themselves open to a Yankee trader. That&#8217;s what Henry says you are. He says you can skin a man on the slickest&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>Leave Henry out of this,</q> snapped Taine. <q>Let&#8217;s leave Henry out of something.</q></p>

<p>He sat down on the ground and the three sat down to face him.</p>

<p><q>Ask them what they have in mind to trade.</q></p>

<p><q>Ideas,</q> Beasly said.</p>

<p><q>Ideas! That&#8217;s a crazy thing&#8212;</q></p>

<p>And then he saw it wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Of all the commodities that might be exchanged by an alien people, ideas would be the most valuable and the easiest to handle. They&#8217;d take no cargo room and they&#8217;d upset no economies&#8212;not immediately, that is&#8212;and they&#8217;d make a bigger contribution to the welfare of the cultures than trade in actual goods.</p>

<p><q>Ask them,</q> said Taine, <q>what they&#8217;ll take for the idea back of those saddles they are riding.</q></p>

<p><q>They say, what have you to offer?</q></p>

<p>And that was the stumper. That was the one that would be hard to answer.</p>

<p>Automobiles and trucks, the internal gas engine&#8212;well, probably not. Because they already had the saddles. Earth was out of date in transportation from the viewpoint of these people.</p>

<p>Housing architecture&#8212;no, that was hardly an idea and, anyhow, there was that other house, so they knew of houses.</p>

<p>Cloth? No, they had cloth.</p>

<p>Paint, he thought. Maybe paint was it.</p>

<p><q>See if they are interested in paint,</q> Taine told Beasly.</p>

<p><q>They say, what is it? Please explain yourself.</q></p>

<p><q>O.K., then. Let&#8217;s see. It&#8217;s a protective device to be spread over almost any surface. Easily packaged and easily applied. Protects against weather and corrosion. It&#8217;s decorative, too. Comes in all sorts of colors. And its cheap to make.</q></p>

<p><q>They shrug in their mind,</q> said Beasly. <q>They&#8217;re just slightly interested. But they&#8217;ll listen more. Go ahead and tell them.</q></p>

<p>And that was more like it, thought Taine.</p>

<p>That was the kind of language that he could understand.</p>

<p>He settled himself more firmly on the ground and bent forward slightly, flicking his eyes across the three deadpan, ebony faces, trying to make out what they might be thinking.</p>

<p>There was no making out. Those were three of the deadest pans he had ever seen.</p>

<p>It was all familiar. It made him feel at home. He was in his element.</p>

<p>And in the three across from him, he felt somehow subconsciously, he had the best dickering opposition he had ever met. And that made him feel good too.</p>

<p><q>Tell them,</q> he said, <q>that I&#8217;m not quite sure. I may have spoken up too hastily. Paint, after all, is a mighty valuable idea.</q></p>

<p><q>They say, just as a favor to them, not that they&#8217;re really interested, would you tell them a little more.</q></p>

<p>Got them hooked, Taine told himself. If he could only play it right-He settled down to dickering in earnest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hours later Henry Horton showed up. He was accompanied by a very urbane gentleman, who was faultlessly turned out and who carried beneath his arm an impressive attache case.</p>

<p>Henry and the man stopped on the steps in sheer astonishment.</p>

<p>Taine was squatted on the ground with a length of board and he was daubing paint on it while the aliens watched. From the daubs here and there upon their anatomies, it was plain to see the aliens had been doing some daubing of their own. Spread all over the ground were other lengths of half-painted boards and a couple of dozen old cans of paint.</p>

<p>Taine looked up and saw Henry and the man.</p>

<p><q>I was hoping,</q> he said, <q>that someone would show up.</q></p>

<p><q>Hiram,</q> said Henry, with more importance than usual, <q>may I present Mr. Lancaster. He is a special representative of the United Nations.</q></p>

<p><q>I&#8217;m glad to meet you, sir,</q> said Taine. <q>I wonder if you would&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>Mr. Lancaster,</q> Henry explained grandly, <q>was having some slight difficulty getting through the lines outside, so I volunteered my services. I&#8217;ve already explained to him our joint interest in this matter.</q></p>

<p><q>It was very kind of Mr. Horton,</q> Lancaster said. <q>There was this stupid sergeant&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>It&#8217;s all in knowing,</q> Henry said, <q>how to handle people.</q></p>

<p>The remark, Taine noticed, was not appreciated by the man from the U.N.</p>

<p><q>May I inquire, Mr. Taine,</q> asked Lancaster, <q>exactly what you&#8217;re doing?</q></p>

<p><q>I&#8217;m dickering,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p><q>Dickering. What a quaint way of expressing&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>An old Yankee word,</q> said Henry quickly, <q>with certain connotations of its own. When you trade with someone you are exchanging goods, but if you&#8217;re dickering with him you&#8217;re out to get his hide.</q></p>

<p><q>Interesting,</q> said Lancaster. <q>And I suppose you&#8217;re out to skin these gentlemen in the sky-blue vests&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>Hiram,</q> said Henry, proudly, <q>is the sharpest dickerer in these parts. He runs an antique business and he has to dicker hard&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>And may I ask,</q> said Lancaster, ignoring Henry finally, <q>what you might be doing with these cans of paint? Are these gentlemen potential customers for paint or&#8212;</q></p>

<p>Taine threw down the board and rose angrily to his feet.</p>

<p><q>If you&#8217;d both shut up!</q> he shouted. <q>I&#8217;ve been trying to say something ever since you got here and I can&#8217;t get in a word. And I tell you, it&#8217;s important&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>Hiram!</q> Henry exclaimed in horror.</p>

<p><q>It&#8217;s quite all right,</q> said the U.N. man. <q>We <em>have</em> been jabbering. And now, Mr. Taine?</q></p>

<p><q>I&#8217;m backed into a corner,</q> Taine told him, <q>and I need some help. I&#8217;ve sold these fellows on the idea of paint, but I don&#8217;t know a thing about it&#8212;the principle back of it or how it&#8217;s made or what goes into it or-</q></p>

<p><q>But, Mr. Taine, if you&#8217;re selling them the paint, what difference does it make&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>I&#8217;m not selling them the paint,</q> yelled Taine. <q>Can&#8217;t you understand that? They don&#8217;t want the paint. They want the <em>idea</em> of paint, the principle of paint. It&#8217;s something that they never thought of and they&#8217;re interested. I offered them the paint idea for the idea of their saddles and I&#8217;ve almost got it&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>Saddles? You mean those things over there, hanging in the air?</q></p>

<p><q>That is right. Beasly, would you ask one of our friends to demonstrate a saddle?</q></p>

<p><q>You bet I will,</q> said Beasly.</p>

<p><q>What,</q> demanded Henry, <q>has Beasly got to do with this?</q></p>

<p><q>Beasly is an interpreter. I guess you&#8217;d call him a telepath. You remember how he always claimed he could talk with Towser?</q></p>

<p><q>Beasly was always claiming things.</q></p>

<p><q>But this time he was right. He tells Chuck, that funny-looking monster, what I want to say and Chuck tells these aliens. And these aliens tell Chuck and Chuck tells Beasly and Beasly tells me.</q></p>

<p><q>Ridiculous!</q> snorted Henry. <q>Beasly hasn&#8217;t got the sense to be&#8230; what did you say he was?</q></p>

<p><q>A telepath,</q> said Taine.</p>

<p>One of the aliens had gotten up and climbed into a saddle. He rode it forth and back. Then he swung out of it and sat down again.</p>

<p><q>Remarkable,</q> said the U.N. man. <q>Some sort of antigravity unit, with complete control. We could make use of that, indeed.</q></p>

<p>He scraped his hand across his chin.</p>

<p><q>And you&#8217;re going to exchange the idea of paint for the idea of that saddle?</q></p>

<p><q>That&#8217;s exactly it,</q> said Taine, <q>but I need some help. I need a chemist or a paint manufacturer or someone to explain how paint is made. And I need some professor or other who&#8217;ll understand what they&#8217;re talking about when they tell me the idea of the saddle.</q></p>

<p><q>I see,</q> said Lancaster. <q>Yes, indeed, you have a problem. Mr. Taine, you seem to me a man of some discernment&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, he&#8217;s all of that,</q> interrupted Henry. <q>Hiram&#8217;s quite astute.</q></p>

<p><q>So I suppose you&#8217;ll understand,</q> said the U.N. man, <q>that this whole procedure is quite irregular&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>But it&#8217;s not,</q> exploded Taine. <q>That&#8217;s the way they operate. They open up a planet and then they exchange ideas. They&#8217;ve been doing that with other planets for a long, long, time. And ideas are all they want, just the new ideas, because that is the way to keep on building a technology and culture. And they have a lot of ideas, sir, that the human race can use.</q></p>

<p><q>That is just the point,</q> said Lancaster. <q>This is perhaps the most important thing that has ever happened to us humans. In just a short year&#8217;s time we can obtain data and ideas that will put us ahead&#8212;theoretically, at least&#8212;by a thousand years. And in a thing that is so important, we should have experts on the job&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>But,</q> protested Henry, <q>you can&#8217;t find a man who&#8217;ll do a better dickering job than Hiram. When you dicker with him your back teeth aren&#8217;t safe. Why don&#8217;t you leave him be? He&#8217;ll do a job for you. You can get your experts and your planning groups together and let Hiram front for you. These folks have accepted him and have proved they&#8217;ll do business with him and what more do you want? All he needs is a little help.</q></p>

<p>Beasly came over and faced the U.N. man.</p>

<p><q>I won&#8217;t work with no one else,</q> he said. <q>If you kick Hiram out of here, then I go with him. Hiram&#8217;s the only person who ever treated me like a human&#8212;</q></p>

<p><q>There, you see!</q> Henry said, triumphantly.</p>

<p><q>Now, wait a second, Beasly,</q> said the U.N. man. <q>We could make it worth your while. I should imagine that an interpreter in a situation such as this could command a handsome salary.</q></p>

<p><q>Money don&#8217;t mean a thing to me,</q> said Beasly. <q>It won&#8217;t buy me friends. People still will laugh at me.</q></p>

<p><q>He means it, mister,</q> Henry warned. <q>There isn&#8217;t anyone who can be as stubborn as Beasly. I know; he used to work for us.</q></p>

<p>The U.N. man looked flabbergasted and not a little desperate.</p>

<p><q>It will take you quite some time,</q> Henry pointed out, <q>to find another telepath&#8212;leastwise one who can talk to these people here.</q></p>

<p>The U.N. man looked as if he were strangling. <q>I doubt,</q> he said, <q>there&#8217;s another one on Earth.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, all right,</q> said Beasly, brutally, <q>let&#8217;s make up our minds. I ain&#8217;t standing here all day.</q></p>

<p><q>All right,</q> cried the U.N. man. <q>You two go ahead. Please, will you go ahead? This is a chance we can&#8217;t let slip through our fingers. Is there anything you want? Anything I can do for you?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, there is,</q> said Taine. <q>There&#8217;ll be the boys from Washington and bigwigs from other countries. Just keep them off my back.</q></p>

<p><q>I&#8217;ll explain most carefully to everyone. There&#8217;ll be no interference.</q></p>

<p><q>And I need that chemist and someone who&#8217;ll know about the saddles. And I need them quick. I can stall these boys a little longer, but not for too much longer.</q></p>

<p><q>Anyone you need,</q> said the U.N. man. <q>Anyone at all. I&#8217;ll have them here in hours. And in a day or two there&#8217;ll be a pool of experts waiting for whenever you may need them&#8212;on a moment&#8217;s notice.</q></p>

<p><q>Sir,</q> said Henry, unctuously, <q>that&#8217;s most co-operative. Both Hiram and I appreciate it greatly. And now, since this is settled, I understand that there are reporters waiting. They&#8217;ll be interested in your statement.</q></p>

<p>The U.N. man, it seemed, didn&#8217;t have it in him to protest. He and Henry went tramping up the stairs.</p>

<p>Taine turned around and looked out across the desert.</p>

<p><q>It&#8217;s a big front yard,</q> he said.</p>
