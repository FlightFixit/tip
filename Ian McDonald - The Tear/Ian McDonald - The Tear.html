<h3 class="small-caps">Ptey, Sailing</h3>

<p>On the night that Ptey voyaged out to have his soul shattered, eight hundred stars set sail across the sky. It was an evening at Great Winter's ending. The sunlit hours raced toward High Summer, each day lavishly more full of light than the one before. In this latitude, the sun hardly set at all after the spring equinox, rolling along the horizon, fat and idle and pleased with itself. Summer-born Ptey turned his face to the sun as it dipped briefly beneath the horizon, closed his eyes, enjoyed its lingering warmth on his eyelids, in the angle of his cheekbones, on his lips. To the Summer-born, any loss of the light was a reminder of the terrible, sad months of winter and the unbroken, encircling dark.</p>

<p><em>But we have the stars</em>, his father said, a Winter-born. <em>We are born looking out into the universe.</em></p>

<p>Ptey's father commanded the little machines that ran the catamaran, trimming sail, winding sheets, setting course by the tumble of satellites; but the tiller he held himself. The equinoctial gales had spun away to the west two weeks before and the catboat ran fast and fresh on a sweet wind across the darkening water. Twin hulls cut through the ripple-reflections of gas flares from the Temejveri oil platforms. As the sun slipped beneath the huge dark horizon and the warmth fell from the hollows of Ptey's face, so his father turned his face to the sky. Tonight, he wore his Steris Aspect. The ritual selves scared Ptey, so rarely were they unfurled in Ctarisphay: births, namings, betrothals and marriages, divorces and deaths. And of course, the Mani-foldings. Familiar faces became distant and formal. Their language changed, their bodies seemed slower, heavier. They became possessed by strange, special knowledges. Only Steris possessed the language for the robots to sail the catamaran and, despite the wheel of positioning satellites around tilted Tay, the latitude and longitude of the Manifold House. The catamaran itself was only run out from its boathouse, to strong songs heavy with clashing harmonies, when a child from Ctarisphay on the edge of adulthood sailed out beyond the outer mole and the fleet of oil platforms to have his or her personality unfolded into eight.</p>

<p>Only two months since, Cjatay had sailed out into the oily black of a late winter afternoon. Ptey was Summer-born, a Solstice boy; Cjatay a late Autumn. It was considered remarkable that they shared enough in common to be able to speak to each other, let alone become the howling boys of the neighborhood, the source of every broken window and borrowed boat. The best part of three seasons between them, but here was only two moons later, leaving behind the pulsing gas flares and maze of pipe work of the sheltering oil fields, heading into the great, gentle oceanic glow of the plankton blooms, steering by the stars, the occupied, haunted stars. The Manifolding was never a thing of moons and calendars, but of mothers' watchings and grandmothers' knowings and teachers' notings and fathers' murmurings, of subtly shifted razors and untimely lethargies, of deep-swinging voices and stained bedsheets.</p>

<p>On Etjay Quay, where the porcelain houses leaned over the landing, Ptey had thrown his friend's bag down into the boat. Cjatay's father had caught it and frowned. There were observances. Ways. Forms.</p>

<p><q>See you,</q> Ptey had said.</p>

<p><q>See you.</q> Then the wind caught in the catamaran's tall, curved sails, and carried it away from the rain-wet, shiny faces of the houses of Ctarisphay. Ptey had watched the boat until it was lost in the light dapple of the city's lamps on the winter-dark water. See Cjatay he would, after his six months on the Manifold House. But only partially. There would be Cjatays he had never known, never even met. Eight of them, and the Cjatay with whom he had stayed out all the brief Low Summer nights of the prith run on the fishing staithes, skinny as the piers' wooden legs silhouetted against the huge sun kissing the edge of the world, would be but a part, a dream of one of the new names and new personalities. Would he know him when he met him on the great floating university that was the Manifold House?</p>

<p>Would he know himself?</p>

<p><q>Are they moving yet?</q> Steris called from the tiller. Ptey shielded his dark-accustomed eyes against the pervasive glow of the carbon-absorbing plankton blooms and peered into the sky. <em>Sail of Bright Anticipation</em> cut two lines of liquid black through the gently undulating sheet of biolight, fraying at the edges into fractal curls of luminescence as the sheets of microorganisms sought each other.</p>

<p><q>Nothing yet.</q></p>

<p>But it would be soon, and it would be tremendous. Eight hundred stars setting out across the night. Through the changes and domestic rituals of his sudden Manifolding, Ptey had been aware of sky-watch parties being arranged, star-gazing groups setting up telescopes along the quays and in the campaniles, while day on day the story moved closer to the head of the news. Half the world-that half of the world not blinded by its extravagant axial tilt-would be looking to the sky. Watching Steris rig <em>Sail of Bright Anticipation</em>, Ptey had felt cheated, like a sick child confined to bed while festival raged across the boats lashed beneath his window. Now, as the swell of the deep dark of his world's girdling ocean lifted the twin prows of <em>Sail of Bright Anticipation</em>, on his web of shock-plastic mesh ahead of the mast, Ptey felt his excitement lift with it. A carpet of lights below, a sky of stars above: all his alone.</p>

<p>They were not stars. They were the eight hundred and twenty-six space habitats of the Anpreen Commonweal, spheres of nanocarbon ice and water five hundred kilometers in diameter that for twice Ptey's lifetime had adorned Bephis, the ringed gas giant, like a necklace of pearls hidden in a velvet bag, far from eye and mind. The negotiations fell into eras. The Panic; when the world of Tay became aware that the gravity waves pulsing through the huge ripple tank that was their ocean-bound planet were the bow-shocks of massive artifacts decelerating from near lightspeed. The Denial, when Tay's governments decided it was Best Really to try to hide the fact that their solar system had been immigrated into by eight hundred and some space vehicles, each larger than Tay's petty moons, falling into neat and proper order around Bephis. The Soliciting, when it became obvious that Denial was futile-but on our terms, our terms. A fleet of space probes was dispatched to survey and attempt radio contact with the arrivals-as yet silent as ice. And, when they were not blasted from space or vaporized or collapsed into quantum black holes or any of the plethora of fanciful destructions imagined in the popular media, the Overture. The Sobering, when it was realized that these star-visitors existed primarily as swarms of free-swimming nanoassemblers in the free-fall spherical oceans of their eight hundred and some habitats, one mind with many forms; and, for the Anpreen, the surprise that these archaic hominiforms on this backwater planet were many selves within one body. One thing they shared and understood well. Water. It ran through their histories, it flowed around their ecologies, it mediated their molecules. After one hundred and twelve years of near-lightspeed flight, the Anpreen Commonweal was desperately short of water; their spherical oceans shriveled almost into zero gravity teardrops within the immense, nanotech-reinforced ice shells. Then began the era of Negotiation, the most prolonged of the phases of contact, and the most complex. It had taken three years to establish the philosophical foundations: the Anpreen, an ancient species of the great Clade, had long been a colonial mind, arranged in subtle hierarchies of self-knowledge and ability, and did not know whom to talk to, whom to ask for a decision, in a political system with as many governments and nations as there were islands and archipelagos scattered across the world ocean of the fourth planet from the sun.</p>

<p>Now the era of Negotiation had become the era of Open Trade. The Anpreen habitats spent their last drops of reaction mass to break orbit around Bephis and move the Commonweal in-system. Their destination was not Tay, but Tejaphay, Tay's sunward neighbor, a huge waterworld of unbroken ocean one hundred kilometers deep, crushing gravity, and endless storms.</p>

A billion years before the seed ships probed the remote star system,
the gravitational interplay of giant worlds had sent the least of their
number spiraling sunward. Solar wind had stripped away its huge
atmosphere and melted its mantle of water ice into a planetary ocean,
deep and dark as nightmares. It was that wink of water in the
system-scale interferometers of the Can-Bet-Merey people, half a
million years before, that had inspired them to fill their night sky
with solar sails as one hundred thousand slow seed ships rode out on
flickering launch lasers toward the new system. An evangelically
pro-life people were the Can-Bet-Merey, zealous for the Clade's
implicit dogma that intelligence was the only force in the universe
capable of defeating the physical death of space-time.
<p>If the tens of thousand of biological packages they had rained into the world-ocean of Tejaphay had germinated life, Tay's probes had yet to discover it. The Can-Bet-Merey did strike roots in the afterthought, that little blue pearl next out from the sun, a tear spun from huge Tejaphay.</p>

<p>One hundred thousand years ago, the Can-Bet-Merey had entered the postbiological phase of intelligence and moved to that level that could no longer communicate with the biological life of Tay, or even the Anpreen.</p>

<p><q>Can you see anything yet?</q> A call from the tiller. <em>Sail of Bright Anticipation</em> had left behind the carbon-soaked plankton bloom; the ocean was deep dark and boundless. Sky and sea blurred; stars became confused with the riding lights of ships close on the horizon.</p>

<p><q>Is it time?</q> Ptey called back.</p>

<p><q>Five minutes ago.</q></p>

<p>Ptey found a footing on the webbing and, one hand wrapped in the sheets, stood up to scan the huge sky. Every child of Tay, crazily tilted at forty-eight degrees to the ecliptic, grew up conscious that her planet was a ball rolling around the sun and that the stars were far, vast and slow, almost unchanging. But stars could change; Bephis, that soft smudge of light low in the southeast, blurred by the glow of eight hundred moon-sized space habitats, would soon be once again the hard point of light by which his ancestors had steered to their Mani-foldings.</p>

<p><q>Give it time,</q> Ptey shouted. Time. The Anpreen were already voyaging; had switched on their drives and pulled out of orbit almost an hour before. The slow light of their embarkation had still not reached Tay. He saw the numbers spinning around in his head, accelerations, vectors, space and time all arranged around him like fluttering carnival banners. It had taken Ptey a long time to understand that not everyone could see numbers like him and reach out and make them do what they wanted.</p>

<p><q>Well, I'll be watching the football,</q> Cjatay had declared when Teacher Deu had declared a special class project in conjunction with the Noble Observatory of Pteu to celebrate the Anpreen migration.
<q>We're all jumping up and down, Anpreen this, Anpreen that, but when it
comes down to it, the aliens and we don't know what they really want;
no one does.</q></p>

<p><q>They're not aliens,</q> Ptey had hissed back. <q>There <em>are</em> no aliens, don't you know that? We're all just part of the one big Clade.</q></p>

<p>Then Teacher Deu had shouted at them, Quiet you boys, and they had straightened themselves at their kneeling-desks, but Cjatay had hissed,
<q>So if they're our cousins, why don't they give us their star-crosser
drive?</q></p>

<p>Such was the friendship between Ptey and Cjatay that they would argue over nodes of free-swimming nanotechnology orbiting a gas giant.</p>

<p><q>Look! Oh look!</q></p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, Bephis was unraveling into a glowing smudge, like one of the swarms of nuchpas that hung above the waves like smoke on High Summer mornings. The fleet was moving. Eight hundred worlds. The numbers in his skull told Ptey that the Anpreen Commonweal was already at ten percent of lightspeed. He tried to work out the relativistic deformations of space-time but there were too many numbers flocking around him too fast. Instead, he watched Bephis unfurl into a galaxy, that cloud of stars slowly pull away from the bright mote of the gas giant. Crossing the ocean of night. Ptey glanced behind him. In the big dark, his father's face was hard to read, especially as Steris, who was sober and focused, and, Ptey had learned, not particularly bright. He seemed to be smiling.</p>

<p>It is a deep understanding, the realization that you are cleverer than your parents, Ptey thought. Behind that first smirking, satisfied sense of your own smartness comes a more profound understanding; that smart is only smart at some things, in some situations. Clever is conditional: Ptey could calculate the space-time distortion of eight hundred space habitats, plot a course across the dark, steepening sea by the stars in their courses, but he could never harness the winds or whistle the small commands to the machines, all the weather-clevernesses of Steris. That is how our world has shaped our intelligences. A self for every season.</p>

<p>The ravel of stars was unwinding, the Anpreen migration flowing into a ribbon of sparkles, a scarf of night beyond the veils of the aurora. Tomorrow night, it would adorn Tejaphay, that great blue guide star on the edge of the world that had become a glowing smudge, a thumbprint of the alien. Tomorrow night, Ptey would look at that blue eye in the sky from the minarets of the Manifold House. He knew that it had minarets; every child knew what the Manifold House and its sister houses all around the world looked like. Great hulks of gray wood gone silvery from salt and sun, built over upon through within alongside until they were floating cities. Cities of children. But the popular imaginations of Teacher Deu's grade eight class never painted them bright and loud with voices; they were dark, sooty labyrinths sailing under a perpetual cloud of black diesel smoke that poured from a thousand chimneys, taller even than the masts and towers. The images were sharp in Ptey's mind, but he could never see himself there, in those winding wooden staircases loud with the cries of sea birds, looking out from the high balconies across the glowing sea.</p>

<p>Then his breath caught. All his imaginings and failures to imagine were made true as lights disentangled themselves from the skein of stars of the Anpreen migration: red and green stars, the riding lights of the Manifold House. Now he could feel the thrum of its engines and generators through the water and the twin hulls. Ptey set his hand to the carbon nanofiber mast. It sang to deep harmonic. And just as the stars are always further than you think, so Ptey saw that the lights of the Manifold House were closer than he thought, that he was right under them, that <em>Sail of Bright Anticipation</em> was slipping through the outer buoys and nets, and that the towers and spires and minarets, rising in his vision, one by one, were obliterating the stars.</p>

<h3 class="small-caps">Nejben, Swimming</h3>

<p>Beneath a sky of honey, Nejben stood hip deep in water warm as blood, deep as forgetting. This High Summer midnight, the sun was still clear from the horizon, and in its constant heat and light, the wood of the Manifold House's old, warped spires seemed to exhale a spicy musk, the distilled pheromone of centuries of teenage hormones and sexual angsts and identity crises. In cupped hands, Nejben scooped up the waters of the Chalybeate Pool and let them run, gold and thick, through his fingers. He savored the sensuality, observed the flash of sunlight through the falling water, noted the cool, deep plash as the pool received its own. A new Aspect, Nejben; old in observation and knowledge, for the body remained the same though a flock of selves came to roost in it, fresh in interpretation and experience.</p>

<p>When Nejben first emerged, shivering and anoxic, from the Chalybeate Pool, to be wrapped in silvery thermal sheets by the agisters, he had feared himself mad. A voice in his head that would not go away, that would not be shut up, that seemed to know him, know every part of him.</p>

<p><q>It's perfectly normal,</q> said agister Ashbey, a plump, serious woman with the blackest skin Nejben had ever seen. But he remembered that every Ritual Aspect was serious, and in the Manifold House the agisters were never in any other Aspect. None that the novices would ever see.
<q>Perfectly natural. It takes time for your Prior, your childhood
Aspect, to find its place and relinquish the control of the higher
cognitive levels. Give it time. Talk to him. Reassure him. He will feel
very lost, very alone, like he has lost everything that he ever knew.
Except you, Nejben.</q></p>

<p>The time-free, sun-filled days in the sunny, smoggy yards and cloisters of the First Novitiate were full of whisperings; boys and girls like himself whispering good-bye to their childhoods. Nejben learned his Prior's dreads, that the self that had been called Ptey feared that the numbers, the patterns between them, the ability to reduce physical objects to mathematics and see in an instant their relationships and implications, would be utterly lost. He saw also that Nejben in himself scared Ptey: the easy physicality, the unselfconscious interest in his own body, the awareness of the hormones pumping like tidewater through his tubes and cells; the ever-present, ever-tickling nag of sex; everywhere, everywhen, everyone and -thing. Even as a child-self, even as shadow, Ptey knew that the first self to be birthed at the Manifold House was the pubescent self, the sexual self, but he felt this growing, aching youth to be more alien than the disembodied, mathematical Anpreen.</p>

<p>The tiers led down into the palp pool. In its depths, translucencies shifted. Nejben shivered in the warm High Summer midnight.</p>

<p><q>Hey! Ptey!</q></p>

<p>Names flocked around the Manifold House's towers like sun-gulls. New selves, new identities unfolded every hour of every day and yet old names clung. Agister Ashbey, jokey and astute, taught the social subtleties by which adults knew what Aspect and name to address and which Aspect and name of their own to wear in response. From the shade of the Poljeri Cloister, Puzhay waved. Ptey had found girls frightening, but Nejben liked them, enjoyed their company and the little games of admiring insult and flirting mock-animosity he played with them. He reckoned he understood girls now. Puzhay was small, still boy-figured, her skin Winter-born pale, ajanni from Be-denderay, where at midwinter the atmosphere froze. She had a barbarous accent and continental manners, but Nejben found himself thinking often about her small, flat boy-breasts with their big, thumbable nipples. He had never thought when he came to the Manifold House that there would be people here from places other than Ctarisphay and its archipelago sisters. People-girls-from the big polar continent. Rude girls who cursed and openly called boys' names.</p>

<p><q>Puzhay! What're you doing?</q></p>

<p><q>Going in.</q></p>

<p><q>For the palps?</q></p>

<p><q>Nah. Just going in.</q></p>

<p>Nejben found and enjoyed a sudden, swift swelling of his dick as he watched Puzhay's breasts tauten as she raised her arms above her head and dived, awkward as a Bedenderay land-girl, into the water. Water hid it. Sun dapple kept it secret. Then he felt a shiver run over him and he dived down, deep down. He almost let the air rush out of him in a gasp as he felt the cool, cool water close around his body; then he saw Puzhay in her tight swim-shorts that made her ass look so strong and muscley turn in the water, tiny bubbles leaking from her nose, to grin and wave and beckon him down. Nejben swam down past the descending tiers of steps. Green opened before him, the bottomless emerald beyond the anti-skray nets where the Chalybeate pond was refreshed by the borderless sea. Between her pale red body and the deep green sea were the shimmering curtains of the palps.</p>

<p><em>They did not make them we did not bring them they were here forever.</em> Ten thousand years of theology, biology, and xenology in that simple kinder-group rhyme. Nejben-all his people-had always known their special place; stranger to this world, spurted into the womb of the world-sea as the star-sperm, the seed of sentience. Twenty million drops of life-seed swam ashore and became humanity; the rest swam out to sea and met and smelled and loved the palps, older than forever. Now Nejben turned and twisted like an eel past funny, flirting, heartbreaking Puzhay, turning to show the merest glimpse of his own sperm-eel, down toward the palps. The curtain of living jelly rippled and dissolved into their separate lives. Slick, cold, quivering jelly slid across his sex-warm flesh. Nejben shivered, quivered; repelled yet aroused in a way that was other than sex. The water took on a prickle, a tickle, a tang of salt and fear and ancient, ancient lusts, deep as his first stiff dream. Against sense, against reason, against three million years of species wisdom, Nejben employed the tricks of agister Ashbey and opened his mouth. He inhaled. Once he gagged, twice he choked, then he felt the jellied eeling of the palps squirm down his throat: a choke, and into the lungs. He inhaled green salt water. And then, as the palps demurely unraveled their nanotube outer integuments and infiltrated them into his lungs, his bronchial tubes, his bloodstream, he <em>became.</em> Memories stirred, invoked by olfactory summonings, changed as a new voice, a new way of seeing, a new interpretation of those memories and experiences, formed. Nejben swam down, breathing memory-water, stroke by stroke unraveling. There was another down there, far below him, swimming up not through water but through the twelve years of his life. A new self.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Puzhay, against the light of a three o'clock sky. Framed in the arch of a cell window, knees pulled up to her chest. Small budding breasts; strong, boy jawline, fall and arc of hair shadow against lilac. She had laughed, throwing her head back. That first sight of her was cut into Nejben's memory, every line and trace, like the paper silhouettes the limners would cut of friends and families and enemies for Autumn Solstice. That first stirring of sex, that first intimation in the self of Ptey of this then-stranger, now-familiar Nejben.</p>

<p>As soon as he could, he had run. After he had found out where to put his bag, after he had worked out how to use the ancient, gurgling shit-eater, after agister Ashbey had closed the door with a smile and a blessing on the wooden cell&mdash;his wooden cell&mdash;that still smelled of fresh-cut timber after hundreds of years on the world-ocean of Tay. In the short season in which photosynthesis was possible, Bedenderay's forests grew fast and fierce, putting on meters in a single day. Small wonder the wood still smelled fresh and lively. After the midnight walk along the ceramic lanes and up the wooden staircases and through the damp-smelling cloisters, through the gently undulating quadrangles with the sky-train of the Anpreen migration bright overhead, holding on, as tradition demanded, to the bell hung by a chain from his agister's waist; after the form filling and the photographings and the registering and the this-is-your-ident-card this is your map I've tattooed onto the back of your hand trust it will guide you and I am your agister and we'll see you in the east Refectory for breakfast; after the climb up the slimy wooden stairs from <em>Sail of Bright Anticipation</em> on to the Manifold House's quay, the biolights green around him and the greater lamps of the great college's towers high before him; when he was alone in this alien new world where he would become eight alien new people: he ran.</p>

<p>Agister Ashbey was faithful; the tattoo, a clever print of smart molecules and nanodyes, was meshed into the Manifold House's network and guided him through the labyrinth of dormitories and cloisters and Boys' Pavilions and Girlhearths by the simple, aversive trick of stinging the opposite side of his map-hand to the direction in which he was to turn.</p>

<p>Cjatay. Sea-sundered friend. The only other one who knew him, knew him the moment they had met outside the school walls and recognized each other as different from the sailing freaks and fishing fools. Interested in geography, in love with numbers, with the wonder of the world and the worlds, as the city net declared, beyond. Boys who looked up at the sky</p>

<p>As his burning hand led him left, right, up this spiral staircase under the lightening sky, such was Ptey's impetus that he never thought, would he know Cjatay? Cjatay had been in the Manifold House three months. Cjatay could be&mdash;<em>would</em> be&mdash;any number of Aspects now. Ptey had grown up with his father's overlapping circles of friends, each specific to a different Aspect, but he had assumed that it was a grown-up thing. That couldn't happen to him and Cjatay! Not them.</p>

<p>The cell was one of four that opened off a narrow oval at the head of a tulip-shaped minaret&mdash;the Third Moon of Spring Tower, the legend on the back of Ptey's hand read. Cells were assigned by birth-date and season. Head and heart full of nothing but seeing Cjatay, he pushed open the door&mdash;no door in the Manifold House was ever locked.</p>

<p>She was in the arched window, dangerously high above the shingled roofs and porcelain domes of the Vernal Equinox division. Beyond her, only the wandering stars of the Anpreen. Ptey had no name for the sudden rush of feelings that came when he saw Puzhay throw back her head and laugh at some so-serious comment of Cjatay's. Nejben did.</p>

<p>It was only at introductory breakfast in the East Refectory, where he met the other uncertain, awkward boys and girls of his intake, that Ptey saw past the dawn seduction of Puzhay to Cjatay, and saw him unchanged, exactly as he had been when he had stepped down from Etjay Quay into the catamaran and been taken out across the lagoon to the waste gas flares of Temejveri.</p>

<hr/>

<p>She was waiting crouched on the wooden steps where the water of the Chalybeate Pool lapped, knees pulled to her chest, goose flesh pimpling her forearms and calves in the cool of after-midnight. He knew this girl, knew her name, knew her history, knew the taste of a small, tentative kiss stolen among the crowds of teenagers pushing over Twelfth Canal Bridge. The memory was sharp and warm, but it was another's.</p>

<p><q>Hi there.</q></p>

<p>He dragged himself out of the water onto the silvery wood, rolled away to hide his nakedness. In the cloister shadow, Ash-bey waited with a sea-silk robe.</p>

<p><q>Hi there.</q> There was never any easy way to tell someone you were another person from the one they remembered. <q>I'm Serejen.</q> The name had been there, down among the palps, slipped into him with their mind-altering neurotransmitters.</p>

<p><q>Are you?</q></p>

<p><q>All right. Yes, I'm all right.</q> A tickle in the throat made him cough, the cough amplified into a deep retch. Serejen choked up a lungful of mucus-stained palp jelly. In the early light, it thinned and ran, flowed down the steps to rejoin its shoal in the Chalybeate Pool. Agister Ashbey took a step forward. Serejen waved her away.</p>

<p><q>What time is it?</q></p>

<p><q>Four thirty.</q></p>

<p>Almost five hours.</p>

<p><q>Serejen.</q> Puzhay looked coyly away. Around the Chalybeate Pool, other soul-swimmers were emerging, coughing up lungfuls of palp, shivering in their thermal robes, growing into new Aspects of themselves. <q>It's Cjatay. He needs to see you. Dead urgent.</q></p>

<p>Waiting Ashbey folded newborn Serejen in his own thermal gown, the intelligent plastics releasing their stored heat to his particular body temperature.</p>

<p><q>Go to him,</q> his agister said.</p>

<p><q>I thought I was supposed to&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>You've got the rest of your life to get to know Serejen. I think you should go.</q></p>

<p>Cjatay. A memory of fascination with starry skies, counting and numbering and betting games. The name and the face belonged to another Aspect, another life, but that old lust for numbers, for discovering the relationships between things, stirred a deep welling of joy. It was as rich and adult as the swelling of his dick he found in the bright mornings, or when he thought about Puzhay's breasts in his hands and the tattooed triangle of her sex. Different; no less intense.</p>

<p>The shutters were pulled close. The screen was the sole light in the room. Cjatay turned on hearing his lockless door open. He squinted into the gloom of the stair head, then cried excitedly, <q>Look at this look at this!</q></p>

<p>Pictures from the observation platforms sent to Tejaphay to monitor the doings of the Anpreen. A black-light plane of stars, the blinding blue curve of the water world stopped down to prevent screen-burn. The closer habitats showed a disk, otherwise it was moving lights. Patterns of speed and gravity.</p>

<p><q>What am I looking at?</q></p>

<p><q>Look look, they're building a space elevator! I wondered how they were going to get the water from Tejaphay. Simple, duh! They're just going to vacuum it up! They've got some kind of processing unit in stationary orbit chewing up one of those asteroids they brought with them, but they're using one of their own habitats to anchor it.</q></p>

<p><q>At twice stationary orbit,</q> Serejen said. <q>So they're going to have to build down and up at the same time to keep the elevator in tension.</q> He did not know where the words came from. They were on his lips and they were true.</p>

<p><q>It must be some kind of nanocarbon compound,</q> Cjatay said, peering at the screen for some hint, some elongation, some erection from the fuzzy blob of the construction asteroid. <q>Incredible tensile strength, yet very flexible. We have to get that; with all our oil, it could change everything about our technology. It could really make us a proper star-faring people.</q> Then, as if hearing truly for the first time, Cjatay turned from the screen and peered again at the figure in the doorway. <q>Who are you?</q> His voice was high and soft and plaintive.</p>

<p><q>I'm Serejen.</q></p>

<p><q>You sound like Ptey.</q></p>

<p><q>I was Ptey. I remember him.</q></p>

<p>Cjatay did a thing with his mouth, a twisting, chewing movement that Serejen recalled from moments of unhappiness and frustration. The time at his sister's name day party, when all the birth family was gathered and he had shown how it was almost certain that someone in the house on Drunken Chicken Lane had the same name day as little Sezjma. There had been a long, embarrassed silence as Cjatay had burst into the adult chatter. Then laughter. And again, when Cjatay had worked out how long it would take to walk a light-year and Teacher Deu has asked the class,
<em>Does anyone understand this?</em> For a moment, Serejen thought
that me boy might cry. That would have been a terrible thing: unseemly,
humiliating. Then he saw the bag on the unkempt bed, the ritual white
clothes thrust knotted and fighting into it.</p>

<p><q>I think what Cjatay wants to say is that he's leaving the Manifold House,</q> agister Ashbey said, in the voice that Serejen understood as the one adults used when they had uncomfortable things to say. In that voice was a hidden word that Ashbey would not, that Serejen and Puzhay could not, and that Cjatay never would speak.</p>

<p>There was one in every town, every district. Kentlay had lived at the bottom of Drunken Chicken Lane, still at forty-something living with his birth parents. He had never married, though then&mdash;Ptey had heard that some did, and not just others like them. Normals. Multiples. Kentlay had been a figure that drew pity and respect alike; equally blessed and cursed, the Lonely were granted insights and gifts in compensation for their inability to manifold into the Eight Aspects. Kentlay had the touch for skin diseases, warts, and the sicknesses of birds. Ptey had been sent to see him for the charm of a dangling wart on his chin. The wart was gone within a week. Even then, Ptey had wondered if it had been through unnatural gifts or superstitious fear of the alien at the end of the wharf.</p>

<p>Cjatay. Lonely. The words were as impossible together as <em>green sun</em> or <em>bright winter.</em> It was never to be like this. Though the waters of the Chalybeate Pool would break them into many brilliant shards, though there would be other lives, other friends, even other wives and husbands, there would always be aspects of themselves that remembered trying to draw birds and fishes on the glowing band of the Mid Winter Galaxy that hung in the sky for weeks on end, or trying to calculate the mathematics of the High Summer silverlings that shoaled like silver needles in the Lagoon, how they kept together yet apart, how they were many but moved as one. <em>Boiling rain. Summer ice. A morning where the sun wouldn't rise. A friend who would always, only be one person.</em> Impossibilities. Cjatay could not be abnormal. Dark word. A vile word that hung on Cjatay like an oil-stained tarpaulin.</p>

<p>He sealed his bag and slung it over his shoulder.</p>

<p><q>I'll give you a call when you get back.</q></p>

<p><q>Yeah. Okay. That would be good.</q> Words and needs and sayings flocked to him, but the end was so fast, so sudden, that all Serejen could do was stare at his feet so that he would not have to see Cjatay walk away. Puzhay was in tears. Cjatay's own agister, a tall, dark-skinned Summer-born, put his arm around Cjatay and took him to the stairs.</p>

<p><q>Hey. Did you ever think?</q> Cjatay threw back the line from the top of the spiral stair. <q>Why are they here? The Anpreen.</q> Even now, Serejen realized, Cjatay was hiding from the truth that he would be marked as different, as not fully human, for the rest of his life, hiding behind stars and ships and the mystery of the alien. <q>Why did they come here? They call it the Anpreen Migration, but where are they migrating <em>to?</em> And what are they migrating <em>from?</em> Anyone ever ask that? Ever think about that, eh?</q></p>

<p>Then agister Ashbey closed the door on the high tower-top cell.</p>

<p><q>We'll talk later.</q></p>

<p>Gulls screamed. Change in the weather coming. On the screen behind him, stars moved across the face of the great water.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Serejen could not bear to go down to the quay, but watched <em>Sail of Bright Anticipation</em> make sail from the cupola of the Bright Glance Netball Hall. The Manifold House was sailing through a plankton-bloom and he watched the ritual catamaran's hulls cut two lines of bioglow through the carpet of carbon-absorbing microlife. He stood and followed the sails until they were lost among the hulls of huge ceramic oil tankers pressed low to the orange smog-glow of Ctarisphay down under the horizon. Call each other. They would always forget to do that. They would slip out of each other's lives&mdash;Serejen's life now vastly more rich and populous as he moved across the social worlds of his various Aspects. In time, they would slip out of each other's thoughts and memories. So it was that Serejen Nejben ex-Ptey knew that he was not a child any longer. He could let things go. After morning Shift class, Serejen went down to the Old Great Pool, the ancient flooded piazza that was the historic heart of the Manifold House, and used the techniques he had learned an hour before to effortlessly transfer from Serejen to Nejben. Then he went down into the waters and swam with Puzhay. She was teary and confused, but the summer-warmed water and the physical exercise brightened her. Under a sky lowering with the summer storm that the gulls had promised, they sought out the many secret flooded colonnades and courts where the big groups of friends did not go. There, under the first crackles of lightning and the hiss of rain, he kissed her and she slipped her hand into his swimsuit and cradled the comfortable swell of his cock.</p>

<h3 class="small-caps">Serejen, Loving</h3>

<p>Night, the aurora and sirens. Serejen shivered as police drones came in low over the Conservatorium roof. Through the high, arched windows, fires could still be seen burning on Yaskaray Prospect. The power had not yet been restored, the streets, the towering apartment blocks that lined them, were still dark. A stalled tram sprawled across a set of points, flames flickering in its rear carriage. The noise of the protest had moved off, but occasional shadows moved across the ice beneath the mesmerism of the aurora; student rioters, police security robots. It was easy to tell the robots by the sprays of ice crystals thrown up by their needle-tip, mincing legs.</p>

<p><q>Are you still at that window? Come away from there. If they see you they might shoot you. Look, I've made tea.</q></p>

<p><q>Who?</q></p>

<p><q>What?</q></p>

<p><q>Who might shoot me? The rioters or the police?</q></p>

<p><q>Like you'd care if you were dead.</q></p>

<p>But he came and sat at the table and took the bowl of thin, salty Bedenderay mate.</p>

<p><q>But sure I can't be killed.</q></p>

<p>Her name was Seriantep. She was an Anpreen Prebendary ostensibly attached to the College of Theoretical Physics at the Conservatorium of Jann. She looked like a tall, slim young woman with the dark skin and blue-black hair of a Summer-born Archipelagan, but that was just the form that the swarm of Anpreen nanoprocessor motes had assumed. She hived. Reris Orhum Fejannen Kekjay Prus Rejmer Serejen Nejben wondered how close you had to get before her perfect skin resolved into a blur of microscopic motes. He had had much opportunity to make this observation. As well as being his notional student&mdash;though what a functionally immortal hive-citizen who had crossed one hundred and twenty light-years could learn from a fresh twentysomething meat human was moot&mdash;she was his occasional lover.</p>

<p>She drank the tea. Serejen watched the purse of her lips around the delicate porcelain bowl decorated with the ubiquitous Lord of the Fishes motif, even in high, dry continental Jann. The small movement of her throat as she swallowed. He knew a hundred such tiny, intimate movements, but even as she cooed and giggled and gasped to the stimulations of the Five Leaves, Five Fishes ritual, the involuntary actions of her body had seemed like performances. Learned responses. Performances as he made observations. Actor and audience. That was the kind of lover he was as Serejen.</p>

<p><q>So what is it really like to fuck a pile of nanomotes?</q> Puzhay had asked as they rolled around with wine in the cozy warm fleshiness of the Thirteenth Window Coupling Porch at the ancient, academic Ogrun Menholding. <q>I'd imagine it feels&hellip; fizzy.</q> And she'd squeezed his cock, holding it hostage, <em>Watch what you say boy.</em></p>

<p><q>At least nanomotes never get morning breath,</q> he'd said, and she'd given a little shriek of outrage and jerked his dick so that he yelped, and then they both laughed and then rolled over again and buried themselves deep into the winter&mdash;defying warmth of the piled quilts.</p>

<p><em>I should be with her now</em>, he thought. The months-long winter nights beneath the aurora and the stars clouds of the great galaxy were theirs. After the Manifold House, he had gone with her to her Bedenderay and her home city of Jann. The City Conservatorium had the world's best theoretical physics department. It was nothing to do with small, boyish, funny Puzhay. They had formalized a partnering six months later. His parents had complained and shivered through all the celebrations in this cold and dark and barbarous city far from the soft elegance of island life. But ever after, winter&mdash;even on the coldest mornings when carbon dioxide frost crusted the steps of the Tea Lane Ladyhearth where Puzhay lived&mdash;was their season. He should call her, let her know he was still trapped but that at the first sign, the very first sign, he would come back. The cell net was still up. Even an e-mail. He couldn't. Seriantep didn't know. Seriantep wouldn't understand. She had not understood that one time when he tried to explain it in abstracts; that different Aspects could-should-have different relationships with different partners, love separately but equally. <em>That as Serejen, I love you, Anpreen Prebendary Seriantep, but as Nejben, I love Puzhay.</em> He could never say that. For an immortal, star-crossing hive of nanomotes, Seriantep was very single-minded.</p>

<p>Gunfire cracked in the crystal night, far and flat.</p>

<p><q>I think it's dying down,</q> Seriantep said.</p>

<p><q>I'd give it a while yet.</q></p>

<p>So strange, so rude, this sudden flaring of anti-alien violence. In the dreadful dead of winter, too, when nothing should rightfully fight and even the trees along Yaskaray Prospect drew down to their heartwood and turned to ice. Despite the joy of Puzhay, Serejen knew that he would always hate the Bedenderay winter. <em>You watch out now</em>, his mother had said when he had announced his decision to go to Jann. <em>They all go dark-mad there.</em> Accidie and suicide walked the frozen canals of the Winter City. No surprise then that madness should break out against the Anpreen Prebendaries. Likewise inevitable that the popular rage should be turned against the Conservatorium. The university had always been seen as a place apart from the rest of Jann, in summer aloof and lofty above the sweltering streets, like an overgrand daughter; in winter a parasite on this most marginal of economies. Now it was the unofficial alien embassy in the northern hemisphere. There were more Anpreen in its long, small-windowed corridors than anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p><em>There are no aliens</em>, Serejen thought. <em>There is only the Clade. We are all family. Cjatay had insisted that.</em> The ship had sailed over the horizon, they hadn't called, they had drifted from each other's lives. Cjatay's name occasionally impinged on Serejen's awareness through radio interviews and opinion pieces. He had developed a darkly paranoid conspiracy theory around the Anpreen Presence. Serejen, high above the frozen streets of Jann in deeply abstract speculation about the physical reality of mathematics, occasionally mused upon the question of at what point the Migration had become a Presence. The Lonely often obsessively took up narrow, focused interests. Now the street was listening, acting. Great Winter always was a dark, paranoid season. <em>Here's how to understand</em>, Serejen thought. <em>There are no aliens after you've had sex with them.</em></p>

<p>Helicopter blades rattled from the walls of the College of Theoretical Physics and then retreated across the Central Canal. The silence in the warm, dimly lit little faculty cell was profound. At last, Serejen said, <q>I think we could go now.</q></p>

<p>On the street, cold stabbed even through the quilted layers of Serejen's greatcoat. He fastened the high collar across his throat and still he felt the breath crackle into ice around his lips. Seriantep stepped lightly between the half bricks and bottle shards in nothing more than the tunic and leggings she customarily wore around the college. Her motes gave her full control over her body, including its temperature.</p>

<p><q>You should have put something on,</q> Serejen said. <q>You're a bit obvious.</q></p>

<p>Past shuttered cafes and closed-up stores and the tall brick faces of the student Hearths. The burning tram on the Tunday Avenue junction blazed fitfully, its bitter smoke mingling with the eternal aromatic hydrocarbon smog exhaled by Jann's power plants. The trees that lined the avenue's centerstrip were folded down into tight fists, dreaming of summer. Their boot heels rang loud on the street tiles.</p>

<p>A darker shape upon the darkness moved in the narrow slit of an alley between two towering tenement blocks. Serejen froze, his heart jerked. A collar turned down, a face studying his&mdash;Obredajay from the Department of Field Physics.</p>

<p><q>Safe home.</q></p>

<p><q>Aye. And you.</q></p>

<p>The higher academics all held apartments within the Conservatorium and were safe within its walls; most of the research staff working late would sit it out until morning. Tea and news reports would see them through. Those out on the fickle streets had reasons to be there. Serejen had heard that Obredajay was head-over-heels infatuated with a new manfriend.</p>

<p><em>The dangers we court for little love.</em></p>

<p>On the intersection of Tunday Avenue and Yaskaray Wharf, a police robot stepped out of the impervious dark of the arches beneath General Gatoris Bridge. Pistons hissed it up to its full three meters; green light flicked across Serejen's retinas. Seriantep held up her hand, the motes of her palm displaying her immunity as a Prebendary of the Clade. The machine shrank down, seemingly dejected, if plastic and pumps could display such an emotion.</p>

<p>A solitary tea shop stood open on the corner of Silver Spider Entry and the Wharf, its windows misty with steam from the simmering urns. Security eyes turned and blinked at the two fleeing academics.</p>

<p>On Tannis Lane, they jumped them. There was no warning. A sudden surge of voices rebounding from the stone staircases and brick arches broke into a wave of figures lumbering around the turn of the alley, bulky and shouldering in their heavy winter quilts. Some held sticks, some held torn placards, some were empty-handed. They saw a man in a heavy winter coat, breath frosted on his mouth shield. They saw a woman almost naked, her breath easy, unclouded. They knew in an instant what she saw. The hubbub in the laneway became a roar.</p>

<p>Serejen and Seriantep were already in flight. Sensing rapid motion, the soles of Serejen's boots extended grips into the rime. As automatically, he felt the heart-numbing panic-rush ebb, felt himself lose his grip on his body and grow pale. Another was taking hold, his flight-or-fight Aspect; his cool, competent emergency service Fejannen.</p>

<p>He seized Seriantep's hand.</p>

<p><q>With me. Run!</q></p>

<p>Serejen-Fejannen saw the change of Aspect flicker across the tea-shop owner's face like weather as they barged through his door, breathless between his stables. Up to his counter with its looming, steaming urns of hot, hot water. This tea man wanted them out, wanted his livelihood safe.</p>

<p><q>We need your help.</q></p>

<p>The tea man's eyes and nostrils widened at the charge of rioters that skidded and slipped around the corner into Silver Spider Entry. Then his hand hit the button under the counter and the shutters rolled down. The shop boomed, the shutters bowed to fists striking them. Rocks banged like gunfire from metal. Voices rose and joined together, louder because they were unseen.</p>

<p><q>I've called the police,</q> Seriantep said. <q>They'll be here without delay.</q></p>

<p><q>No, they won't,</q> Fejannen said. He pulled out a chair from the table closest the car and sat down, edgily eying the gray slats of the shutter. <q>Their job is to restore order and protect property. Providing personal protection to aliens is far down their list of priorities.</q></p>

<p>Seriantep took the chair opposite. She sat down wary as a settling bird.</p>

<p><q>What's going on here? I don't understand. I'm very scared.</q></p>

<p>The cafe owner set two glasses of mat&eacute; down on the table. He frowned, then his eyes opened in understanding. An alien at his table. He returned to the bar and leaned on it, staring at the shutters beyond which the voice of the mob circled.</p>

<p><q>I thought you said you couldn't be killed.</q></p>

<p><q>That's not what I'm scared of. I'm scared of you, Serejen.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not Serejen. I'm Fejannen.</q></p>

<p><q>Who, what's Fejannen?</q></p>

<p><q>Me, when I'm scared, when I'm angry, when I need to be able to think clearly and coolly when a million tilings are happening at once, when I'm playing games or hunting or putting a big funding proposal together.</q></p>

<p><q>You sound&hellip; different.</q></p>

<p><q>I <em>am</em> different. How long have you been on our world?</q></p>

<p><q>You're hard. And cold. Serejen was never hard.</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not Serejen.</q></p>

<p>A huge crash&mdash;the shutter bowed under a massive impact and the window behind it shattered.</p>

<p><q>Right, that's it, I don't care what happens, you're going.</q> The tea man leaped from behind his counter and strode toward Seriantep. Fejannen was there to meet him.</p>

<p><q>This woman is a guest in your country and requires your protection.</q></p>

<p><q>That's not a woman. That's a pile of&hellip; insects. Things. Tiny things.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, they look like mighty scared tiny things.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't think so. Like you said, like they say on the news, they can't really die.</q></p>

<p><q>They can hurt. <em>She</em> can hurt.</q></p>

<p>Eyes locked, then disengaged. The mat&eacute;-man returned to his towering silos of herbal mash. The noise from the street settled into a stiff, waiting silence. Neither Fejannen nor Seriantep believed that it was true, that the mob had gone, despite the spearing cold out there. The lights flickered once, twice.</p>

<p>Seriantep said suddenly, vehemently, <q>I could take them.</q></p>

<p>The tea man looked up.</p>

<p><q>Don't,</q> Fejannen whispered.</p>

<p><q>I could. I could get out under the door. It's just a reforming.</q></p>

<p>The tea man's eyes were wide. A demon, a winter-grim in his prime location canal-side tea shop!</p>

<p><q>You scare them enough as you are,</q> Fejannen said.</p>

<p><q>Why? We're only here to help, to learn from you.</q></p>

<p><q>They think, what have you got to learn from <em>us?</em> They think that you're keeping secrets from us.</q></p>

<p><q>Us?</q></p>

<p><q>Them. Don't scare them anymore. The police will come, eventually, or the Conservatorium proctors. Or they'll just get bored and go home. These things never really last.</q></p>

<p><q>You're right.</q> She slumped back into her seat. <q>This fucking world&hellip; Oh, why did I come here?</q> Seriantep glanced up at the inconstant lumetubes, beyond to the distant diadem of her people's colonies, gravid on decades of water. It was a question, Fejannen knew, that Serejen had asked himself many times. A postgraduate scholar researching space-time topologies and the cosmological constant. A thousand-year-old posthuman innocendy wearing the body of a twenty-year-old woman, playing the student. She could learn nothing from him. All the knowledge the Anpreen wanderers had gained in their ten-thousand-year migration was incarnate in her motes. She embodied all truth and she lied with every cell of her body. Anpreen secrets. No basis for a relationship, yet Serejen loved her, as Serejen could love. But was it any more for her than a novelty; a tourist, a local boy, a brief summer loving?</p>

<p>Suddenly, vehemently, Seriantep leaned across the table to take Fejannen's face between her hands.</p>

<p><q>Come with me.</q></p>

<p><q>Where? Who?</q></p>

<p><q>Who?</q> She shook her head in exasperation. <q>Ahh! Serejen. But it would be you as well, it has to be you. To my place, to the Commonweal. I've wanted to ask you for so long. I'd love you to see my worlds. Hundreds of worlds, like jewels, dazzling in the sun. And inside, under the ice, the worlds within worlds within worlds&hellip; I made the application for a travel bursary months ago; I just couldn't ask.</q></p>

<p><q>Why? What kept you from asking?</q> A small but significant traffic of diplomats, scientists, and journalists flowed between Tay and the Anpreen fleet around Tejaphay. The returnees enjoyed global celebrity status, their opinions and experiences sought by think tanks and talk shows and news-site columns, the details of the faces and lives sought by the press. Serejen had never understood what it was the people expected from the celebrity of others but was not so immured behind the fortress walls of the Collegium, armored against the long siege of High Winter, that he couldn't appreciate its personal benefits. The lights seemed to brighten, the sense of the special hush outside, that was not true silence but waiting, dimmed as Serejen replaced Fejannen. <q>Why didn't you ask?</q></p>

<p><q>Because I thought you might refuse.</q></p>

<p><q>Refuse?</q> The few, the golden few. <q>Turn down the chance to work in the Commonweal? Why would anyone do that? What would I do that?</q></p>

<p>Seriantep looked long at him, her head cocked slighdy, alluringly, to one side, the kind of gesture an alien unused to a human body might devise.</p>

<p><q>You're Serejen again, aren't you?</q></p>

<p><q>I am that Aspect again, yes.</q></p>

<p><q>Because I thought you might refuse because of <em>her</em>. That other woman. Puzhay.</q></p>

<p>Serejen blinked three times. From Seriantep's face, he knew that she expected some admission, some confession, some emotion. He could not understand what.</p>

<p>Seriantep said, <q>I know about her. We know things at the Anpreen Mission. We check whom we work with. We have to. We know not everyone welcomes us, and that more are suspicious of us. I know who she is and where she lives and what you do with her three times a week when you go to her. I know where you were intending to go tonight, if all this hadn't happened.</q></p>

<p>Three times again, Serejen blinked. Now he was hot, too hot in his winter quilt in this steamy, fragrant tea-shop.</p>

<p><q>But that's a ridiculous question, I don't love Puzhay. <em>Nejben</em> does.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, but you <em>are</em> Nejben.</q></p>

<p><q>How many times do I have to tell you?</q> Serejen bit back the anger. There were Aspects hovering on the edge of his consciousness like the hurricane-front angels of the Bazjendi Psalmody&mdash;selves inappropriate to Seriantep. Aspects that in their rage and storm might lose him this thing, so finely balanced now in this tea shop. <q>It's our way,</q> he said weakly. <q>It's how we are.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, but</q>&mdash;Seriantep fought for words&mdash;<q>it's <em>you</em>, there, that body. You say it's different, you say it's someone else and not you, not Serejen, but how do I know that? How <em>can</em> I know that?</q></p>

<p><em>You say that, with your body that you said could take many forms, any form</em>, Serejen thought. Then Fejannen, shadowed but never more than a thought away in this besieged, surreal environment, heard a shift in the silence outside. The tea man glanced up. He had heard it, too. The difference between <em>waiting</em> and <em>anticipating.</em></p>

<p><q>Excuse me, I must change Aspects.</q></p>

<p>A knock on the shutter, glove-muffled. A voice spoke Fejannen's full name. A voice that Fejannen knew from his pervasive fear of the risk his academic Aspect was taking with Seriantep and that Serejen knew from those news reports and articles that broke through his vast visualizations of the topology of the universe and that Nejben knew from a tower-top cell and a video screen full of stars.</p>

<p><q>Can I come in?</q></p>

<p>Fejannen nodded to the tea man. He ran the shutter up high enough for the bulky figure in the long quilted coat and boots to duck under. Dreadful cold blew around Fejannen.</p>

<p>Cjatay bowed, removed his gloves, banging rime from the knuckles, and made the proper formalities to ascertain which Aspect he was speaking to.</p>

<p><q>I have to apologize; I only recently learned that it was you who were caught here.</q></p>

<p>The voice, the intonations and inflections, the overpreci-sions and refinements&mdash;no time might have passed since Cjatay walked out of Manifold House. In a sense, no time <em>had</em> passed; Cjatay was caught, inviolable, unchangeable by anything other than time and experience. Lonely.</p>

<p><q>The police will be here soon,</q> Seriantep said.</p>

<p><q>Yes, they will,</q> Cjatay said mildly. He looked Seriantep up and down, as if studying a zoological specimen. <q>They have us well surrounded now. These things are almost never planned; what we gain in spontaneity of expression we lose in strategy. But when I realized it was you, Fejannen-Nejben, I saw a way that we could all emerge from this intact.</q></p>

<p><q>Safe passage,</q> Fejannen said.</p>

<p><q>I will personally escort you out.</q></p>

<p><q>And no harm at all to you, politically.</q></p>

<p><q>I need to distance myself from what has happened tonight.</q></p>

<p><q>But your fundamental fear of the visitors remains unchanged?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't change. You know that. I see it as a virtue. Some things are solid, some things endure. Not everything changes with the seasons. But fear, you said. That's clever. Do you remember, that last time I saw you, back in the Manifold House. Do you remember what I said?</q></p>

<p><q>Nejben remembers you asking, Where are they migrating to? And what are they migrating from?</q></p>

<p><q>In all your seminars and tutorials and conferences, in all those questions about the shape of the universe&mdash;oh, we have our intelligences, too, less broad than the Anpreen's, but subtler, we think&mdash;did you ever think to <em>ask</em> that question: Why have you come here?</q> Cjatay's chubby, still childish face was an accusation.
<q>You are fucking her, I presume?</q></p>

<p>In a breath, Fejannen had slipped from his seat into the Third Honorable Offense Stance. A hand on his shoulder; the tea-shop owner. No honor in it, not against a Lonely. Fejannen returned to his seat, sick with shuddering rage.</p>

<p><q>Tell him,</q> Cjatay said.</p>

<p><q>It's very simple,</q> Seriantep said. <q>We are refugees. The Anpreen Commonweal is the surviving remnant of the effective annihilation of our subspecies of Panhumanity. Our eight hundred habitats are such a minuscule percentage of our original race that, to all statistical purposes, we are extinct. Our habitats once englobed an entire sun. We're all that's left.</q></p>

<p><q>How? Who?</q></p>

<p><q>Not so much <em>who</em>, as <em>when</em>,</q> Cjatay said gently. He flexed cold-blued fingers and pulled on his gloves.</p>

<p><q>They're coming?</q></p>

<p><q>We fear so,</q> Seriantep said. <q>We don't know. We were careful to leave no traces, to cover our tracks, so to speak, and we believe we have centuries of a head start on them. We are only here to refuel our habitats. Then we'll go hide ourselves in some great globular cluster.</q></p>

<p><q>But why, <em>why</em> would anyone do this? We're all the same species. That's what you told us. The Clade, Panhumanity.</q></p>

<p><q>Brothers disagree,</q> Cjatay said. <q>Families fall out, families feud within themselves. No animosity like it.</q></p>

<p><q>Is this true? How can this be true? Who knows about this?</q> Serejen strove with Fejannen for control and understanding. One of the first lessons the agisters of the Manifold House had taught was the etiquette of transition between conflicting Aspects. A war in the head, a conflict of selves. He could understand sibling strife on a cosmic scale. But a whole species?</p>

<p><q>The governments,</q> Cjatay said. To the tea man, <q>Open the shutter again. You'll be all right with us. I promise.</q> To Serejen, <q>Politicians, some senior academics, and policy makers. And us. Not you. But we all agree, we don't want to scare anyone. So we question the Anpreen Prebendaries on our world, and question their presence in our system, and maybe sometimes it bubbles into xenophobic violence, but that's fine, that's the price, that's nothing compared to what would happen if we realized that our guests might be drawing the enemies that destroyed them to our homes. Come on. We'll go now.</q></p>

<p>The tea man lifted the shutter. Outside, the protestors stood politely aside as Cjatay led the refugees out onto the street. There was not a murmur as Seriantep, in her ridiculous, life-threatening house clothes, stepped across the cobbles. The great Winter Clock on the tower of Alajnedeng stood at twenty past five. The morning shift would soon be starting, the hot-shops firing their ovens and fry-pots.</p>

<p>A murmur in the crowd as Serejen took Seriantep's hand.</p>

<p><q>Is it true?</q> he whispered.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> she said. <q>It is.</q></p>

<p>He looked up at the sky that would hold stars for another three endless months. The aurora coiled and spasmed over huddling Jann. Those stars were like crystal spearpoints. The universe was vast and cold and inimical to humanity, the greatest of Great Winters. He had never deluded himself that it would be otherwise. Power had been restored, yellow streedights glinted from the helmets of riot control officers and the carapaces of counterinsurgency drones. Serejen squeezed Seriantep's hand.</p>

<p><q>What you asked.</q></p>

<p><q>When?</q></p>

<p><q>Then. Yes. I will. Yes.</q></p>

<h3 class="small-caps">Torben, Melting</h3>

<p>The Anpreen shatter-ship blazed star-bright as it turned its face to the sun. A splinter of smart-ice, it was as intricate as a snowflake, stronger than any construct of Taynish engineering. Torben hung in free fall in the observation dome at the center of the cross of solar vanes. The Anpreen, being undifferentiated from the motes seeded through the hull, had no need for such architectural fancies. Their senses were open to space; the fractal shell of the ship was one great retina. They had grown the blister&mdash;pure and perfectly transparent construction-ice-for the comfort and delight of their human guests.</p>

<p>The sole occupant of the dome, Torben was also the sole passenger on this whole alien, paradoxical ship. Another would have been good. Another could have shared the daily, almost hourly shocks of strange and new and wonder. His other Aspects had felt with Torben the breath-catch of awe, and even greater privilege, when he had looked from the orbital car of the space elevator-the Anpreen's gift to the peoples of Tay-and seen the shatter-ship turn out of occultation in a blaze of silver light as it came in to dock. They had felt his glow of intellectual vindication as he first swam clumsily into the star-dome and discovered, with a shock, that the orbital transfer station was no more than a cluster of navigation lights almost lost in the star fields beyond. No sense of motion. His body had experienced no hint of acceleration. He had been correct. The Anpreen could adjust the topology of space-time. But there was no one but his several selves to tell it to. The Anpreen crew-Torben was not sure whether it was one or many, or if that distinction had any meaning&mdash;was remote and alien. On occasion, as he swam down the live-wood paneled corridors, monoflipper and web-mittens pushing thick, humid air, he had glimpsed a swirl of silver motes twisting and knotting like a captive waterspout. Always they had dispersed in his presence. But the ice beyond those wooden walls, pressing in around him, felt alive, crawling, aware.</p>

<p>Seriantep had gone ahead months before him.</p>

<p><q>There's work I have to do.</q></p>

<p>There had been a party; there was always a party at the Anpreen Mission among the ever-green slopes of generous, volcanic Sulanj. Fellow academics, press and PR from Ctarisphay, politicians, family members, and the Anpreen Prebendaries, eerie in their uniform loveliness.</p>

<p><q>You can do the research work on <em>Thirty-Third Tranquil Abode</em>, that's the idea,</q> Seriantep had said. Beyond the paper lanterns hung in the trees and the glow of the carbon-sink lagoon, the lights of space-elevator cars rose up until they merged with the stars. She would ride that narrow way to orbit within days. Serejen wondered how he would next recognize her.</p>

<p><q>You have to go.</q> Puzhay stood in the balcony of the Tea Lane Ladyhearth, recentiy opened to allow spring warmth into rooms that had sweated and stifled and stunk all winter long. She looked out at the shooting, uncoiling fresh green of the trees along Uskuben Avenue. Nothing there you have not seen before, Nejben thought. Unless it is something that is the absence of me.</p>

<p><q>It's not forever,</q> Nejben said. <q>I'll be back in a year, maybe two years.</q> <em>But not here</em>, he thought. He would not say it, but Puzhay knew it. As a returnee, the world's conservatoriums would be his. Bright cities, sun-warmed campuses far from the terrible cold on this polar continent, the winter that had driven them together.</p>

<p>All the good-byes, eightfold good-byes for each of his Aspects. And then he took sail for the ancient hospice of Bleyn, for sail was the only right way to come to those reefs of ceramic chapels that had clung to the Yesger atoll for three thousand hurricane seasons.</p>

<p><q>I need&hellip; another,</q> he whispered in the salt-breezy, chiming cloisters to Shaper Rejmen. <q>The curiosity of Serejen is too naive, the suspicion of Fejannen is too jagged, and the social niceties of Kekjay are too too eager to be liked.</q></p>

<p><q>We can work this for you,</q> the Shaper said. The next morning, he went down into the sweet, salt waters of the Other-ing Pots and let the programmed palps swarm over him, as he did for twenty mornings after. In the thunder-heavy gloaming of a late spring night storm, he awoke to find he was Torben. Clever, inquisitive, wary, socially adept, and conversationally witty Torben. Extreme need and exceptional circumstances permitted the creation of Nineths, but only, always, temporarily. Tradition as strong as an incest taboo demanded that the number of Aspects reflect the eight phases of Tay's manic seasons.</p>

<p>The Anpreen shatter-ship spun on its vertical axis and Torben Reris Orhum Fejannen Kekjay Prus Rejmer Serejen Nejben looked on in wonder. Down, up, forward: his orientation shifted with every breath of air in the observation dome. An eye, a monstrous eye. Superstition chilled him, childhood stories of the Dej-ved whose sole eye was the eye of the storm and whose body was the storm entire. Then he unfolded the metaphor. An anti-eye. Tejaphay was a shield of heartbreaking blue, streaked and whorled with perpetual storms. The Anpreen space habitat <em>Thirty-Third Tranquil Abode</em>, hard-docked these two years past to the anchor end of the space elevator, was a blind white pupil, an anti-pupil, an unseeing opacity. The shatter-ship was approaching from Tejaphay's axial plane; the mechanisms of the orbital pumping station were visible beyond the habitat's close horizon. The space elevator was a cobweb next to the habitat's three-hundred-kilometer bulk, less even than a thread compared to enormous Tejaphay, but as the whole assemblage turned into daylight, it woke sparkling, glittering as sun reflected from its billions of construction-ice scales. A fresh metaphor came to Torben: the sperm of the divine. <em>You're swimming the wrong way!</em> he laughed to himself, delighted at this infant Aspect's unsuspected tendency to express in metaphor what Serejen would have spoken in math, Kekjay in flattery, and Fejannen not at all. <em>No, it's our whole system it's fertilizing</em>, he thought.</p>

<p>The Anpreen ship drew closer, manipulating space-time on the centimeter scale. Surface details resolved from the ice glare. The hull of <em>Thirty-Third Tranquil Abode</em> was a chaotic mosaic of sensors, docks, manufacturing hubs, and still less comprehensible technology, all constructed from smart-ice. A white city. A flight of shatter-ships detached from docking arms like a flurry of early snow. Were some of those icy mesas defensive systems; did some of those ice canyons, as precisely cut as a skater's figures, conceal inconceivable weapons? Had the Anpreen ever paused to consider that to all cultures of Tay, white was the color of distrust, the white of snow in the long season of dark?</p>

<p>Days in free-gee had desensitized Torben sufficiendy so that he was aware of the subtle pull of nanogravity in his belly. Against the sudden excitement and the accompanying vague fear of the unknown, he tried to calculate the gravity of <em>Thirty-Third Tranquil Abode</em>, changing every hour as it siphoned up water from Tejaphay. While he was still computing the figures, the shatter-ship performed another orientation flip and came in to dock at one of the radial elevator heads, soft as a kiss to a loved face.</p>

<hr/>

<p>On tenth days, they went to the falls, Korpa and Belej, Sajhay and Hannaj, Yetger and Torben. When he stepped out of the elevator that had taken him down through thirty kilometers of solid ice, Torben had imagined something like the faculty of Jann; wooden-screen cloisters and courts roofed with ancient painted ceilings, thronged with bright, smart, talkative students boiling with ideas and vision. He found Korpa and Belej, Sajhay, Hannaj, and Yetger all together in a huge, windy construct of cells and tunnels and abrupt balconies and netted-in ledges, like a giant wasp's nest suspended from the curved ceiling of the interior hollow.</p>

<p><q>Continuum topology is a tad specialized, I'll admit that,</q> Belej said. She was a string-thin quantum-foam specialist from Yeldes in the southern archipelago of Ninnt, gone even thinner and bonier in the attenuated gravity of <em>Thirty-Third Tranquil Abode.</em> <q>If it's action you're looking for, you should get over to <em>Twenty-Eighth.</em> They're sociologists.</q></p>

<p>Sajhay had taught him how to fly.</p>

<p><q>There are a couple of differences from the transfer ship,</q> he said as he showed Torben how to pull up the fish-tail mono-tights and how the plumbing vents worked. <q>It's lo-gee, but it's not no-gee, so you will eventually come down again. And it's easy to build up too much delta-vee. The walls are light but they're strong and you will hurt yourself. And the nets are there for a reason. Whatever you do, don't go through them. If you end up in that sea, it'll take you apart.</q></p>

<p>That sea haunted Torben's unsettled, nanogee dreams. The world-sea, the two-hundred-and-twenty-kilometer-diameter sphere of water, its slow, huge nanogee waves forever breaking into globes and tears the size of clouds. The seething, dissolving sea into which the Anpreen dissipated, many lives into one immense, diffuse body that whispered to him through the paper tunnels of the Sojourners' house. Not so strange, perhaps. Yet he constanUy wondered what it would be like to fall in there, to swim against the tiny but nonnegligible gravity and plunge slowly, magnificently, into the boil of water-borne motes. In his imagination, there was never any pain, only the blissful, light-filled losing of self. So good to be free from the unquiet parliament of selves.</p>

<p><em>Eight is natural, eight is holy</em>, the Bleyn Shaper Yesger had whispered from behind ornate cloister grilles. <em>Eight arms, eight seasons. Nine must always be unbalanced.</em></p>

<p>Conscious of each other's too-close company, the guest scholars worked apart with their pupils. Seriantep met daily with Torben in a bulbous chapter house extruded from the mother nest. Tall hexagon-combed windows opened on the steeply downcurving horizons of <em>Thirty-Third Tranquil Abode</em>, stippled with the stalactite towers of tfiose Anpreen who refused the lure of the sea. Seriantep flew daily from such a tower down around the curve of the world to alight on Torben's balcony. She wore the same body he had known so well in the Jann Conservatorium, with the addition of a pair of functional wings in her back. She was a vision, she was a marvel, a spiritual creature from the aeons-lost motherworld of the Clade: an <em>angel.</em> She was beauty, but since arriving in <em>Thirty-Third Tranquil Abode</em>, Torben had only had sex with her twice. It was not the merman-angel thing, though that was a consideration to metaphor-and-ludicrous-conscious Torben. He didn't love her as Serejen had. She noticed, she commented.</p>

<p><q>You're not&hellip; the same.</q></p>

<p><em>Neither are you.</em> What he <em>said</em> was, <q>I know. I couldn't be. Serejen couldn't have lived here. Torben can. Torben is the only one who can.</q> <em>But for how long, before he splits into his component personalities?</em></p>

<p><q>Do you remember the way you&hellip; he&hellip; used to see numbers?</q></p>

<p><q>Of course I do. And before that, I remember how Ptey used to see numbers. He could look up into the night sky and tell you without counting, just by <em>knowing</em>, how many stars there were. He could see numbers. Serejen could make them <em>do</em> things. For me, Torben, the numbers haven't gone away, I just see them differently. I see them as clearly, as absolutely, but when I see the topospace transformations, I see them as words, as images and stories, as analogies. I can't explain it any better than that.</q></p>

<p><q>I think, no matter how long I try, how long any of us try, we will never understand how your multiple personalities work. To us, you seem a race of partial people, each a genius, a savant, in some strange obsessive way.</q></p>

<p><em>Are you deliberately trying to punish me?</em>Torben thought at the flicker-wing angel hovering before the ice-filled windows.</p>

True, he was making colossal intuitive leaps in his twisted, abstruse
discipline of space-time geometry. Not so abstruse: the Anpreen space
drives, which Taynish physicists said broke the laws of physics,
reached into the elevenspace substrate of the universe to locally
stretch or compress the expansion of space-time&mdash;foreshortening
ahead of the vehicle, inflating it behind. Thus the lack of any
measurable acceleration, it was the entire continuum within and around
the shatter-ship that had moved. Snowflakes and loxodromic curves had
danced in Torben's imagination: he had it, he had it. The secret of the
Anpreen: relativistic interstellar travel, was now open to the peoples
of Tay.
<p>The <em>other</em> secret of the Anpreen, that was.</p>

<p>For all his epiphanies above the spherical ocean, Torben knew that seminars had changed. The student had become the teacher, the master the pupil. <em>What is it you want from us?</em> Torben asked himself. <em>Truly want, truly need?</em></p>

<p><q>Don't know, don't care. All I know is, if I can find a commercial way to bubble quantum black holes out of elevenspace and tap the evaporation radiation, I'll have more money than God,</q> said Yetger, a squat, physically uncoordinated Oprann islander who relished his countrymen's reputation for boorish-ness, though Torben found him an affable conversationalist and a refined thinker. <q>You coming to the Falls on Tennay?</q></p>

<p>So they set off across the sky, a little flotilla of physicists with wine and sweet biscuits to dip in it. Those older and less sure of their bodies used little airscooter units. Torben flew. He enjoyed the exercise. The challenge of a totally alien language of movement intrigued him, the fish-tail flex of the flipper-suit. He liked what it was doing to his ass muscles.</p>

<p>The western windows of the Sojourners' house gave distant views of the Falls, but the sense of awe began twenty kilometers out when the thunder and shriek became audible over the constant rumble of sky traffic. The picnic party always flew high, close to the ceiling among the tower roots, so that long vistas would not spoil their pleasure. A dense forest of inverted trees, monster things grown kilometers tall in the nanogee, had been planted around the Falls, green and mist-watered by the spray. The scientists settled on one of the many platforms sculpted from the boulevard-wide branches. Torben gratefully peeled off his fin-tights, kicked his legs free, and spun to face the Falls.</p>

<p>What you saw, what awed you, depended on how you looked at it. Feet down to the world-sea, head up to the roof, it was a true fall, a cylinder of falling water two hundred meters across and forty kilometers long. Feet up, head down, it was even more terrifying, a titanic geyser. The water was pumped through from the receiving station at near supersonic speeds; where it met the ocean bead, the joined waters boiled and leaped kilometers high, broke into high looping curls and crests and globes, like the fantastical flarings of solar prominences. The roar was terrific. But for the noise-abatement properties of the nanoengineered leaves, it would have meant instant deafness. Torben could feel the tree branch, as massive as any buttress wall of Jann fortress-university, shudder beneath him.</p>

<p>Wine was opened and poured. The biscuits, atavistically hand-baked by Hannaj, one of whose Aspects was a master pastry chef, were dipped into it and savored. Sweet, the light sharpness of the wine and the salt mist of another world's stolen ocean tanged Torben's tongue.</p>

<p>There were rules to Tennays by the Falls. No work. No theory. No relationships. Five researchers made up a big enough group for family jealousy, small enough for cliquishness. Proper topics of conversation looked homeward; partnerships ended, children born, family successes and sicknesses, gossip, politics, and sports results.</p>

<p><q>Oh. Here.</q> Yetger sent a message flake spinning lazily through the air. The Sojourners' house exfoliated notes and messages from home onto slips of whisper-thin paper that peeled from the walls like eczema. The mechanism was poetic but inaccurate; intimate messages unfurled from unintended walls to turn and waft in the strange updrafts that ran through the nest's convoluted tunnels. It was the worst of forms to read another's message-scurf.</p>

<p>Torben unfolded the rustle of paper. He read it once, blinked, read it again. Then he folded precisely in eight and tucked it away in his top pocket.</p>

<p><q>Bad news?</q> For a broad beast of a man, Yetger was acute to emotional subtleties. Torben swallowed.</p>

<p><q>Nothing strange or startling.</q></p>

<p>Then he saw where Belej stared. Her gaze drew his, drew that of everyone in the picnic party. The Falls were failing. Moment by moment, they dwindled, from a deluge to a river, from a river to a stream to a jet, a hiding shrieking thread of water. On all the platforms on all the trees, Anpreen were rising into the air, hovering in swarms, as before their eyes the Falls sputtered and ceased. Drops of water, fat as storms, formed around the lip of the suddenly exposed nozzle to break and drift, quivering, down to the spherical sea. The silence was profound. Then the trees seemed to shower blossoms as the Anpreen took to the air in hosts and choirs, flocking and storming.</p>

<p>Numbers and images flashed in Torben's imagination. The fueling could not be complete, was weeks from being complete. The ocean would fill the entire interior hollow, the stalactite cities transforming into strange reef communities. Fear gripped him and he felt Fejannen struggle to free himself from the binding into Torben. I <em>need you here, friend</em>, Torben said to himself, and saw that the others had made the same calculations.</p>

<p>They flew back, a ragged flotilla strung across kilometers of airspace, battling through the ghostly aerial legions of Anpreen. The Sojourners' house was filled with fluttering, gusting message slips shed from the walls. Torben snatched one from the air and against all etiquette read it.</p>

<p><em>Sajhay are you all right what's happening? Come home, we are all worried about you. Love Mihenj.</em></p>

<p>The sudden voice of Suguntung, the Anpreen liaison, filled every cell of the nest, an order&mdash;polite, but an order&mdash;to come to the main viewing lounge, where an important announcement would be made. Torben had long suspected that Suguntung never left the Sojourners' house, merely deliquesced from hom-iniform into airborne motes, a phase transition.</p>

<p>Beyond the balcony nets, the sky seethed, an apocalypse of insect humanity and storm clouds black as squid ink rolling up around the edge of the world ocean.</p>

<p><q>I have grave news,</q> Suguntung said. He was a gray, sober creature, light and lithe and androgynous, without any salting of wit or humor.
<q>At 12:18 Taynish Enclave time, we detected gravity waves passing
through the system. These are consistent with a large numbers of bodies
decelerating from relativistic flight.</q></p>

<p>Consternation. Voices shouting. Questions questions questions. Suguntung held up a hand and there was quiet.</p>

<p><q>On answer to your questions, somewhere in the region of thirty-eight thousand objects. We estimate them at a range of seventy astronomical units beyond the edge of the Kuiper Belt, decelerating to ten percent lightspeed for system transition.</q></p>

<p><q>Ninety-three hours until they reach us,</q> Torben said. The numbers, the colored numbers, so beautiful, so distant.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> said Suguntung.</p>

<p><q>Who are they?</q> Belej asked.</p>

<p><q>I know,</q> Torben said. <q>Your enemy.</q></p>

<p><q>We believe so,</q> Suguntung answered. <q>There are characteristic signatures in the gravity waves and the spectral analysis.</q></p>

<p>Uproar. By a trick of the motes, Suguntung could raise his voice to a roar that could shout down a crowd of angry physicists.</p>

<p><q>The Anpreen Commonweal is making immediate preparations for departure. As a matter of priority, evacuation for all guests and visitors has been arranged and will commence immediately. A transfer ship is already waiting. We are evacuating the system not only for our own protection, but to safeguard you as well. We believe that the Enemy has no quarrel with you.</q></p>

<p><em><q>Believe?</q></em> Yetger spat. <q>Forgive me if I'm less than completely reassured by that!</q></p>

<p><q>But you haven't got enough water,</q> Torben said absently, amazed by the numbers and pictures swimming around in his head, as the message leaves of concern and hope and come-home-soon fluttered around. <q>How many habitats are fully fueled? Five hundred, five hundred and fifty? You haven't got enough, even this one is at eighty percent capacity. What's going to happen to them?</q></p>

<p><q>I don't give a fuck what happens to them!</q> Hannaj had always been the meekest and least assertive of men, brilliant but forever hamstrung by self-doubt. Now, threatened, naked in space, pierced through and through by the gravity waves of an unknowable power, his anger burned.
<q>I want to know what's going to happen to <em>us</em>.</q></p>

<p><q>We are transferring the intelligences to the interstellar-capable habitats.</q> Suguntung spoke to Torben alone.</p>

<p><q>Transferring; you mean copying,</q> Torben said. <q>And the originals that are left, what happens to them?</q></p>

<p>Suguntung made no answer.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Yetger found Torben floating in the exact center of the viewing lounge, moving his tail just enough to maintain him against the microgee.</p>

<p><q>Where's your stuff?</q></p>

<p><q>In my cell.</q></p>

<p><q>The shatter-ship's leaving in an hour.</q></p>

<p><q>I know.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, maybe you should, you know-</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not going.</q></p>

<p><q>You're <em>what</em>?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm not going, I'm staying here.</q></p>

<p><q>Are you insane?</q></p>

<p><q>I've talked to Suguntung and Seriantep. It's fine. There are a couple of others on the other habitats.</q></p>

<p><q>You have to come home. We'll need you when they come.</q></p>

<p><q>Ninety hours and twenty-five minutes to save the world? I don't think so.</q></p>

<p><q>It's home, man.</q></p>

<p><q>It's not. Not since <em>this</em>.</q> Torben flicked the folded note of his secret pocket, offered it to Yetger between clenched fingers.</p>

<p><q>Oh.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes.</q></p>

<p><q>You're dead. We're all dead, you know that.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I know. In the few minutes it takes me to reach wherever the Anpreen Migration goes next, you will have aged and died many times over. I know that, but it's not home. Not now.</q></p>

<p>Yetger ducked his head in sorrow that did not want to be seen, then in a passion hugged Torben hugely to him, kissed him hard.</p>

<p><q>Good-bye. Maybe in the next one.</q></p>

<p><q>No, I don't think so. One is all we get. And that's a good enough reason to go out there where none of our people have ever been before, I think.</q></p>

<p><q>Maybe it is.</q> Yetger laughed, the kind of laughter that is on the edge of tears. Then he spun and kicked off up through the ceiling door, his duffel of small possessions trailing from his ankle.</p>

<hr/>

<p>For an hour now, he had contemplated the sea and thought that he might just be getting the way of it, the fractal patterns of the ripples, the rhythms and the microstorms that blew up in squalls and waves that sent globes of water quivering into the air that, just as quickly, were subsumed back into the greater sea. He understood it as music, deeply harmonized. He wished one of his Aspects had a skill for an instrument. Only choirs, vast ensembles, could capture the music of the water bead. <q>It's ready now.</q></p>

All the while Torben had calculated the music of the sea, Seriantep had
worked on the smart-paper substrate of the Sojourners' house. Now the
poll was complete, a well in the floor of the lounge. <em>When I leave, will it revert?</em> Torben thought, the small, trivial wit that fights fear. <em>Will it go back to whatever it was before, or was it always only just Suguntung?</em>
The slightest of gestures and Seriantep's wisp-dress fell from her. The
floor ate it greedily. Naked and wingless now in this incarnation, she
stepped backward into the water, never for an instant taking her eyes
from Torben.
<p><q>Whenever you're ready,</q> she said. <q>You won't be hurt.</q></p>

<p>She lay back into the receiving water. Her hair floated out around her, coiled and tangled as she came apart. There was nothing ghastly about it, no decay into meat and gut and vile bone, no grinning skelton fizzing apart in the water like sodium. A brightness, a turning to motes of light. The hair was the last to go. The pool seethed with motes. Torben stepped out of his clothes.</p>

<p><em>I'm moving on. It's for the best. Maybe not for you. For me. You see, I didn't think I'd mind, but I did. You gave it all up so easily, just like that, off into space. There is someone else. It's Cjatay. I heard what he was saying, and as time went by, as I didn't hear from you, it made sense. I know I'm reacting. I think I owe you that, at least. We're all right together. With him, you get everything, I find I can live with that. I think I like it. I'm sorry, Torben, but this is what I want.</em></p>

<p>The note sifted down through the air like a falling autumn leaf to join the hundreds of others that lay on the floor. Torben's feet kicked up as he stepped down into the water. He gasped at the electrical tingle, then laughed, and, with a great gasp, emptied his lungs and threw himself under the surface. The motes swarmed and began to take him apart. As the <em>Thirty-Third Tranquil Abode</em> broke orbit around Tejaphay, the abandoned space elevator coiling like a severed artery, the bottom of the Sojourners' house opened, and, like a tear, the mingled waters fell to the sea below.</p>

<section class="chapter">
<h3 class="small-caps">Jedden, Running</h3>

<p>Eighty years Jedden had fallen, dead as a stone, silent as light. Every five years, a few subjective minutes so close to light-speed, he woke up his senses and sent a slush of photons down his wake to see if the hunter was still pursuing.</p>

<p>Redshifted to almost indecipherability, the photons told him, <em>Yes, still there, still gaining.</em> Then he shut down his senses, for even that brief wink, that impact of radiation blueshifted to gamma frequencies on the enemy engine field, betrayed him. It was decades since he had risked the scalarity drive. The distortions it left in space-time advertised his position over most of a quadrant. Burn quick, burn hot and fast, get to lightspeed if it meant reducing his reaction mass perilously close to the point where he would not have sufficient time ever to brake. Then go dark, run silent and swift, coasting along in high-time dilation where years passed in hours.</p>

<p>Between wakings, Jedden dreamed. He dreamed down into the billions of lives, the dozens of races and civilizations that the Anpreen had encountered in their long migration. The depth of their history had stunned Jedden, as if he were swimming and, looking down, discovered beneath him not the green water of the lagoon but the clear blue drop of the continental shelf. Before they englobed their sun with so many habitats that it became discernible only as a vast infrared glow, before even the wave of expansion that had brought them to that system, before even they became motile, when they wore mere bodies, they had been an extroverted, curious race, eager for the similarities and differences of other subspecies of Panhumanity. Records of the hundreds of societies they had contacted were stored in the spin states of the quantum-ice flake that comprised the soul of Jedden. Cultures, customs, ways of being human were simulated in such detail that, if he wished, Jedden could have spent eons living out their simulated lives. Even before they had reached the long-reprocessed moon of their home world, the Anpreen had encountered a light-sail probe of the Ekkad, three hundred years out on a millennium-long survey of potential colony worlds. As they converted their asteroid belts into habitat rings, they had fought a savage war for control of the high country against the Okranda asteroid colonies that had dwelled there, hidden and unsuspected, for twenty thousand years. The doomed Okranda had, as a final, spiteful act, seared the Anpreen home world to the bedrock, but not before the Anpreen had absorbed and recorded the beautiful, insanely complex hierarchy of caste, classes, and societies that had evolved in the baroque cavities of the sculpted asteroids. Radio transmission had drawn them out of their Oort cloud across two hundred light-years to encounter the dazzling society of the Jad. From them, the Anpreen had learned the technology that enabled them to pload themselves into free-flying nanomotes and become a true Level Two civilization.</p>

<p>People and beasts, machines and woods, architectures and moralities, and stories beyond counting. Among the paraphernalia and marginalia of a hundred races, were the ones who had destroyed the Anpreen, who were now hunting Jedden down over all the long years, closing meter by meter.</p>

<p>So he spent hours and years immersed in the great annual eisteddfod of the Barrant-Hoj, where one of the early generation of seed ships (early in that it was the seed of the seed of the seed of the first flowering of mythical Earth) had been drawn into the embrace of a fat, slow hydrocarbon-rich gas giant and birthed a brilliant, brittle airborne culture, where blimp-cities rode the edge of storms wide enough to drown whole planets and the songs of the contestants-gas-bag-spider creatures huge as reefs, fragile as honeycomb&mdash;belled in infrasonic wavefronts kilometers between crests and changed entire climates. It took Barrant-Hoj two hominiform lifetimes to circle its sun&mdash;the Anpreen had chanced upon the song-spiel, preserved it, hauled it out of the prison of gas giant's gravity well, and given it to greater Clade.</p>

<p>Jedden blinked back into interstellar flight. He felt&mdash;he imagined&mdash;tears on his face as the harmonies reverberated within him. Cantos could last days, chorales entire weeks. Lost in music. A moment of revulsion at his body, this sharp, unyielding thing of ice and energies. The hunter's ramscoop fusion engine advertised its presence across a thousand cubic light-years. It was inelegant and initially slow, but, unlike Jed-den's scalarity drive, was light and could live off the land. The hunter would be, like Jedden, a ghost of a soul impressed on a Bose-condensate quantum chip, a mote of sentience balanced on top of a giant drive unit. The hunter was closing, but was no closer than Jedden had calculated. Only miscalculation could kill you in interstellar war. The equations were hard but they were fair.</p>

<p>Two hundred and three years to the joke point. It would be close, maybe close enough for the enemy's greed to blind him. Miscalculation and self-deception, these were the killers in space. And luck. Two centuries. Time enough for a few moments' rest.</p>

<p>Among all the worlds was one he had never dared visit: the soft blue tear of Tay. There, in the superposed spin states, were all the lives he could have led. The lovers, the children, the friends and joys and mundanities. Puzhay was there, Cjatay, too. He could make of them anything he wanted: Puzhay faithful, Cjatay Manifold, no longer Lonely.</p>

<p>Lonely. He understood that now, eighty light-years out and decades to go before he could rest.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Extraordinary, how painless it had been. Even as the cells of Torben's body were invaded by the motes into which Seriantep had dissolved, even as they took him apart and rebuilt him, even as they read and copied his neural mappings, there was never a moment where fleshly Torben blinked out and nan-otechnological Torben winked in. There was no pain. Never pain, only a sense of wonder, of potential racing away to infinity on every side, of a new birth-or, it seemed to him, an an-tibirth, a return to the primal, salted waters. As the globe of mingled motes dropped slow and quivering and full as a breast toward the world-ocean, Torben still thought of himself as Tor-ben, as a man, an individual, as a body. Then they hit and burst and dissolved into the sea of seething motes, and voices and selves and memories and personalities rushed in on him from every side, clamoring, a sea-roar. Every life in every detail. Senses beyond his native five brought him impression upon impression upon impression. Here was intimacy beyond anything he had ever known with Seriantep. As he communed, he was communed with. He knew that the Anpreen government (now he understood the reason for the protracted and ungainly negotiations with Tay: the two representations had almost no points of communication) were unwrapping him to construct a deep map of Tay and its people-rather, the life and Aspects of one undersocialized physics researcher. Music. All was music. As he understood this, Anpreen Commonweal Habitat <em>Thirty-Third Tranquil Abode</em>, with its five hundred and eighty-two companions, crossed one hundred and nineteen light-years to the Mil-ius 1183 star system.</p>

<p>One hundred and nineteen light-years, eight months subjective, in which Torben Reris Orhum Fejannen Kekjay Prus Rejmer Serejen Nejben ceased to exist. In the mote-swarm, time, like identity, could be anything you assigned it to be. To the self now known as Jedden, it seemed that he had spent twenty years of resubjectivized time in which he had grown to be a profound and original thinker in the Commonweal's physics community. Anpreen life had only enhanced his instinctive ability to see and apprehend number. His insights and contributions were startling and creative. Thus it had been a pure formality for him to request a splinter-ship to be spun off from <em>Thirty-Third Tranquil Abode</em> as the fleet entered the system and dropped from relativistic flight at the edge of the Oort cloud. A big fat splinter-ship with lots of fuel to explore space-time topological distortions implicit in the orbital perturbations of inner Kuiper Belt cubewanos for a year, a decade, a century, and then come home.</p>

So he missed the annihilation. 
<p>Miscalculation kills. Lack of circumspection kills. Blind assumption kills. The Enemy had planned their trap centuries ahead. The assault on the Tay system had been a diversion; the thirty-eight thousand drive signatures mosdy decoys; propulsion units and guidance systems and little else scattered among a handful of true battleships dozens of kilometers long. Even as lumbering, barely mobile Anpreen habitats and Enemy attack drones burst across Tay's skies, so bright they even illuminated the sun-glow of High Summer, the main fleet was working around Milius 1183. A work of decades, year upon year of slow modifications, staggering energies, careful careful concealment and camouflage, as the Enemy sent their killing hammer out on its long slow loop.</p>

<p>Blind assumption. The Anpreen saw a small red sun at affordable range to the ill-equipped fleet. They saw there was water there, water; worlds of water to reequip the Commonweal and take it fast and far beyond the reach of the Enemy in the great star clouds that masked the galactic core. In their haste they failed to note that Milius 1183 was a binary system, a tired red dwarf star and a companion neutron star in photosphere-grazing eight-hour orbit. Much less then did they notice that the neutron star was missing.</p>

<p>The trap was perfect and complete. The Enemy had predicted perfectly. Their setup was flawless. The hunting fleet withdrew to the edges of system; all that remained were the relays and autonomous devices. Blindsided by sunglare, the Anpreen sensoria had only milliseconds of warning before the neutron star impacted Milius 1183 at eight percent lightspeed.</p>

<p>The nova would in time be visible over a light-century radius. Within its spectrum, careful astronomers might note the dark lines of hydrogen, oxygen, and smears of carbon. Habitats blew away in sprays of plasma. The handful of stragglers that survived battled to reconstruct their mobility and life-support systems. Shark-ships hidden half a century before in the rubble of asteroid belts and planetary ring systems woke from their long sleeps and went a-hunting.</p>

<p>Alone in his splinter-ship in the deep dark, Jedden, his thoughts outward to the fabric of space-time and at the same time inward to the beauty of number, the song within him, saw the system suddenly turn white with death light. He heard five hundred billion sentients die. All of them, all at once, all their voices and hearts. He heard Seriantep die, he heard those other Taynish die, those who had turned away from their home world in the hope of knowledge and experience beyond anything their world could offer. Every life he had ever touched, that had ever been part of him, that had shared number or song or intimacy beyond fleshly sex. He heard the death of the Anpreen migration. Then he was alone. Jedden went dark for fifty years. He contemplated the annihilation of the last of the Anpreen. He drew up escape plans. He waited. Fifty years was enough. He lit the scalarity drive. Space-time stretched. Behind him, he caught the radiation signature of a fusion drive igniting and the corresponding electromagnetic flicker of a scoopfield going up. Fifty years was not enough.</p>

<p>That would be his last miscalculation.</p>

<p>Twenty years to bend his course away from Tay. Another ten to set up the deception. <em>As you deceived us, so I will fool you</em>, Jedden thought as he tacked ever closer to lightspeed. <em>And with the same device, a neutron star.</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>Jedden awoke from the sleep that was beyond dreams, a whisper away from death, that only disembodied intelligences can attain. The magnetic vortex of the hunter's scoopfield filled half the sky. Less than the diameter of a light-minute separated them. Within the next ten objective years, the Enemy ship would overtake and destroy Jedden. Not with physical weapons or even directed energy, but with information: skullware and dark phages that would dissolve him into nothingness or worse, isolate him from any external sense or contact, trapped in unending silent, nerveless darkness.</p>

<p>The moment, when it came, after ninety light-years, was too fine-grained for nonuniform intelligence. Jedden's subroutines, the autonomic responses that controlled the ship that was his body, opened the scalarity drive and summoned the dark energy. Almost instantly, the Enemy responded to the course change, but that tiny relativistic shift, the failure of simultaneity, was Jedden's escape and life.</p>

<p>Among the memories frozen into the heart of the Bose-Einstein condensate were the star logs of the Cush Ne, a fellow migrant race the Anpreen had encountered-by chance, as all such meets must be&mdash;in the big cold between stars. Their star maps charted a rogue star, a neutron dwarf ejected from its stellar system and wandering dark and silent, almost invisible, through deep space. Decades ago, when he felt the enemy ram-field go up and knew that he had not escaped, Jedden had made the choice and the calculations. Now he turned his flight, a prayer short of lightspeed, toward the wandering star.</p>

<p>Jedden had long ago abolished fear. Yet he experienced a strange psychosomatic sensation in that part of the splinter-ship that corresponded to his testicles. Balls tightening. The angle of insertion was so precise that Jedden had had to calculate the impact of stray hydroxyl radicals on his ablation field. One error would send him at relativistic speed head-on into a neutron star. But he did not doubt his ability, he did not fear, and now he understood what the sensation in his phantom testicles was. Excitement.</p>

<p>The neutron star was invisible, would always be invisible, but Jedden could feel its gravity in every part of his body, a quaking, quailing shudder, a music of a hundred harmonies as different parts of the smart-ice hit their resonant frequencies. A chorale in ice and adrenaline, he plunged around the neutron star. He could hope that the hunting ship would not survive the passage, but the Enemy, however voracious, was surely never so stupid as to run a scoop ship through a neutron star's terrifying magnetic terrain with the drive field up. That was not his strategy anyway. Jedden was playing the angles. Whipping tight around the intense gravity well, even a few seconds of slowness would amplify into light-years of distance, decades of lost time. Destruction would have felt like a cheat. Jedden wanted to win by geometry. By calculation, we live.</p>

<p>He allowed himself one tiny flicker of a communication laser. Yes. The Enemy was coming. Coming hard, coming fast, coming <em>wrong.</em> Tides tore at Jedden; every molecule of his smart-ice body croaked and moaned, but his own cry rang louder and he slingshotted around the neutron. <em>Yes!</em> Before him was empty space. The splinter-ship would never fall of its own accord into another gravity well. He lacked sufficient reaction mass to enter any Clade system. Perhaps the Enemy had calculated this in the moments before he, too, entered the neutron star's transit. An assumption. In space, assumptions kill. Deep in his quantum memories, Jedden knew what was out there. The slow way home.</p>

<h3 class="small-caps">Fast Man, Slowly</h3>

<p>Kites, banners, pennants, and streamers painted with the scales and heads of ritual snakes flew from the sun rigging on the Festival of Fast Children. At the last minute, the climate people had received budgetary permission to shift the prevailing winds lower. The Clave had argued that the Festival of Fast Children seemed to come around every month and a half, which it did, but the old and slow said, <em>Not to the children it doesn't.</em></p>

<p>Fast Man turned off the dust road onto the farm track. The wooden gate was carved with the pop-eyed, O-mouthed hearth gods, the chubby, venal guardians of agricultural Yoe Canton. As he slowed to Parent Speed, the nodding heads of the meadow flowers lifted to a steady metronome tick. The wind-rippled grass became a restless choppy sea of currents and crosscurrents. Above him, the clouds raced down the face ofthe sun-rod that ran the length of the environment cylinder, and in the wide yard before the frowning eaves of the ancient earthen manor, the children, preparing for the ritual Beating of the Sun-lines, became plumes of dust.</p>

<p>For three days, he had walked up the eternal hill of the cylinder curve, through the tended red forests of Canton Ahaea. Fast Man liked to walk. He walked at Child Speed and they would loop around him on their bicycles and ped-cars and then pull away shouting, <em>You're not so fast, Fast Man!</em> He could have caught them, of course; he could have easily outpaced them. They knew that; they knew he could on a wish take the form of a bird, or a cloud, and fly away from them up to the ends of the world. Everyone in the Three Worlds knew Fast Man. He needed neither sleep nor food, but he enjoyed the taste of the highly seasoned, vegetable-based cuisine of the Middle Cantons and their light but fragrant beer, so he would call each night at a hostel or township pub. Then he would drop down into Parent Speed and talk with the locals. Children were fresh and bright and inquiring, but for proper conversation, you needed adults.</p>

<p>The chirping cries of the children rang around the grassy eaves of Toe Yau Manor. The community had gathered, among them the Toe Yau's youngest, a skipping five-year-old. In her own speed, that was. She was months old to her parents; her birth still a fresh and painful memory. The oldest, the one he had come about, was in his early teens. Noha andjehau greeted Fast Man with water and bread.</p>

<p><q>God save all here,</q> Fast Man said as he blessed them. Little Nemaha flickered around him like summer evening bugs. He heard his dual-speech unit translate the greeting into Children Speech in a chip of sound. This was his talent and his fame; that his mind and words could work in two times at once. He was the generational ambassador to three worlds.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The three great cylinders of the Aeo Taea colony fleet were fifty Adult Years along in their journey to the star Sulpees 2157 in the Anpreen categorization. A sweet little golden star with a gas giant pressed up tight to it and, around that gas world, a sun-warmed, tear-blue planet. Their big, slow lathe-sculpted asteroids, two hundred kilometers long, forty across their flats, had appeared as three small contacts at the extreme edge of the Commonweal's sensory array. Too far from their flightpath to the Tay system and, truth be told, too insignificant. The galaxy was festering with little subspecies, many of them grossly ignorant that they were part of an immeasurably more vast and glorious Clade, all furiously engaged on their own grand little projects and empires. Races became significant when they could push lightspeed. Ethnologists had noted as a point of curiosity a peculiar time distortion to the signals, as if everything had been slowed to a tenth of normal speed. Astrogators had put it down to an unseen gravitational lensing effect and noted course and velocity of the lumbering junk as possible navigation hazards.</p>

<p>That idle curiosity, that moment of fastidiousness of a now-dead, now-vaporized Anpreen who might otherwise have dismissed it, had saved Jedden. There had always been more hope than certainty in the mad plan he had concocted as he watched the Anpreen civilization end in nova light. Hope as he opened up the dark energy that warped space-time in calculations made centuries before that would only bear fruit in centuries to come. Hope as he woke up, year upon year in the long flight to the stray neutron star, always attended by doubt. The slightest miscalculation could throw him off by light-years and centuries. He himself could not die, but his reaction mass was all too mortal. Falling forever between stars was worse than any death. He could have abolished that doubt with a thought, but so would the hope have been erased to become mere blind certainty.</p>

<p>Hoping and doubting, he flew out from the slingshot around the neutron star.</p>

<p>Because he could hope, he could weep; smart-ice tears when his long-range radars returned three slow-moving images less than five light-hours from the position he had computed.</p>

As he turned the last of his reaction mass into dark energy to match
his velocity with the Aeo Taea armada, a stray calculation crossed his
consciousness. In all his redefinitions and reformations, he had never
given up the ability to see numbers, to hear what they whispered to
him. He was half a millennium away from the lives he had known on Tay.
<p>For ten days, he broadcast his distress call. <em>Help, I am a refugee from a star war.</em> He knew that, in space, there was no rule of the sea, as there had been on Tay's world ocean, no Aspects at once generous, stern, and gallant that had been known as SeaSelves. The Aeo Taea could still kill him with negligence. But he could sweeten them with a bribe.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Like many of the country houses of Amoa ark, Toe Yau Manor featured a wooden belvedere, this one situated on a knoll two fields spinward from the old house. Airy and gracious, woven from genetweak willow plaits, it and its country cousins all across Amoa's Cantons had become a place for Adults, where they could mix with ones of their own speed, talk without the need for the hated speech converters around their necks, gripe and moan and generally gossip, and, through the central roof iris, spy through the telescope on their counterparts on the other side of the world. Telescope parties were the latest excuse for Parents to get together and complain about their children.</p>

<p>But this was their day&mdash;though it seemed like a week to them-the Festival of Fast Children, and this day Noha Toe Yau had his telescope trained not on his counterpart beyond the sun, but on the climbing teams fizzing around the sun-riggings, tens of kilometers above the ground, running out huge mono-weave banners and fighting ferocious kite battles high where the air was thin.</p>

<p><q>I tell you something, no child of mine would ever be let do so damn fool a thing,</q> Noha Toe Yau grumbled. <q>I'll be surprised if any of them makes it to the Destination.</q></p>

<p>Fast Man smiled, for he knew that he had only been called because Yemoa Toe Yau was doing something much more dangerous.</p>

<p>Jehau Toe Yau poured chocolate, thick and cooling and vaguely hallucinogenic.</p>

<p><q>As long as he's back before Starship Day,</q> she said. She frowned down at the wide green before the manor where the gathered Fast Children of the neighborhood in their robes and fancies were now hurtling around the long trestles of festival foods. They seemed to be engaged in a high-velocity food fight. <q>You know, I'm sure they're speeding the days up. Not much, just a little every day, but definitely speeding them up. Time goes nowhere these days.</q></p>

<p>Despite a surprisingly sophisticated matter-antimatter propulsion system, the Aeo Taea fleet was limited to no more than 10 percent of lightspeed, far below the threshold where time dilation became perceptible. The crossing to the Destination-Aeo Taea was a language naturally given to Portentous Capitalizations, Fast Man had discovered&mdash;could only be made by generation ship. The Aeo Taea had contrived to do it in just one generation. The strangely slow messages the Anpreen had picked up from the fleet were no fluke of space-time distortion. The voyagers' bodies, their brains, their perceptions and metabolisms, had been engineered in vitro to run at one-tenth hom-iniform normal. Canned off from the universe, the interior lighting, the gentle spin gravity, and the slow, wispy climate easily adjusted to a life lived at a snail's pace. Morning greetings lasted hours, that morning a world-week. Seasons endured for what would have been years in the outside universe, vast languorous autumns. The three hundred and fifty years of the crossing would pass in the span of an average working career. Amoa was a world of the middle-aged.</p>

<p>Then Fast Man arrived and changed everything.</p>

<p><q>Did he give any idea where he was going?</q> Fast Man asked. It was always the boys. Girls worked it through, girls could see further.</p>

<p>Jehau pointed down. Fast Man sighed. Rebellion was limited in Amoa, where any direction you ran led you swiftly back to your own doorstep. The wires that rigged the long sun could take you high, kilometers above it all in your grand indignation. Everyone would watch you through their telescopes, up there high and huffing, until you got hungry and wet and bored and had to come down again. In Amoa, the young soul rebels went <em>out.</em></p>

<p>Fast Man set down his chocolate glass and began the subtle exercise that reconfigured the motes of his malleable body. To the Toe Yaus, he seemed to effervesce slightly, a sparkle like fine silver talc or the dust from a moth's wings. Jehau's eyes widened. All the three worlds knew of Fast Man, who had brought the end of the Journey suddenly within sight, soothed generational squabbles, and found errant children&mdash;and so everyone thought they knew him personally. Truly, he was an alien.</p>

<p><q>It would help considerably if they left some idea of where they were going,</q> Fast Man said. <q>There's a lot of space out there. Oh well. I'd stand back a little, by the way.</q> He stood up, opened his arms in a little piece of theater, and exploded into a swarm of motes. He towered to a buzzing cylinder that rose from the iris at the center of the belvedere. <em>See this through your telescopes on the other side of the world and gossip.</em> Then, in a thought, he speared into the earth and vanished.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the end, the Fast Boy was pretty much where Fast Man reckoned he would be. He came speed-walking up through the salt-dead cityscape of the communications gear just above the convex flaring of the drive shield, and there he was, nova-bright in Fast Man's radar sight. A sweet, neat little cranny in the main dish gantry with a fine view over the construction site. Boys and building. His complaining to the Toe Yaus had been part of the curmudgeonly image he liked to project. Boys were predictable things.</p>

<p><q>Are you not getting a bit cold up there?</q> Fast Man asked. Yemoa started at the voice crackling in his helmet phones. He looked around, helmet tilting from side to side as he tried to pick the interloper out of the limitless shadow of interstellar space. Fast Man increased his surface radiance. He knew well how he must seem; a glowing man, naked to space, toes firmly planted on the pumice-dusted hull and leaning slightly forward against the spin force. He would have terrified himself at that age, but awe worked for the Fast Children as amiable curmudgeon worked for their slow parents.</p>

<p><q>Go away.</q></p>

<p>Fast Man's body-shine illuminated the secret roots. Yemoa Toe Yau was spindly even in the tight yellow and green pressure skin. He shuffled around to turn his back, a deadlier insult among the Aeo Taea than among the Aspects of Tay for all their diverse etiquettes. Fast Man tugged at the boy's safety lanyard. The webbing was unfrayed, the carabiner latch operable.</p>

<p><q>Leave that alone.</q></p>

<p><q>You don't want to put too much faith in those things. Cosmic rays can weaken the structure of the plastic: put any tension on them, and they snap just like that, just when you need them most. Yes sir, I've seen people just go sailing out there, right away out there.</q></p>

<p>The helmet, decorated with bright bird motifs, turned toward Fast Man.</p>

<p><q>You're just saying that.</q></p>

<p>Fast Man swung himself up beside the runaway and settled into the little nest. Yemoa wiggled away as far as the cramped space would permit.</p>

<p><q>I didn't say you could come up here.</q></p>

<p><q>It's a free ship.</q></p>

<p><q>It's not <em>your</em> ship.</q></p>

<p><q>True,</q> said Fast Man. He crossed his legs and dimmed down his self-shine until they could both look out over the floodlit curve of the star drive works. The scalarity drive itself was a small unit&mdash;small by Amoa's vistas; merely the size of a well-established country manor. The heavy engineering that overshadowed it, the towering silos and domes and pipeworks, was the transfer system that converted water and antiwater into dark energy. Above all, the lampships hovered in habitat-stationary orbits, five small suns. Fast Man did not doubt that the site hived with desperate energy and activity, but to his Child Speed perceptions, it was as still as a painting, the figures in their bird-bright skinsuits, the heavy engineers in their long-duration work armor, the many robots and vehicles and little jetting skipcraft all frozen in time, moving so slowly that no individual motion was visible, but when you looked back, everything had changed. A long time even for a Parent, Fast Man sat with Yemoa. Beyond the construction lights, the stars arced past. How must they seem to the adults, Fast Man thought, and in that thought pushed down into Parent Speed and felt a breathless, deeply internalized gasp of wonder as the stars accelerated into curving streaks. The construction site ramped up into action, the little assembly robots and skippers darting here and there on little puffs of reaction gas.</p>

<p>Ten years, ten grown-up years, since Fast Man had osmosed through the hull and coalesced out of a column of motes onto the soil of Ga'atu Colony, and still he did not know which world he belonged to, Parent or Fast Children. There had been no Fast Children then, no children at all. That was the contract. When the Destination was reached, that was the time for children, born the old way, the fast way, properly adjusted to their new world. Fast Man had changed all that with the price of his rescue: the promise that the Destination could be reached not in slow years, not even in a slow season, but in hours-real hours. With a proviso: that they detour-a matter of moments to a relativistic fleet&mdash;to Fast Man's old home-world of Tay.</p>

<p>The meetings were concluded, the deal was struck, the Aeo Taea fleet's tight tight energy budget would allow it, just. It would mean biofuels and muscle power for the travelers; all tech resources diverted to assembling the three dark energy scalarity units. But the journey would be over in a single sleep. Then the generous forests and woodlands that carpeted the gently rolling midriffs of the colony cylinders all flowered and released genetweak pollen. Everyone got a cold for three days, everyone got pregnant, and nine Parent months later, the first of the Fast Children was born.</p>

<p><q>So where's your clip?</q></p>

<p>At the sound of Yemoa's voice, Fast Man geared up into Child Speed. The work on the dazzling plain froze; the stars slowed to a crawl.</p>

<p><q>I don't need one, do I?</q> Fast Man added, <q>I know exactly how big space is.</q></p>

<p><q>Does it really use dark energy?</q></p>

<p><q>It does.</q></p>

<p>Yemoa pulled his knees up to him, stiff from his long vigil in the absolute cold. A splinter of memory pierced Fast Man: the fast-frozen canals of Jann, the months-long dark. He shivered. Whose life was that, whose memory?</p>

<p><q>I read about dark energy. It's the force that makes the universe expand faster and faster, and everything in it, you, me, the distance between us. In the end, everything will accelerate away so fast from everything else that the universe will rip itself apart, right down to the quarks.</q></p>

<p><q>That's one theory.</q></p>

<p><q>Every particle will be so far from everything else that it will be in a universe of its own. It will <em>be</em> a universe of its own.</q></p>

<p><q>Like I said, it's a theory. Yemoa, your parents&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>You use this as a space drive.</q></p>

<p><q>Your matter-antimatter system obeys the laws of thermodynamics, and that's the heat-death of the universe. We're all getter older and colder and more and more distant. Come on, you have to come in. You must be uncomfortable in that suit.</q></p>

<p>The Aeo Taea skinsuits looked like flimsy dance costumes to don in the empty cold of interstellar space, but their hides were clever works of molecular technology, recycling and refreshing and repairing. Still, Fast Man could not contemplate the itch and reek of one after days of wear.</p>

<p><q>You can't be here on Starship Day,</q> Fast Man warned. <q>Particle density is very low out here, but it's still enough to fry you, at lightspeed.</q></p>

<p><q>We'll be the Slow ones then,</q> Yemoa said. <q>A few hours will pass for us, but in the outside universe, it will be fifty years.</q></p>

<p><q>It's all relative,</q> Fast Man said.</p>

<p><q>And when we get there,</q> Yemoa continued, <q>we'll unpack the landers and we'll go down and it'll be the new world, the big Des Tin Ay Shun, but our moms and dads, they'll stay up in the Three Worlds. And we'll work, and we'll build that new world, and we'll have our children, and they'll have children, and maybe we'll see another generation after that, but in the end, we'll die, and the Parents up there in the sky, they'll hardly have aged at all.</q></p>

<p>Fast Man draped his hands over his knees.</p>

<p><q>They love you, you know.</q></p>

<p><q>I know. I know that. It's not that at all. Did you think that? If you think that, you're stupid. What does everyone see in you if you think stuff like that? It's just&hellip; what's the point?</q></p>

<p><em>None</em>, Fast Man thought. <em>And everything. You are as much point as the universe needs, in your yellow and green skinsuit and mad-bird helmet and fine rage.</em></p>

<p><q>You know,</q> Fast Man said, <q>whatever you think about it, it's worse for them. It's worse than anything I think you can imagine. Everyone they love growing old in the wink of an eye, dying, and they can't touch them, they can't help, they're trapped up there. No, I think it's so very much worse for them.</q></p>

<p><q>Yah,</q> said Yemoa. He slapped his gloved hands on his thin knees. <q>You know, it is freezing up here.</q></p>

<p><q>Come on then.</q> Fast Man stood up and offered a silver hand. Yemoa took it. The stars curved overhead. Together, they climbed down from the aerial and walked back down over the curve of the world, back home.</p>

<h3 class="small-caps">Oga, Tearing</h3>

<p>He stood on the arch of the old Jemejnay bridge over the dead canal. Acid winds blew past him, shrieking on the honed edges of the shattered porcelain houses. The black sky crawled with suppressed lightning. The canal was a desiccated vein, cracked dry; even the centuries of trash wedged in its cracked silts had rusted away, under the bite of the caustic wind, to scabs and scales of slag. The lagoon was a dish of pure salt shimmering with heat haze. In natural light, it would have been blinding but no sun ever challenged the clouds. In Oga's extended vision, the old campanile across the lagoon was a snapped tooth of crumbling masonry.</p>

<p>A flurry of boiling acid rain swept over Oga as he turned away from the burning vista, from the dead stone arch, onto Ej-tay Quay. His motes sensed and changed mode on reflex, but not before a wash of pain burned through him. Feel it. It is punishment. It is good.</p>

<p>The houses were roofless, floorless; rotted snapped teeth of patinated ceramic: had been for eight hundred years. Drunken Chicken Street. Here Kentlay the Lonely had sat out in the sun and passed the time of day with his neighbors and visitors come for his gift. Here were the Dilmajs and the vile, cruel little son who had caught birds and pulled their feathers so that they could not fly from his needles and knives, street bully and fat boy. Mrs. Supris, a sea widow, a baker of cakes and sweets, a keeper of mournings and ocean leavings. All dead. Long dead, dead with their city, their world.</p>

<p>This must be a mock Ctarisphay, a stage, a set, a play city for some moral tale of a prodigal, an abandoner. A traitor. Memories turned to blasted, glowing stumps. A city of ruins. A world in ruins. There was no sea anymore. Only endless poisoned salt. This could not be true. Yet this was his house. The acid wind had not yet totally erased the carved squid that stood over the door. Oga reached up to touch it. It was hot, biting hot; everything was hot, baked to an infrared glow by runaway greenhouse effect. To Oga's carbon-shelled fingertips, it was a small stone prayer, a whisper caught in a shell. If the world had permitted tears, the old, eroded stone squid would have called Oga's. Here was the hall, here the private parlor, curved in on itself like a ceramic musical instrument. The stairs, the upper floors, everything organic had evaporated centuries ago, but he could still read the niches of the sleeping porches cast in the upper walls. How would it have been in the end days, when even the summer sky was black from burning oil? Slow, painful, as year upon year the summer temperatures rose and the plankton blooms, carefully engineered to absorb the carbon from Tay's oil riches, died and gave up their own sequestered carbon.</p>

<p>The winds keened through the dead city and out across the empty ocean. With a thought, Oga summoned the ship. Ion glow from the reentry shone through the clouds. Sonic booms rolled across the sterile lagoon and rang from the dead porcelain houses. The ship punched out of the cloud base and unfolded, a sheet of nanomotes that, to Oga's vision, called memories of the ancient Bazjendi angels stooping down the burning wind. The ship beat its wings over the shattered campanile, then dropped around Oga like a possession. Flesh melted, flesh ran and fused, systems meshed, selves merged. Newly incarnate, Oga kicked off from Ejtay Quay in a pillar of fusion fire. Light broke around the empty houses and plazas, sent shadows racing down the desiccated canals. The salt pan glared white, dwindling to the greater darkness as the light ascended. With a star at his feet, Oga punched up through the boiling acid clouds, up and out until, in his extended shipsight, he could see the infraglow of the planet's limb curve against space. A tear of blood. Accelerating, Oga broke orbit.</p>

<p>Oga. The name was a festival. Father-of-all-our-Mirths, in subtly inflected Aeo Taea. He was Fast Man no more, no longer a sojourner; he was Parent of a nation. The Clave had ordained three Parent Days of rejoicing as the Aeo Taea colony cylinders dropped out of scalarity drive at the edge of the system. For the children, it had been a month of party. Looking up from the flat end of the cylinder, Oga had felt the light from his native star on his skin, subtle and sensitive in a dozen spectra. He masked out the sun and looked for those sparks of reflected light that were worlds. There Saltpeer, and great Bephis: magnifying his vision, he could see its rings and many moons; there Tejaphay. It, too, wore a ring now; the shattered icy remnants of the An-preen Commonweal. And there; there: Tay. Home. Something not right about it. Something missing in its light. Oga had ratcheted up his sight to the highest magnification he could achieve in this form.</p>

<p>There was no water in the spectrum. There was no pale blue dot.</p>

<p>The Clave of Aeo Taea Interstellar Cantons received the message some hours after the surface crews registered the departure of the Anpreen splinter-ship in a glare of fusion light: I <em>have to go home.</em></p>

<p>From five AUs out, the story became brutally evident. Tay was a silver ball of unbroken cloud. Those clouds comprised carbon dioxide, carbonic, and sulfuric acid, and a memory of water vapor. The surface temperature read at two hundred and twenty degrees. Oga's ship-self possessed skills and techniques beyond his nonuniform self; he could see the perpetual lightning storms cracking cloud to cloud, but never a drop of pure rain. He could see through those clouds; he could peel them away so that the charred, parched surface of the planet lay open to his sight. He could map the outlines of the continents and the continental shelves lifting from the dried ocean. The chains of archipelagos, once jewels around the belly of a beautiful dancer, were ribs, bones, stark mountain chains glowing furiously in the infradark.</p>

<p>As he fell sunward, Oga put the story together. The Enemy had struck Tay casually, almost as an afterthought. A lone warship, little larger than the ritual catamaran on which the boy called Ptey had sailed from this quay so many centuries before, had detached itself from the main fleet action and swept the planet with its particle weapons, a spray of directed fire that set the oil fields burning. Then it looped carelessly back out of the system, leaving a world to suffocate. They had left the space elevator intact. There must be a way out. This was judgment, not murder. Yet two billion people, two thirds of the planet's population, had died.</p>

<p>One third had lived. One third swarmed up the life-rope of the space elevator and looked out at space and wondered where they could go. Where they went, Oga went now. He could hear their voices, a low em-band chitter from the big blue of Tejaphay. His was a long, slow chasing loop. It would be the better part of a year before he arrived in parking orbit above Tejaphay. Time presented its own distractions and seductions. The quantum array that was his heart could as easily re-create Tay as any of scores of cultures it stored. The midday aurora would twist and glimmer again above the steep-gabled roofs of Jann. He would fish with Cjatay from the old, weather-silvered fishing stands for the spring run of prith. The Sulanj islands would simmer and bask under the midnight sun and Puzhay would again nuzzle against him and press her body close against the hammering cold outside the Tea Lane Ladyhearth walls. They all could live, they all would believe they lived, <em>he</em> could, by selective editing of his consciousness, believe they lived again. He could re-create dead Tay. But it was the game of a god, a god who could take off his omniscience and enter his own delusion, and so Oga chose to press his perception down into a time flow even slower than Parent Time and watch the interplay of gravity wells around the sun.</p>

<p>On the final weeks of approach, Oga returned to world time and opened his full sensory array on the big planet that hung tantalizingly before him. He had come here before, when the Anpreen Commonweal hung around Tejaphay like pearls, but then he had given the world beneath him no thought, being inside a world complete in itself, and his curiosity turned outward to the shape of the universe. Now he beheld Tejaphay and remembered awe. Three times the diameter of Tay, Tejaphay was the true water world now. Ocean covered it pole to pole, a hundred kilometers deep. Immense weather systems mottled the planet, white on blue. The surviving spine of the Anpreen space elevator pierced the eye of a perpetual equatorial storm system. Wave trains and swells ran unbroken from equator to pole to smash in stupendous breakers against the polar ice caps. Oga drew near in sea meditation. Deep ocean appalled him in a way that centuries of time and space had not. That was distance. This was hostility. This was elementary fury that knew nothing of humanity.</p>

<p>Yet life clung here. Life survived. From two light-minutes out, Oga had heard a whisper of radio communication, from the orbit station on the space elevator, also from the planet's surface. Scanning sub-Antarctic waters, he caught the unmistakable tang of smart-ice. A closer look: what had on first glance seemed to be bergs revealed a more complex structure: Spires, buttresses, domes, and sprawling terraces. Ice cities, riding the perpetual swell. Tay was not forgotten: these were the ancient Manifold Houses reborn, grown to the scale of vast Tejaphay. Closer again: the berg city under his scrutiny floated at the center of a much larger boomed circle. Oga's senses teemed with life signs. This was a complete ecosystem, and ocean farm, and Oga began to appreciate what these refugees had undertaken. No glimpse of life had ever been found on Tejaphay. Water-worlds, thawed from ice giants sent spiraling sunward by the gravitational play of their larger planetary rivals, were sterile. At the bottom of the hundred-kilometer-deep ocean was pressure ice, five thousand kilometers of pressure ice down to the iron core. No minerals, no carbon ever percolated up through that deep ice. Traces might arrive by cometary impact, but the waters of Tejaphay were deep and pure. What the Taynish had, the Taynish had brought. Even this ice city was grown from the shattered remnants of the Anpreen Commonweal.</p>

<p>A hail from the elevator station, a simple language algorithm. Oga smiled to himself as he compared the vocabulary files to his own memory of his native tongue. Half a millennium had changed the pronunciation and many of the words of Taynish, but not its inner subtleties, the rhythmic and contextual clues as to which Aspect was speaking.</p>

<p><q>Attention unidentified ship, this is Tejaphay Orbital Tower approach control. Please identify yourself and your flight plan.</q></p>

<p><q>This is the Oga of the Aeo Taea Interstellar Fleet.</q> He toyed with replying in the archaic speech. Worse than a breach of etiquette, such a conceit might give away information he did not wish known. Yet. <q>I am a representative with authority to negotiate. We wish to enter into communications with your government regarding fueling rights in this system.</q></p>

<p><q>Hello, Oga, this is Tejaphay Orbital Tower. By the Aeo Taea Interstellar Fleet, I assume you refer to these objects.</q> A subchatter on the data channel identified the cylinders, coasting in-system. Oga confirmed.</p>

<p><q>Hello, Oga, Tejaphay Tower. Do not, repeat, do not approach the Tower docking station. Attain this orbit and maintain until you have been contacted by Tower security. Please confirm your acceptance.</q></p>

<p>It was a reasonable request, and Oga's subtler senses picked up missile foramens unfolding in the shadows of the Orbital Station solar array. He was a runner, not a fighter; Tejaphay's defenses might be basic fusion warheads and would need sustained precision hits to split open the Aeo Taea colony cans, but they were more than a match for Oga without the fuel reserves for full scalarity drive.</p>

<p><q>I confirm that.</q></p>

<p>As he looped up to the higher ground, Oga studied more closely the berg cities of Tejaphay, chips of ice in the monstrous ocean. It would be a brutal life down there under two gravities, every aspect of life subject to the melting ice and the enclosing circle of the biosphere boom. Everything beyond that was as lifeless as space. The horizon would be huge and far and empty. City ships might sail for lifetimes without meeting another polis. The Taynish were tough. They were a race of the extremes. Their birthworld and its severe seasonal shifts had called forth a social response that other cultures would regard as mental disease, as socialized schizophrenia. Those multiple Aspects-a self for every need-now served them on the hostile vastnesses of Te-japhay's world ocean. They would survive, they would thrive. Life endured. This was the great lesson of the Clade: that life was hope, the only hope of escaping the death of the universe.</p>

<p><q><em>Every particle will be so far from everything else that it will be in a universe of its own. It will be a universe of its own</em>,</q> a teenage boy in a yellow spacesuit had said up on the hull of mighty <em>Amoa</em>, looking out on the space between the stars. Oga had not answered at that time. It would have scared the boy, and though he had discovered it himself on the long flight from Milius 1183, he did not properly understand it himself, and in that gap of comprehension, he, too, was afraid. <em>Yes</em>, he would have said. <em>And in that is our only hope.</em></p>

<p>Long-range sensors chimed. A ship had emerged around the limb of the planet. Consciousness is too slow a tool for the pitiless mathematics of space. In the split second that the ship's course, design, and drive signature had registered on Oga's higher cognitions, his autonomic systems had plotted course and fuel reserves, and engaged the scalarity drive. At a thousand gees, he pulled away from Tejaphay. Manipulating space-time so close to the planet would send gravity waves rippling through it like a struck gong. Enormous slow tides would circle the globe; the space elevator would flex like a crackled whip. Nothing to be done. It was instinct alone and by instinct he lived, for here came the missiles. Twenty nanotoc warheads on hypergee drives, wiping out his entire rearward vision in a white glare of lightweight MaM engines, but not before he had felt on his skin sensors the unmistakable harmonies of an Enemy deep-space scoopfield going up.</p>

<p>The missiles had the legs, but Oga had the stamina. He had calculated it thus. The numbers still came to him. Looking back at the blue speck into which Tejaphay had dwindled, he saw the engine sparks of the missiles wink out one after the other. And now he could be sure that the strategy, devised in nanoseconds, would pay off. The warship was chasing him. He would lead it away from the Aeo Taea fleet. But this would be no long stern chase over the light-decades. He did not have the fuel for that, nor the inclination. Without fuel, without weapons, he knew he must end it. For that, he needed space.</p>

<p>It was the same ship. The drive field harmonics, the spectrum of the fusion flame, the timbre of the radar images that he so gently, kiss-soft, bounced off the pursuer's hull, even the configuration he had glimpsed as the ship rounded the planet and launched missiles. This was the same ship that had hunted him down all the years. Deep mysteries here. Time dilation would compress his planned course to subjective minutes and Oga needed time to find an answer.</p>

<p>The ship had known where he would go even as they bucked the stormy cape of the wandering neutron star. It had never even attempted to follow him; instead, it had always known that it must lay in a course that would whip it around to Tay. That meant that even as he escaped the holocaust at Milius 1183, it had known who he was, where he came from, had seen through the frozen layers of smart-ice to the Torben below. The ship had come from around the planet. It was an enemy ship, but not the Enemy. They would have boiled Tejaphay down to its iron heart. Long Oga contemplated these things as he looped out into the wilderness of the Oort cloud. Out there among the lonely ice, he reached a conclusion. He turned the ship over and burned the last of his reaction in a hypergee deceleration burn. The enemy ship responded immediately, but its ramjet drive was less powerful. It would be months, years even, before it could turn around to match orbits with him. He would be ready then. The edge of the field brushed Oga as he decelerated at fifteen hundred gravities and he used his external sensors to modulate a message on the huge web, a million kilometers across: <em>I surrender.</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>Gigayears ago, before the star was born, the two comets had met and entered into their far, cold marriage. Beyond the dramas and attractions of the dust cloud that coalesced into Tay and Tejaphay and Bephis, all the twelve planets of the solar system, they maintained their fixed-grin gazes on each other, locked in orbit around a mutual center of gravity where a permanent free-floating haze of ice crystals hovered, a fraction of a Kelvin above absolute zero. Hidden among them, and as cold and seemingly as dead, was the splintership. Oga shivered. The cold was more than physical&mdash;on the limits of even his malleable form. Within their thermal casing, his motes moved as slowly as Aeo Taea Parents. He felt old as this ice and as weary. He looked up into the gap between ice worlds. The husband-comet floated above his head like a halo. He could have leaped to it in a thought.</p>

<p>Lights against the starlight twinkle of the floating ice storm. A sudden occlusion. The Enemy was here. Oga waited, feeling every targeting sensor trained on him.</p>

<p><em>No, you won't, will you? Because you have to know.</em></p>

<p>A shadow detached itself from the black ship, darkest on dark, and looped around the comet. It would be a parliament of self-assembling motes like himself. Oga had worked out decades before that Enemy and Anpreen were one and the same, sprung from the same nanotechnological seed when they attained Class Two status. Theirs was a civil war. <em>In the Clade, all war was civil war</em>, Oga thought. Panhumanity was all there was. More like a family feud. Yes, those were the bloodiest fights of all. No quarter and no forgiveness.</p>

<p>The man came walking around the small curve of the comet, kicking up shards of ice crystals from his grip soles. Oga recognized him. He was meant to. He had designed himself so that he would be instantly recognizable, too. He bowed, in the distances of the Oort cloud.</p>

<p><q>Torben Reris Orhum Fejannen Kekjay Prus Rejmer Sere-jen Nejben, sir.</q></p>

<p>The briefest nod of a head, a gesture of hours in the slow-motion hypercold.</p>

<p><q>Torben. I'm not familiar with that name.</q></p>

<p><q>Perhaps we should use the name most familiar to you. That would be Serejen, or perhaps Fejannen. I was in that Aspect when we last met. I would have hoped you still remembered the old etiquette.</q></p>

<p><q>I find I remember too much these days. Forgetting is a choice since I was improved. And a chore. What do they call you now?</q></p>

<p><q>Oga.</q></p>

<p><q>Oga it shall be, then.</q></p>

<p><q>And what do they call <em>you</em> now?</q></p>

<p>The man looked up into the icy gap between worldlets. <em>He has remembered himself well</em>, Oga thought. <em>The slight portliness, the child-chubby features, like a boy who never grew up. As he says, forgetting is a chore.</em></p>

<p><q>The same thing they always have: Cjatay.</q></p>

<p><q>Tell me your story then, Cjatay. This was never your fight, or my fight.</q></p>

<p><q>You left her.</q></p>

<p><q>She left <em>me</em>, I recall, and, like you, I forget very little these days. I can see the note still; I could re-create it for you, but it would be a scandalous waste of energy and resources. She went to you.</q></p>

<p><q>It was never me. It was the cause.</q></p>

<p><q>Do you truly believe that?</q></p>

<p>Cjatay gave a glacial shrug.</p>

<p><q>We made independent contact with them when they came. The Council of governments was divided, all over the place, no coherent approach or strategy. <q>Leave us alone. We're not part of this.</q> But there's no neutrality in these things. We had let them use our system's water. We had the space elevator they built for us, there was the price, there was the blood money. We knew it would never work-our hope was that we could convince them that some of us had always stood against the Anpreen. They torched Tay anyway, but they gave us a deal. They'd let us survive as a species if some of us joined them on their crusade.</q></p>

<p><q>They <em>are</em> the Anpreen.</q></p>

<p><q><em>Were</em> the Anpreen. I know. They took me to pieces. They made us into something else. Better, I think. All of us, there were twenty-four of us. Twenty-four, that was all the good people of Tay, in their eyes. Everyone who was worth saving.</q></p>

<p><q>And Puzhay?</q></p>

<p><q>She died. She was caught in the Arphan conflagration. She went there from Jann to be with her parents. It always was an oil town. They melted it to slag.</q></p>

<p><q>But you blame me.</q></p>

<p><q>You are all that's left.</q></p>

<p><q>I don't believe that. I think it was always personal. I think it was always revenge.</q></p>

<p><q>You still exist.</q></p>

<p><q>That's because you don't have all the answers yet.</q></p>

<p><q>We know the kind of creatures we've become; what answers can I not know?</q></p>

<p>Oga dipped his head, then looked up to the halo moon, so close he could almost touch it.</p>

<p><q>Do you want me to show you what they fear so much?</q></p>

<p>There was no need for the lift of the hand, the conjurer's gesture; the pieces of his ship-self that Oga had seeded so painstakingly through the wife-comet's structure were part of his extended body. <em>But I do make magic here</em>, he thought. He dropped his hand. The star-speckled sky turned white, hard painful white, as if the light of every star were arriving at once. <em>An Others sky</em>, Oga remembered from his days in the turrets and cloisters of Jann. And as the light grew intolerable, it ended. Blackness, embedding, huge and comforting. The dark of death. Then Oga's eyes grew familiar with the dark, and, though it was the plan and always had been the plan, he felt a plaint of awe as he saw ten thousand galaxies resolve out of the Olbers dazzle. And he knew that Cjatay saw the same.</p>

<p><q>Where are we? What have you done?</q></p>

<p><q>We are somewhere in the region of two hundred and thirty million light-years outside our local group of galaxies, more precisely, on the periphery of the cosmological galactic super-cluster known as the Great Attractor. I made some refinements to the scalarity drive unit to operate in a one-dimensional array.</q></p>

<p><q>Faster-than-light travel,</q> Cjatay said, his upturned face silvered with the light of the ten thousand galaxies of the Great Attractor.</p>

<p><q>No, you still don't see it,</q> Oga said, and again turned the universe white. Now when he flicked out of hyperscalarity, the sky was dark and starless but for three vast streams of milky light that met in a triskelion hundreds of millions of light-years across.</p>

<p><q>We are within the Bootes Supervoid,</q> Oga said. <q>It is so vast that if our own galaxy were in the center of it, we would have thought ourselves alone and that our galaxy was the entire universe. Before us are the Lyman alpha-blobs, three conjoined galaxy filaments. These are the largest structures in the universe. On scales larger than this, structure becomes random and grainy. We become gray. These are the last grand vistas. This is the end of greatness.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course, the expansion of space is not limited by light-speed,</q> Cjatay said.</p>

<p><q>Still you don't understand.</q> A third time, Oga generated the dark energy from the ice beneath his feet and focused it into a narrow beam between the wife-comet and its unimaginably distant husband. <em>Two particles in contact will remain in quantum entanglement no matter how far they are removed</em>, Oga thought. <em>And is that true also for lives? He</em> dismissed the scalarity generator and brought them out in blackness. Complete, impenetrable, all-enfolding blackness, without a photon of light.</p>

<p><q>Do you understand where I have brought you?</q></p>

<p><q>You've taken us beyond the visible horizon,</q> Cjatay said.</p>

<p><q>You've pushed space so far that the light from the rest of the universe has not had time to reach us. We are isolated from every other part of reality. In a philosophical sense, we are a universe in ourselves.</q></p>

<p><q>That was what they feared? You feared?</q></p>

<p><q>That the scalarity drive had the potential to be turned into a weapon of unimaginable power? Oh yes. The ability to remove any enemy from reach, to banish them beyond the edge of the universe. To exile them from the universe itself, instantly and irrevocably.</q></p>

<p><q>Yes, I can understand that, and that you did what you did altruistically. They were moral genocides. But our intention was never to use it as a weapon&mdash;if it had been, wouldn't we have used it on you?</q></p>

<p>Silence in the darkness beyond dark.</p>

<p><q>Explain then.</q></p>

<p><q>I have one more demonstration.</q></p>

<p>The mathematics were critical now. The scalarity generator devoured cometary mass voraciously. If there were not enough left to allow him to return them home&hellip; Trust number, Oga. You always have. Beyond the edge of the universe, all you have is number. There was no sensation, no way of perceiving when he activated and deactivated the scalarity field, except by number. For an instant, Oga feared number had failed him, a first and fatal betrayal. Then light blazed down onto the dark ice. A single blinding star shone in the absolute blackness.</p>

<p><q>What is that?</q></p>

<p><q>I pushed a single proton beyond the horizon of this horizon. I pushed it so far that space and time tore.</q></p>

<p><q>So I'm looking at-</q></p>

<p><q>The light of creation. That is an entire universe, newborn. A new big bang. A young man once said to me, <q>Every particle will be so far from everything else that it will be in a universe of its own. It will <em>be</em> a universe of its own.</q> An extended object like this comet, or bodies, is too gross, but in a single photon, quantum fluctuations will turn it into an entire universe-in-waiting.</q></p>

<p>The two men looked up a long time into the nascent light, the surface of the fireball seething with physical laws and forces boiling out. <em>Now you understand</em>, Oga thought. <em>It's not a weapon. It's the way out. The way past the death of the universe. Out there beyond the horizon, we can bud off new universes, and universes from those universes, forever. Intelligence has the last word. We won't die alone in the cold and the dark.</em> He felt the light of the infant universe on his face, then said, <q>I think we probably should be getting back. If my calculations are correct-and there is a significant margin of error-this fireball will shortly undergo a phase transition as dark energy separates out and undergoes catastrophic expansion. I don't think that the environs of an early universe would be a very good place for us to be.</q></p>

<p>He saw portly Cjatay smile.</p>

<p><q>Take me home, then. I'm cold and I'm tired of being a god.</q></p>

<p><q>Are we gods?</q></p>

<p>Cjatay nodded at the micro verse.</p>

<p><q>I think so. No, I know I would want to be a man again.</q></p>

<p>Oga thought of his own selves and lives, his bodies and natures. Flesh indwelled by many personalities, then one personality-one aggregate of experience and memory-in bodies liquid, starship, nanotechnological. And he <em>was</em> tired, so terribly tired beyond the universe, centuries away from all that he had known and loved. All except this one, his enemy.</p>

<p><q>Tejaphay is no place for children.</q></p>

<p><q>Agreed. We could rebuild Tay.</q></p>

<p><q>It would be a work of centuries.</q></p>

<p><q>We could use the Aeo Taea Parents. They have plenty of time.</q></p>

<p>Now Cjatay laughed.</p>

<p><q>I have to trust you now, don't I? I could have vaporized you back there, blown this place to atoms with my missiles. And now you create an entire universe.</q></p>

<p><q>And the Enemy? They'll come again.</q></p>

<p><q>You'll be ready for them, like you were ready for me. After all, I am still the enemy.</q></p>

<p>The surface of the bubble of universe seemed to be in more frenetic motion now. The light was dimming fast.</p>

<p><q>Let's go then,</q> Cjatay said.</p>

<p><q>Yes,</q> Oga said. <q>Let's go home.</q></p>
