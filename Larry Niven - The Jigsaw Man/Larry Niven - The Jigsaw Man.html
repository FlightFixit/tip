<h1>The Jigsaw Man</h1>
<h2>by Larry Niven</h2>

<p>In A.D. 1900 Karl Landsteiner classified human blood into four types: A, B, AB, and O, according to incompatibilities. For the first time it became possible to give a shock patient a transfusion with some hope that it wouldn't kill him.</p>

<p>The movement to abolish the death penalty was barely getting started, and already it was doomed.</p>

<p>Vh83uOAGn7 was his telephone number and his driving license number and his social security number and the number of his draft card and his medical record. Two of these had been revoked, and the others had ceased to matter, except for his medical record. His name was Warren Lewis Knowles. He was going to die.</p>

<p>The trial was a day away, but the verdict was no less certain for that. Lew was guilty. If anyone had doubted it, the persecution had ironclad proof. By eighteen tomorrow Lew would be condemned to death. Broxton would appeal the case on some grounds or other. The appeal would be denied.</p>

<p>His cell was comfortable, small, and padded. This was no slur on the prisoner's sanity, though insanity was no longer an excuse for breaking the law. Three of the walls were mere bars. The fourth wall, the outside wall, was cement painted a restful shade of green. But the bars which separated him from the corridor, and from the morose old man on his left, and from the big, moronic-looking teenager on his right—the bars were four inches thick and eight inches apart, padded in silicone plastic. For the fourth time that day Lew took a clenched fistful of the plastic and tried to rip it away. It felt like a sponge rubber pillow, with a rigid core the thickness of a pencil, and it wouldn't rip. When he let go it snapped back to a perfect cylinder.</p>

<p><q>It's not fair,</q> he said.</p>

<p>The teenager didn't move. For all of the ten hours Lew had been in his cell, the kid had been sitting on the edge of his bunk with his lank black hair falling in his eyes and his five o'clock shadow getting gradually darker. He moved his long, hairy arms only at mealtimes, and the rest of him not at all.</p>

<p>The old man looked up at the sound of Lew's voice. He spoke with bitter sarcasm. <q>You framed?</q></p>

<p><q>No, I—</q></p>

<p><q>At least you're honest. What'd you do?</q></p>

<p>Lew told him. He couldn't keep the hurt innocence out of his voice. The old man smiled derisively, nodding as if he'd expected just that.</p>

<p><q>Stupidity. Stupidity's always been a capital crime. If you <i>had</i> to get yourself executed, why not for something important? See the kid on the other side of you?</q></p>

<p><q>Sure,</q> Lew said without looking.</p>

<p><q>He's an organlegger.</q></p>

<p>Lew felt the shock freezing in his face. He braced himself for another look into the next cell—and every nerve in his body jumped. The kid was looking at him. With his dull dark eyes barely visible under his mop of hair, he regarded Lew as a butcher might consider a badly aged side of beef.</p>

<p>Lew edged closer to the bars between his cell and the old man's. His voice was a hoarse whisper. <q>How many did he kill?</q></p>

<p><q>None.</q></p>

<p><q>?</q></p>

<p><q>He was the snatch man. He'd find someone out alone at night, drug the prospect and take him home to the doc that ran the ring. It was the doc that did all the killing. If Bernie'd brought home a dead prospect, the doc would have skinned <i>him</i> down.</q></p>

<p>The old man sat with Lew almost directly behind him. He had twisted himself around to talk to Lew, but now he seemed to be losing interest. His hands, hidden from Lew by his bony back, were in constant nervous motion.</p>

<p><q>How many did he snatch?</q></p>

<p><q>Four. Then he got caught. He's not very bright, Bernie.</q></p>

<p><q>What did you do to get put here?</q></p>

<p>The old man didn't answer. He ignored Lew completely, his shoulders twitching as he moved his hands. Lew shrugged and dropped back on his bunk.</p>

<p>It was nineteen o'clock of a Thursday night.</p>

<p>The ring had included three snatch men. Bernie had not yet been tried. Another was dead; he had escaped over the edge of a pedwalk when he felt the mercy bullet enter his arm. The third was being wheeled into the hospital next door to the courthouse.</p>

<p>Officially he was still alive. He had been sentenced; his appeal had been denied; but he was still alive as they moved him, drugged, into the operating room.</p>

<p>The interns lifted him from the table and inserted a mouthpiece so he could breathe when they dropped him into freezing liquid. They lowered him without a splash, and as his body temperature went down they dribbled something else into his veins. About half a pint of it. His temperature dropped toward freezing, his heartbeats were further and further apart. Finally his heart stopped. But it could have been started again. Men had been reprieved at this point. Officially the organlegger was still alive.</p>

<p>The doctor was a line of machines with a conveyor belt running through them. When the organlegger's body temperature reached a certain point, the belt started. The first machine made a series of incisions in his chest. Skillfully and mechanically, the doctor performed a cardiectomy.</p>

<p>The organlegger was officially dead. His heart went into storage immediately. His skin followed, most of it in one piece, all of it still living. The doctor took him apart with exquisite care, like disassembling a flexible, fragile, tremendously complex jigsaw puzzle. The brain was flashburned and the ashes saved for urn burial; but all the rest of the body, in slabs and small blobs and parchment-thin layers and lengths of tubing, went into storage in the hospital's organ banks. Any one of these units could be packed in a travel case at a moment's notice and flown to anywhere in the world in not much more than an hour. If the odds broke right, if the right people came down with the right diseases at the right time, the organlegger might save more lives than he had taken.</p>

<p>Which was the whole point.</p>

<p>Lying on his back, staring up at the ceiling television set, Lew suddenly began to shiver. He had not had the energy to put the sound plug in his ear, and the silent motion of the cartoon figures had suddenly become horrid. He turned the set off, and that didn't help either.</p>

<p>Bit by bit they would take him apart and store him away. He'd never seen an organ storage bank, but his uncle had owned a butcher-shop&hellip;.</p>

<p><q>Hey!</q> he yelled.</p>

<p>The kid's eyes came up, the only living part of him. The old man twisted round to look over his shoulder. At the end of the hall the guard looked up once, then went back to reading.</p>

<p>The fear was in Lew's belly; it pounded in his throat. <q>How can you stand it?</q></p>

<p>The kid's eyes dropped to the floor. The old man said, <q>Stand what?</q></p>

<p><q>Don't you know what they're going to <i>do</i> to us?</q></p>

<p><q>Not to me. They won't take me apart like a hog.</q></p>

<p>Instantly Lew was at the bars. <q>Why not?</q></p>

<p>The old man's voice had become very low. <q>Because there's a bomb where my right thighbone used to be. I'm gonna blow myself up. What they find, they'll never use.</q></p>

<p>The hope the old man had raised washed away, leaving bitterness. <q>Nuts. How could you put a bomb in your leg?</q></p>

<p><q>Take the bone out, bore a hole in it, build the bomb in the hole, get all the organic material out of the bone so it won't rot, put the bone back in. ‘Course your red corpuscle count goes down afterward. What I wanted to ask you. You want to join me?</q></p>

<p><q>Join you?</q></p>

<p><q>Hunch up against the bars. This thing'll take care of both of us.</q></p>

<p>Lew found himself backing away. <q>No. No, thanks.</q></p>

<p><q>Your choice,</q> said the old man. <q>I never told you what I was here for, did I? I was the doc. Bernie made his snatches for me.</q></p>

<p>Lew had backed up against the opposite set of bars. He felt them touch his shoulders and turned to find the kid looking dully into his eyes from two feet away. Organleggers! He was surrounded by professional killers!</p>

<p><q>I know what it's like,</q> the old man continued. <q>They won't do that to me. Well. If you're sure you don't want a clean death, go lie down behind your bunk. It's thick enough.</q></p>

<p>The bunk was a mattress and a set of springs mounted into a cement block which was an integral part of the cement floor. Lew curled himself into fetal position with his hands over his eyes.</p>

<p>He was sure he didn't want to die <i>now</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p>After a while he opened his eyes, took his hands away and looked around.</p>

<p>The kid was looking at him. For the first time there was a sour grin plastered on his face. In the corridor the guard, who was always in a chair by the exit, was standing outside the bars looking down at him. He seemed concerned.</p>

<p>Lew felt the flush rising in his neck and nose and ears. The old man had been playing with him. He moved to get up&hellip;</p>

<p>And a hammer came down on the world.</p>

<p>The guard lay broken against the bars of the cell across the corridor. The lank-haired youngster was picking himself up from behind his bunk, shaking his head. Somebody groaned; and the groan rose to a scream. The air was full of cement dust.</p>

<p>Lew got up.</p>

<p>Blood lay like red oil on every surface that faced the explosion. Try as he might, and he didn't try very hard, Lew could find no other trace of the old man.</p>

<p>Except for the hole in the wall.</p>

<p>He must have been standing &hellip; right &hellip; there.</p>

<p>The hole would be big enough to crawl through, if Lew could reach it. But it was in the old man's cell. The silicone plastic sheathing on the bars between the cells had been ripped away, leaving only pencil-thick lengths of metal.</p>

<p>Lew tried to squeeze through.</p>

<p>The bars were humming, vibrating, though there was no sound. As Lew noticed the vibration he also found that he was becoming sleepy. He jammed his body between the bars, caught in a war between his rising panic and the sonic stunners which must have gone on automatically.</p>

<p>The bars wouldn't give. But his body did; and the bars were slippery with &hellip; He was through. He poked his head through the hole in the wall and looked down.</p>

<p>Way down. Far enough to make him dizzy.</p>

<p>The Topeka County courthouse was a small skyscraper, and Lew's cell must have been near the top. He looked down a smooth concrete slab studded with windows set flush with the sides. There would be no way to reach those windows, no way to open them, no way to break them.</p>

<p>The stunner was sapping his will. He would have been unconscious by now if his head had been in the cell with the rest of him. He had to force himself to turn and look up.</p>

<p>He was <i>at</i> the top. The edge of the roof was only a few feet above his eyes. He couldn't reach that far, not without&hellip;</p>

<p>He began to crawl out of the hole.</p>

<p>Win or lose, they wouldn't get him for the organ banks. The vehicular traffic level would smash every useful part of him. He sat on the lip of the hole, with his legs straight out inside the cell for balance, pushing his chest flat against the wall. When he had his balance he stretched his arms toward the roof. No good.</p>

<p>So he got one leg under him, keeping the other stiffly out, and <i>lunged</i>.</p>

<p>His hands closed over the edge as he started to fall back. He yelped with surprise, but it was too late. The top of the courthouse was moving! It had dragged him out of the hole before he could let go. He hung on, swinging slowly back and forth over empty space as the motion carried him away.</p>

<p>The top of the courthouse was a pedwalk.</p>

<p>He couldn't climb up, not without purchase for his feet. He didn't have the strength. The pedwalk was moving toward another building, about the same height. He could reach it if he only hung on.</p>

<p>And the windows in that building were different. They weren't made to open, not in these days of smog and air conditioning, but there were ledges. Perhaps the glass would break.</p>

<p>Perhaps it wouldn't.</p>

<p>The pull on his arms was agony. It would be so easy to let go&hellip;. No. He had committed no crime worth dying for. He refused to die.</p>

<p>Over the decades of the twentieth century the movement continued to gain momentum. Loosely organized, international in scope, its members had only one goal: to replace execution with imprisonment and rehabilitation in every state and nation they could reach. They argued that killing a man for his crime teaches him nothing; that it serves as no deterrent to others who might commit the same crime; that death is irreversible, whereas an innocent man might be released from prison once his innocence is belatedly proven. Killing a man serves no good purpose, they said, unless for society's vengeance. Vengeance, they said, is unworthy of an enlightened society.</p>

<p>Perhaps they were right.</p>

<p>In 1940 Karl Landsteiner and Alexander S. Wiener made public their report on the Rh factor in human blood.</p>

<p>By mid-century most convicted killers were getting life imprisonment or less. Many were later returned to society, some <q>rehabilitated,</q> others not. The death penalty had been passed for kidnaping in some states, but it was hard to persuade a jury to enforce it. Similarly with murder charges. A man wanted for burglary in Canada and murder in California fought extradition to Canada; he had less chance of being convicted in California. Many states had abolished the death penalty. France had none.</p>

<p>Rehabilitation of criminals was a major goal of the science/art of psychology.</p>

<p>But—</p>

<p>Blood banks were world wide.</p>

<p>Already men and women with kidney diseases had been saved by a kidney transplanted from an identical twin. Not all kidney victims had identical twins. A doctor in Paris used transplants from close relatives, classifying up to a hundred points of incompatibility to judge in advance how successful the transplant would be.</p>

<p>Eye transplants were common. An eye donor could wait until he died before he saved another man's sight.</p>

<p>Human bone could <i>always</i> be transplanted, provided the bone was first cleaned of organic matter.</p>

<p>So matters stood at midcentury.</p>

<p>By 1990 it was possible to store any living human organ for any reasonable length of time. Transplants had become routine, helped along by the <q>scalpel of infinite thinness,</q> the laser. The dying regularly willed their remains to the organ banks. The mortuary lobbies couldn't stop it. But such gifts from the dead were not always useful.</p>

<p>In 1993 Vermont passed the first of the organ bank laws. Vermont had always had the death penalty. Now a condemned man could know that his death would save lives. It was no longer true that an execution served no good purpose. Not in Vermont.</p>

<p>Nor, later, in California. Or Washington. Georgia. Pakistan, England, Switzerland, France, Rhodesia&hellip;</p>

<p>The pedwalk was moving at ten miles per hour. Below, unnoticed by pedestrians who had quit work late and night owls who were just beginning their rounds, Lewis Knowles hung from the moving strip and watched the ledge go by beneath his dangling feet. The ledge was no more than two feet wide, a good four feet beneath his stretching toes.</p>

<p>He dropped.</p>

<p>As his feet struck he caught the edge of a window casement. Momentum jerked at him, but he didn't fall. After a long moment he breathed again.</p>

<p>He couldn't know what building this was, but it was not deserted. At twenty-one hundred at night, all the windows were ablaze. He tried to stay back out of the light as he peered in.</p>

<p>This window was an office. Empty.</p>

<p>He'd need something to wrap around his hand to break that window. But all he was wearing was a pair of shoesocks and a prison jumper. Well, he couldn't be more conspicuous than he was now. He took off the jumper, wrapped part of it around his hand, and struck.</p>

<p>He almost broke his hand.</p>

<p>Well &hellip; they'd let him keep his jewelry, his wristwatch and diamond ring. He drew a circle on the glass with the ring, pushing down hard, and struck again with the other hand. It <i>had</i> to be glass; if it was plastic he was doomed. The glass popped out in a near-perfect circle.</p>

<p>He had to do it six times before the hole was big enough for him.</p>

<p>He smiled as he stepped inside, still holding his jumper. Now all he needed was an elevator. The cops would have picked him up in an instant if they'd caught him on the street in a prison jumper, but if he hid the jumper here he'd be safe. Who would suspect a licensed nudist?</p>

<p>Except that he didn't have a license. Or a nudist's shoulder pouch to put it in.</p>

<p>Or a shave.</p>

<p>That was very bad. Never had there been a nudist as hairy as this. Not just a five o'clock shadow, but a full beard all over, so to speak. Where could he get a razor?</p>

<p>He tried the desk drawers. Many businessmen kept spare razors. He stopped when he was halfway through. Not because he'd found a razor, but because he now knew where he was. The papers on his desk made it all too obvious.</p>

<p>A hospital.</p>

<p>He was still clutching the jumper. He dropped it in the wastebasket, covered it tidily with papers, and more or less collapsed into the chair behind the desk.</p>

<p>A hospital. He <i>would</i> pick a hospital. And <i>this</i> hospital, the one which had been built right next to the Topeka County courthouse, for good and sufficient reason.</p>

<p>But he hadn't picked it, not really. It had picked him. Had he ever in his life made a decision except on the prompting of others? No. Friends had borrowed his money for keeps, men had stolen his girls, he had avoided promotion by his knack for being ignored. Shirley had bullied him into marrying her, then left him four years later for a friend who wouldn't be bullied.</p>

<p>Even now, at the possible end of his life, it was the same. An aging body snatcher had given him his escape. An engineer had built the cell bars wide enough apart to let a small man squeeze between them. Another had put a pedwalk along two convenient roofs. And here he was.</p>

<p>The worst of it was that here he had no chance of masquerading as a nudist. Hospital gowns and masks would be the minimum. Even nudists had to wear clothing sometime.</p>

<p>The closet?</p>

<p>There was nothing in the closet but a spiffy green hat and a perfectly transparent rain poncho.</p>

<p>He could run for it. If he could find a razor he'd be safe once he reached the street. He bit at a knuckle, wishing he knew where the elevator was. Have to trust to luck. He began searching the drawers again.</p>

<p>He had his hand on a black leather razor case when the door opened. A beefy man in a hospital gown breezed in. The intern (there were no human doctors in hospitals) was halfway to the desk before he noticed Lew crouching over an open drawer. He stopped walking. His mouth fell open.</p>

<p>Lew closed it with the fist which still gripped the razor case. The man's teeth came together with a sharp click. His knees were buckling as Lew brushed past him and out the door.</p>

<p>The elevator was just down the hall, with the doors standing open. And nobody coming. Lew stepped in and punched O. He shaved as the elevator dropped. The razor cut fast and close, if a trifle noisily. He was working on his chest as the door opened.</p>

<p>A skinny technician stood directly in front of him, her mouth and eyes set in the utterly blank expression of those who wait for elevators. She brushed past him with a muttered apology, hardly noticing him. Lew stepped out fast. The doors were closing before he realized that he was on the wrong floor.</p>

<p>That damned tech! She'd stopped the elevator before it reached bottom.</p>

<p>He turned and stabbed the Down button. Then what he'd seen in that one cursory glance came back to him, and his head whipped around for another look.</p>

<p>The whole vast room was filled with glass tanks, ceiling height, arranged in a labyrinth like the bookcases in a library. In the tanks was a display more lewd than anything in Belsen. Why, those things had been <i>men</i>! and <i>women</i>! No, he wouldn't look. He refused to look at anything but the elevator door. <i>What was taking that elevator so long</i>?</p>

<p>He heard a siren.</p>

<p>The hard tile floor began to vibrate against his bare feet. He felt a numbness in his muscles, a lethargy in his soul.</p>

<p>The elevator arrived &hellip; too late. He blocked the doors open with a chair. Most buildings didn't have stairs; only alternate elevators. They'd have to use the alternate elevator to reach him now. Well, where was it? &hellip; He wouldn't have time to find it. He was beginning to feel really sleepy. They must have several sonic projectors focused on this one room. Where one beam passed the interns would feel mildly relaxed, a little clumsy. But where the beams intersected, <i>here</i>, there would be unconsciousness. But not yet.</p>

<p>He had something to do first.</p>

<p>By the time they broke in they'd have something to kill him for.</p>

<p>The tanks were faced in plastic, not glass: a very special kind of plastic. To avoid provoking defense reactions in all the myriads of body parts which might be stored touching it, the plastic had to have unique characteristics. No engineer could have been expected to make it shatterproof too!</p>

<p>It shattered very satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Later, Lew wondered how he managed to stay up as long as he did. The soothing hypersonic murmur of the stun beams kept pulling at him, pulling him down to a floor which seemed softer every moment. The chair he wielded became heavier and heavier. But as long as he could lift it, he smashed. He was knee deep in nutritive storage fluid, and there were dying things brushing against his ankles with every move; but his work was barely a third done when the silent siren song became too much for him.</p>

<p>He fell.</p>

<p>And after all that they never even mentioned the smashed organ banks!</p>

<p>Sitting in the courtroom, listening to the drone of courtroom ritual, Lew sought Mr. Broxton's ear to ask the question. Mr. Broxton smiled at him. <q>Why should they want to bring that up? They think they've got enough on you as it is. If you beat <i>this</i> rap, then they'll persecute you for wanton destruction of valuable medical sources. But they're sure you won't.</q></p>

<p><q>And you?</q></p>

<p><q>I'm afraid they're right. But we'll try. Now, Hennessey's about to read the charges. Can you manage to look hurt and indignant?</q></p>

<p><q>Sure.</q></p>

<p><q>Good.</q></p>

<p>The persecution read the charges, his voice sounding like the voice of doom coming from under a thin blond mustache. Warren Lewis Knowles looked hurt and indignant. But he no longer felt that way. He had done something worth dying for.</p>

<p>The cause of it all was the organ banks. With good doctors and a sufficient flow of material in the organ banks, any taxpayer could hope to live indefinitely. What voter would vote against eternal life? The death penalty was his immortality, and he would vote the death penalty for any crime at all.</p>

<p>Lewis Knowles had struck back.</p>

<p><q>The state will prove that the said Warren Lewis Knowles did, in the space of two years, willfully drive through a total of six red traffic lights. During that same period the same Warren Knowles exceeded local speed limits no less than ten times, once by as much as fifteen miles per hour. His record has never been good. We will produce records of his arrest in 2082 on a charge of drunk driving, a charge of which he was acquitted only through—</q></p>

<p><q>Objection!</q></p>

<p><q>Sustained. If he was acquitted, Counselor, the Court must assume him not guilty.</q></p>

<hr/>

<p>Afterword:</p>

<p>There's an organ bank in your future, or your grandchildren's. Nothing short of a world holocaust could stop it. The rapid advance in transplant techniques is common knowledge. Many of the greats of science fiction have written on the organ bank problem, because it is so inevitable and because it is so interesting.</p>

<p>The following should not provoke arguments, but it has, and will:</p>

<p>Human technology can change human morals.</p>

<p>If you doubt it, consider: dynamite, gunpowder, the printing press, the cotton gin, modern advertising techniques, psychology. Consider the automobile: it is now immoral to go home at all after a New Years’ Eve party. (Unless you take a cab, which cannot be done except at gunpoint.) Consider the cobalt bomb, which has made total war immoral. Was total war immoral before the cobalt bomb? In 1945 the Allies demanded nothing less than total defeat for Germany. Were they wrong? Did you say so at the time? <i>I</i> didn't (being seven years old) and don't (at twenty-eight).</p>

<p>What happens when the death of one genuine criminal can save the lives of twenty taxpayers? Morals change.</p>

<p>Much of the science/art of psychology has dealt with rehabilitation of criminals. These techniques will soon be forgotten lore, like alchemy.</p>

<p>But organ transplants are only half the story. Alloplasty, the science and empirical technique of putting foreign matter in the human body for medical purposes, is a combating influence. Thousands walk today's streets with metal pacemakers in their hearts, nylon tubing replacing sections of artery, plastic valves replacing the organic valves in the large veins, transparent insets in the lenses of their eyes. When alloplasty heals a man, nobody dies.</p>

<p>You may think of the next five hundred years as a footrace between two techniques, alloplasty and organ transplantation. But organ transplantation will win. It is a simpler set of techniques.</p>

<p>The good side of organ transplantation is very good indeed. As long as the organ banks don't run short of materials, any citizen can live as long as his central nervous system holds out, since the doctors can keep shoving spare parts into him as fast as the old ones wear out. How long can the brain live with a dependable, youthful blood supply? It's your guess. I say centuries.</p>

<p>But, with centuries of life at stake, what citizen will vote against the death penalty for: false advertising, habitual jaywalking, rudeness, cheating on income tax, having children without a license? Or (and here's the real danger) criticizing government policy? Given the organ banks, <q>The Jigsaw Man</q> is a glimpse into the best of possible futures. The worst is a never-ending dictatorship.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day 1965, Harlan told me he was collecting material for an anthology. I was halfway through a novel dealing with the organ bank problem on one of Earth's interstellar colonies (almost finished), and I took time out to demonstrate how the problem may affect Earth.</p>

<p>I think I could have sold the story anywhere. But it will cause arguments, thus fulfilling its purpose. Because someone has to start thinking about this. We haven't much time. It's only an accident of history that Red Cross blood banks aren't supplied by the death house. Think of the advantages—and worry.</p>
