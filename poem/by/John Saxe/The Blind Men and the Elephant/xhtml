<title>The Blind Men and the Elephant</title>
<author>John Saxe</author>

<stanza>
<line>It was six men of Indostan</line>
<line>to learning much inclined,</line>
<line>who went to see the elephant</line>
<line><em>(though all of them were blind)</em>,</line>
<line>that each by observation</line>
<line>might satisfy his mind.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The first approached the elephant,</line>
<line>and, happening to fall</line>
<line>against his broad and sturdy side,</line>
<line>at once began to bawl,</line>
<line><q class="continued">God bless me! but the elephant</q></line>
<line><q class="continuation">is very like a wall!</q></line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The second, feeling of the tusk</line>
<line>cried: <q class="continued">Ho! What have we here</q></line>
<line>so very round and smooth and sharp?</line>
<line>To me 'tis mighty clear</line>
<line>this wonder of an elephant</line>
<line><q class="continuation">is very like a spear!</q></line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The third approached the animal,</line>
<line>and, happening to take</line>
<line>the squirming trunk within his hands,</line>
<line>thus boldly up and spake:</line>
<line><q>I see,</q> quoth he, <q class="continued">the elephant,</q></line>
<line><q class="continuation">is very like a snake!</q></line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The fourth reached out his eager hand,</line>
<line>and felt about the knee;</line>
<line><q class="continued">What most this wondrous beast is like</q></line>
<line><q class="continuation">is mighty plain,</q> quoth he;</line>
<line><q class="continued">'Tis clear enough the elephant</q></line>
<line><q class="continuation">is very like a tree.</q></line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,</line>
<line>said: <q class="continued">E'en the blindest man</q></line>
<line>can tell what this resembles most.</line>
<line>Deny the fact who can,</line>
<line>this marvel of an elephant</line>
<line><q class="continuation">is very like a fan!</q></line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The sixth no sooner had begun</line>
<line>about the beast to grope,</line>
<line>than, seizing on the swinging tail</line>
<line>that fell within his scope,</line>
<line><q>I see,</q> quoth he, <q class="continued">the elephant</q></line>
<line><q class="continuation">is very like a rope!</q></line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And so these men of Indostan</line>
<line>disputed loud and long,</line>
<line>each in his own opinion</line>
<line>exceeding stiff and strong,</line>
<line>though each was partly in the right,</line>
<line>and all were in the wrong!</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>So, oft in theologic wars</line>
<line>the disputants, I ween,</line>
<line>rail on in utter ignorance</line>
<line>of what each other mean,</line>
<line>and prate about an elephant</line>
<line>not one of them has seen!</line>
