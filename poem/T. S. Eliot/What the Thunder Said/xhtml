    <h1>What the Thunder Said</h1>
    <h2>T. S. Eliot</h2>

    <p>After the torchlight red on sweaty faces<br/>
After the frosty silence in the gardens<br/>
After the agony in stony places<br/>
The shouting and the crying<br/>
Prison and palace and reverberation<br/>
Of thunder of spring over distant mountains<br/>
He who was living is now dead<br/>
We who were living are now dying<br/>
<a id="l330"/>With a little patience</p>

<p>Here is no water but only rock<br/>
Rock and no water and the sandy road<br/>
The road winding above among the mountains<br/>
Which are mountains of rock without water<br/>
If there were water we should stop and drink<br/>
Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think<br/>
Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand<br/>
If there were only water amongst the rock<br/>
Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit<br/>
<a id="l340"/>Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit<br/>
There is not even silence in the mountains<br/>
But dry sterile thunder without rain<br/>
There is not even solitude in the mountains<br/>
But red sullen faces sneer and snarl<br/>
From doors of mudcracked houses<br/>
If there were water<br/>
And no rock<br/>
If there were rock<br/>
And also water<br/>
<a id="l350"/>And water<br/>
A spring<br/>
A pool among the rock<br/>
If there were the sound of water only<br/>
Not the cicada<br/>
And dry grass singing<br/>
But sound of water over a rock<br/>
Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees<br/>
Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop<br/>
But there is no water</p>

<p id="l360">Who is the third who walks always beside you?<br/>
When I count, there are only you and I together<br/>
But when I look ahead up the white road<br/>
There is always another one walking beside you<br/>
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded<br/>
I do not know whether a man or a woman<br/>
—But who is that on the other side of you?</p>

<p>What is that sound high in the air<br/>
Murmur of maternal lamentation<br/>
Who are those hooded hordes swarming<br/>
<a id="l370"/>Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth<br/>
Ringed by the flat horizon only<br/>
What is the city over the mountains<br/>
Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air<br/>
Falling towers<br/>
Jerusalem Athens Alexandria<br/>
Vienna London<br/>
Unreal</p>

<p>A woman drew her long black hair out tight<br/>
And fiddled whisper music on those strings<br/>
<a id="l380"/>And bats with baby faces in the violet light<br/>
Whistled, and beat their wings<br/>
And crawled head downward down a blackened wall<br/>
And upside down in air were towers<br/>
Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours<br/>
And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.</p>

<p>In this decayed hole among the mountains<br/>
In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing<br/>
Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel<br/>
There is the empty chapel, only the wind's home.<br/>
<a id="l390"/>It has no windows, and the door swings,<br/>
Dry bones can harm no one.<br/>
Only a cock stood on the rooftree<br/>
Co co rico co co rico<br/>
In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust<br/>
Bringing rain</p>

<p>Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves<br/>
Waited for rain, while the black clouds<br/>
Gathered far distant, over Himavant.<br/>
The jungle crouched, humped in silence.<br/>
<a id="l400"/>Then spoke the thunder<br/>
DA<br/>
Datta: what have we given?<br/>
My friend, blood shaking my heart<br/>
The awful daring of a moment's surrender<br/>
Which an age of prudence can never retract<br/>
By this, and this only, we have existed<br/>
Which is not to be found in our obituaries<br/>
Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider<br/>
Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor<br/>
<a id="l410"/>In our empty rooms<br/>
DA<br/>
Dayadhvam: I have heard the key<br/>
Turn in the door once and turn once only<br/>
We think of the key, each in his prison<br/>
Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison<br/>
Only at nightfall, aetherial rumours<br/>
Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus<br/>
DA<br/>
Damyata: The boat responded<br/>
<a id="l420"></a>Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar<br/>
The sea was calm, your heart would have responded<br/>
Gaily, when invited, beating obedient<br/>
To controlling hands</p>

<p>I sat upon the shore<br/>
Fishing, with the arid plain behind me<br/>
Shall I at least set my lands in order?<br/>
London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down<br/>
Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina<br/>
Quando fiam ceu chelidon - O swallow swallow<br/>
<a id="l430"></a>Le Prince d'Aquitaine a la tour abolie<br/>
These fragments I have shored against my ruins<br/>
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo's mad againe.<br/>
Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.<br/>
                           Shantih    shantih    shantih</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the first part of Part V three themes are employed:
the journey to Emmaus, the approach to the Chapel Perilous
(see Miss Weston's book) and the present decay of eastern Europe.</p>
<p>This is Turdus aonalaschkae pallasii, the hermit-thrush
which I have heard in Quebec County.  Chapman says (Handbook of
Birds of Eastern North America) "it is most at home in secluded
woodland and thickety retreats…. Its notes are not remarkable
for variety or volume, but in purity and sweetness of tone and
exquisite modulation they are unequalled."  Its "water-dripping song"
is justly celebrated.</p>
<p>The following lines were stimulated by the account of one
of the Antarctic expeditions (I forget which, but I think one
of Shackleton's): it was related that the party of explorers,
at the extremity of their strength, had the constant delusion
that there was one more member than could actually be counted.</p>
<p>Cf.  Hermann Hesse, Blick ins Chaos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schon ist halb Europa, schon ist zumindest der halbe Osten Europas auf dem
Wege zum Chaos, fährt betrunken im heiligem Wahn am Abgrund entlang
und singt dazu, singt betrunken und hymnisch wie Dmitri Karamasoff sang.
Ueber diese Lieder lacht der Bürger beleidigt, der Heilige
und Seher hört sie mit Tränen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[Already half of Europe, already at least half of
Eastern Europe, on the way to Chaos, drives drunk in sacred
infatuation along the edge of the precipice, sings drunkenly, as
though hymn singing, as Dmitri Karamazov [in Dostoyevski's Brothers
Karamazov] sang. The offended bourgeois laughs at the songs; the saint
and the seer hear them with tears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><q>Datta, dayadhvam, damyata</q> — <q>Give, sympathize, control</q></p>
<p>The <a href="/t/rel/upanishads/brihadaranyaka5-2.html" target="_top">fable of the meaning of the Thunder</a> is found
in the <a href="/t/rel/upanishads/brihadaranyaka.html" target="_top">Brihadaranyaka-Upanishad</a>, 5, 1.  A translation is found
in Deussen's Sechzig Upanishads des Veda, p.  489.</p><p>[The Hindu fable referred to is that of gods, men, and demons
each in turn asking of their father Prajapati, “<span class="quote">Speak to us, O Lord.</span>”
To each he replied with the one syllable “<span class="quote">DA,</span>” and each group
interpreted it in a different way: “<span class="quote">Datta,</span>” to give alms; “<span class="quote">Dayadhvam,</span>”
to have compassion; “<span class="quote">Damyata,</span>” to practice self-control. The fable
concludes, “<span class="quote">This is what the divine voice, the Thunder, repeats when
he says: DA, DA, DA: ‘<span class="quote">Control yourselves; give alms; be
compassionate.</span>’ Therefore one should practice these three things:
self-control, alms-giving, and compassion.</span>”</p>

<p>Cf.  Webster, The White Devil, v.  vi:</p>
<p>          …they'll remarry<br/>
Ere the worm pierce your winding-sheet, ere the spider<br/>
Make a thin curtain for your epitaphs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cf. <a href="/t/lit/divine-comedy-longfellow/Inferno/canto33.html#v16" target="_top">Inferno, xxxiii.  46</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ed io sentii chiavar l'uscio di sotto all'orribile torre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also F. H. Bradley, Appearance and Reality, p.  346:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My external sensations are no less private to myself than are my
thoughts or my feelings.  In either case my experience falls within
my own circle, a circle closed on the outside; and, with all its
elements alike, every sphere is opaque to the others which surround
it. … In brief, regarded as an existence which appears in a soul,
the whole world for each is peculiar and private to that soul.</p>

<p>“<span class="quote">Ara vos prec per aquella valor<br/>
 que vos guida al som de l'escalina,<br/>
 sovegna vos a temps de ma dolor.</span>”<br/>
 Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina.</p>
