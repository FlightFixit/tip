Full many a glorious morning have I seen
 Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
 Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
 With ugly rack on his celestial face,
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
 Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
